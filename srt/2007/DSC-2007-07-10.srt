00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Port City PD, the number one online police drama series, is now available.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,720
The pod father had a cameo in the season 1 finale, who will be making cameo appearances

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,880
in season 2.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,920
You, me, get in on the action, portcity.podshow.com.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
All excuses.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No BS.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Delta share a Charlie 632.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:24,120
We met on the subway, I paid on a million tickets, so glad we had the screen in

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:34,120
the last class, we'll come and take a pop star, and build on the red aback.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:02:04,120
I love you, you know, I love you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:19,920
you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, speaking, you know, yeah, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know

14
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,920
If you're not gonna blow my lemon

15
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
I know that's gonna come in

16
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
She gives it sugar for free

17
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
What's more, she goes in the fog

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Didn't even stop to my car

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Come on now

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
I love you, keep it lighter

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
I love you, I love you, I love you

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,920
I love you, keep it lighter

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Give me,ï¿½, give me, baby

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
I love you, keep it lighter

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,740
I love you, I love you, now

26
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,720
tell, I love you, keep it, keep it!

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

29
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

30
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

32
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

33
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

40
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Well, you know, what why you know, what can I say?

41
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Okay, you know, what can I say?

42
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Well, you know, what can I say?

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Well, whatever you do, all I'll tell you about.

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Some of us are, you know, as Gilbert run the west side and the curry meta.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Thank you, Jersey Joe for reminding me that this is such an awesome song.

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,920
It's been on the positive news and network for two years now.

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Every single time, it's like, oh, yes, casing the sunshine band live again.

49
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Only backwards and somehow more modernize.

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I'd like it.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,920
And, you know, it's got some cow build.

52
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
It just can't go on.

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Hey, it's a pretty darn late here in Adam's attic.

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
It's 1140 p.m.

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
It's been a long day.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I didn't have any time at all to do a show this morning.

57
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,920
As a super agent Keith and GameFace Allen,

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,920
our fearless, our fearless publicist here in the UK.

59
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Dr. Cockley and I running all over town today.

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
So it was very, very busy.

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,920
And of course, there is somewhat of a commute between the east side of London.

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,920
And the west side of G-town.

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,920
So yeah, and then I want to spend a little bit of time with Patricia,

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,920
because as you know, Christina is still often, what's it called?

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Newkey.

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Newkey, you know, the place where there's hundreds of kids drink and have

67
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
in section running around naked.

68
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,920
So we watched a big brother together.

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
We love Brian, by the way.

70
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
For those of you in the UK listening to the show, Brian,

71
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I just, you know, this guy just cracks me up.

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,920
He's so, so completely honest and really childlike simplicity

73
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,920
that just makes him a beautiful, beautiful person.

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
So we're big, big fans, props, big up to the Brian.

75
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
And then we, of course, watched the,

76
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
the evening's episode of East Enders.

77
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
We got to keep up.

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,920
And then I said, I mean, I got to do a show.

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
And for just this, you know, you're tired now.

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
But when you're doing, you'll enjoy it and you'll have fun.

81
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
I said, I know.

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
But it's like, and I, and of course throughout the day,

83
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm always plucking things left and right out of the email

84
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
and saving it with my Google notebook.

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
And, but I still go through the voicemails.

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,920
And now that I figured out that I wasn't receiving all the voicemails,

87
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
that they were basically getting stuck at j2.com

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
and not being forwarded.

89
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Dude, there's like 30, 40 messages a day.

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
And there's a lot to go through.

91
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
And all of it's good.

92
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Like 95% of it is good.

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
But most of it's just way too long.

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
A lot of it, you know, it's, it's interesting though,

95
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,920
when you get like 10 messages about the same topic,

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
that's kind of my clue, you know.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
But when, when I get a message like this,

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,920
this is when I really just break out in a big ass smile.

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
I don't, James again, call you.

100
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
We're sick of my voice today.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
And the penny's just dropped.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,920
If the penny is just dropped, I get its channels.

103
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I understand it.

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
You mentioned the Patricia's channels.

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,920
And it just, something clicked and we had got it on the

106
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
market.

107
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
I'll be certainly doing this tonight.

108
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,920
It's exactly fantastic.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Brilliant.

110
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Just right.

111
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Alright, penny dropped on James of North.

112
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Fantastic.

113
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,920
You know, we'll be talking a little bit about channels later on in this program.

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
I haven't spoken to Andrew and Devon today.

115
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I hope to get a hold of him tomorrow to find out if we can put some of this editing

116
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
functionality live.

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Because I'm ready.

118
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You know, I know you guys are ready.

119
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
I got a, uh, gosh, who was that from?

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I got an awesome email today from, uh, what was his name?

121
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Matt.

122
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
I think.

123
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, my second.

124
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah, here it is.

125
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Matt M.

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,920
And he made a tour to France channel, which is like, wow, what a great idea.

127
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
It's a TDF dot pod show dot com.

128
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
TDF dot BT pod show dot com.

129
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
You can get there from pod show dot com as well.

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Go delta foxtrot dot BT pod show dot com.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,920
And he's got, you know, like four or five shows in there that are tracking the

132
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Tour de France.

133
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm like, I was kicking myself.

134
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
And we had a meeting today.

135
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I said, I can't believe it.

136
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
One of the largest sporting events in Europe.

137
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
And we just like totally spaced on it.

138
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,920
And there's shows about it that are running, you know, right in our channels.

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,920
The, you know, of course, uh, I know that Matt would love to be able to have

140
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
a little more extra control over that.

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
So I can't wait to get you guys all this editing functionality.

142
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
It's going to be great.

143
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
So that was one message that made me smile.

144
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
But then this next one, this really just put me into the stratosphere.

145
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,920
And I'm so, so, so incredibly happy with this comment.

146
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Hey, Adam.

147
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
This is Dean Alon, San Diego.

148
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Long time listeners since the castle in Holland.

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I love that.

150
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
The castle was in Belgium, by the way, in Antwerp.

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,920
But so yeah, you are a long time listener.

152
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
I want, even maybe before it was called the Daily Source Code days when we're just

153
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
mucking about.

154
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Well, welcome.

155
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Glad to have you.

156
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I was listening to your most recent, uh, DSC talking about what I refer to as

157
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,920
global hysteria or the fear industrial complex.

158
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,920
That was about, uh, live earth and, uh, your questions about global warming.

159
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
I'm not so sure that it's not true.

160
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,920
The things are changing and it's important to pay attention to them.

161
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,920
And listen to science, but there's, I'm as, uh, if you're as old as I am,

162
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I'm a 53 and I've been to a lot of stairs.

163
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Uh, I refer to them as the politics of fear, fear industrial complex.

164
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I love, I love this, uh, term fear industrial complex.

165
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Fick.

166
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Which means fuck in German.

167
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
I suppose a little differently.

168
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
But fear industrial complex.

169
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Great.

170
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Now stand by because he's going to list off the scares.

171
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
And I've already heard this comment.

172
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Uh, but I can't wait for you to hear it because you're going to go.

173
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh, yeah.

174
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Oh, yeah.

175
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
What happened to that?

176
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Yeah.

177
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
You're going to, at the end of this, you're going to think,

178
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
I should be dead.

179
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
People with hysteria.

180
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,920
People feeding us information trying to terrify us.

181
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
I mean, us eating it up.

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
I've been through overpopulation.

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Herpes.

184
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Second hand smoke.

185
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Global cooling.

186
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
You remember global cooling?

187
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Oh, yes.

188
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Oh, it was going to be the, the, the second ice age.

189
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Absolutely.

190
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
It's a kid.

191
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Do I remember global cooling?

192
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
You've had you.

193
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Is we're going to get really cold in the 70s.

194
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Asteroids destroying the worth.

195
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
The earth.

196
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Hector sexual aids.

197
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Stars.

198
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Bird flu.

199
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Running out of oil.

200
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Poison holes.

201
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Nuclear winter.

202
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Zombie computers.

203
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Millennium bugs.

204
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Remember why?

205
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Okay.

206
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Uh-huh.

207
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Now I've spent a lot of time working on that one as an IT professional.

208
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
High fructose corn syrup.

209
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Ebola.

210
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
The African ice bees.

211
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
I'm in seven California.

212
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
We're going to get us.

213
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
It hasn't happened yet.

214
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
And tracks.

215
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Transfats.

216
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Cyclomates.

217
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
You open up your member's cyclomates.

218
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Before sacred.

219
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Diamond is.

220
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
A-lar.

221
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
The stuff they put on apples.

222
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
And math cow disease.

223
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Just a few.

224
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, man.

225
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
That's just not funny.

226
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Denny Crane really has mad cow disease, okay?

227
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Things that we have to worry about.

228
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,920
We're terrified about for at least a limited amount of time.

229
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I want you to know that I believe in science.

230
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
And I want to find out what's happening.

231
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Not necessarily from a rock star or ramping on stage.

232
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Or even the next vice president.

233
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Though I'm sure it's hard to write place.

234
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Hope you have a great day.

235
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
This is Denny Law.

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Spanish phrase.

237
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
The day dot blogs.com.

238
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
For the text in your comments.

239
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Folder.

240
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
With a sink wrench.

241
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Bye bye now.

242
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
What was that the end?

243
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Let us sink a wrench, what?

244
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Or even the next vice president.

245
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
So I'm sure it's hard to write place.

246
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
What was that?

247
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Hope you have a great day.

248
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
This is Denny Law.

249
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Spanish phrase.

250
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
The day dot blogs.com.

251
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
For the text in your comments.

252
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Folder.

253
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
With a sink wrench.

254
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Bye bye now.

255
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Damn.

256
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I must be going deaf.

257
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
I can't understand it.

258
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Anyway, Denny.

259
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Thank you so much for calling and I really appreciate it.

260
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
So a couple things there.

261
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Absolutely.

262
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Absolutely.

263
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
This is.

264
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,920
You know, I, of course, I watched quite a bit of live earth because the BBC and my Sky Box

265
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
at work perfectly together.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
I could watch the US feed, the far east feeds.

267
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
That was mainly Australia, but also Tokyo.

268
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
The UK feed.

269
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
There was a delayed UK feed.

270
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
I mean, it was pretty amazing technology at work.

271
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
And I told you, I was skeptical of this whole event.

272
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
And, you know, of all the things you want to say about it.

273
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You know, I just want to say one thing.

274
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Enough already with people getting on stage and saying that the whole world is watching.

275
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Because the ratings are in.

276
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,920
And 2.7 million people watch this during prime time,

277
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,920
which was less than a rerun of monsters ink.

278
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
So I'm sorry.

279
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,920
If in the largest television market in the world at this moment,

280
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,920
you know, you only, you know, are able to draw in 2.7 million people.

281
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
See, Holland drew in more people than that.

282
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I think they had 3 million people watching in prime time.

283
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
So maybe they had maybe maybe maybe 50.

284
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Maybe they had 50 million worldwide that were watching.

285
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
And aggregate maybe a little bit more.

286
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
But certainly not 2 billion or half a billion.

287
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Everyone was using a different number.

288
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
And so just stop it, okay.

289
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Stop with that untruth.

290
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
And stop kidding yourselves.

291
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
It's just not true.

292
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
You know, and we're really selling advertising based upon those numbers.

293
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
You got a lot of make-dos to figure out my friends.

294
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
So of all of that, that just was not true.

295
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
There was not a 2 billion people watching.

296
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
The numbers just don't add up.

297
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,920
But what you were saying there is something,

298
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,920
you'll Brian know he's one half of the team we affectionately call the production guys.

299
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Brian and Peter, they are.

300
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
What is it?

301
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Two cheeks of the same arse, I think, is the expression we use here on the Charlie.

302
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,920
He sent me a book, which showed up in San Francisco on my desk.

303
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,920
And let me tell you, there is nothing that you make me happier with

304
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
than a book.

305
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,920
When someone sends you a book, it's like someone cooking for you.

306
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
You know, there's a real act of love in there.

307
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,920
It's a real intellectual, deep spiritual thing.

308
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,920
And actually, my favorite books are big colorful coffee books.

309
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
You know, with lots of big pictures.

310
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Those are the ones I like the most.

311
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
But I love reading books.

312
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
And I don't get enough time.

313
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
This one has been next to my bed.

314
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
It's been on my bed stand for the past.

315
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Well, since I got back from San Francisco, I tried to read a little bit of it on the airplane.

316
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,920
But I was so tired that I just slept most of the way.

317
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,920
It's, by a Frenchman, Gideboir, it's called the Society of the Spectacle.

318
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
And it's a, I find that a very difficult book to read.

319
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Although it's, it's not really complicated and structure.

320
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,920
It's just, you have to, there's no real beginning.

321
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
It just dives into what the spectacle is.

322
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
And if you think about the Society of the Spectacle,

323
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
and that list, that the Dana just read,

324
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
that's kind of what this is all about.

325
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
And how human culture works.

326
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,920
And, you know, there really is, we really aren't in a type of matrix.

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,920
You know, I don't think that movie was too far off.

328
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
We are connected.

329
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Only we may not be lying in pods, but we're connected through mobile devices and computers and cell phones.

330
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,920
And we are really making the machine work.

331
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,920
We're feeding it through blog posts that go up through mainstream media.

332
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
And all the wires are interconnecting.

333
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
And it really is red pill blue pill stuff.

334
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
You know, except all you have to do is just realize it.

335
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
And that's the red pill.

336
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,920
You know, and if you don't, and if you just are happily enjoying the,

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
the instantaneous hit of receiving an email on your blackberry,

338
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,920
then you're, you know, a blue pill person.

339
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Hmm.

340
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Maybe we should move on from scrunchers and folders to a red pill blue pill.

341
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Because it really has that vibe to it.

342
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
And think of all those things, all those disasters.

343
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
And of course, you know, asteroids.

344
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,920
You know, we've solved all of those in the blue pill world with the Bruce Willis,

345
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,920
showing up to, to save the day and we feel comfortable.

346
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
And we don't really worry about that.

347
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,920
But I, I think we really don't worry about it because of Bruce Willis.

348
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,920
I have to say, right up front, I am definitely a red pill kind of guy.

349
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Dear diary, today I got the throat of someone named Carl Bishop.

350
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,920
When a man can't stop his desire to commit murder, what does he do?

351
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Especially when his victims are other serial killers.

352
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,920
From the mind of Mark Yoshimoto-Namkoff, author of Number One with the bullet,

353
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,920
and Shadow Falls, Badlands, comes his most twisted novel yet,

354
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,920
diary of a madman.

357
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Dear diary.

358
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
I don't know who's next.

359
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,920
And I don't think I can stop myself.

360
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Ah, Namcoff, you're amazing.

361
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
That's going to be so cool.

362
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
All these podshow press things.

363
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,920
It's, I love, I really, really love the audio novels.

364
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
You know, the audio novels.

365
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Episodic audio novels.

366
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
It's just, it's brilliant.

367
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
It works so well.

368
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Mark, Scott, you guys are, you're on to something really big, really, really big.

369
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,920
While I go, the official biographer of the Charlie, Tom from Down Under,

370
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,920
sent me a cassette tape that was amongst the collection that I shipped off to him.

371
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,920
And it was apparently, actually was written on the cassette,

372
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Vic 20 Basic Program.

373
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,920
And that's from my Vic 20 Commodore computer.

374
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
That's predates the Commodore 64.

375
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
And you would actually store computer programs on a magnetic tape.

376
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,920
And so I played it and said, you know, could someone please figure this out.

377
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,920
I'll just, just to remind you, and please be, for warned,

378
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
it's very annoying sound.

379
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,920
This is, what I think is a program written in basic recorded on the cassette tape.

380
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Yeah.

381
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
It really hurts.

382
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,920
So Oscar from Holland, Oscar the nerd said he was going to dive into it.

383
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
And he's back.

384
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Yo, Adam, this is Oscar speaking from the Netherlands.

385
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
So I've got some information for you.

386
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
First off, Vic 20.

387
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
You know, the damn sound.

388
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Well, besides hearing my ears and everybody else's,

389
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,920
we kind of tried to crack the code with the problem of the world.

390
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
It wasn't a code.

391
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,920
So here comes a little tin foil half a moment.

392
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,920
The thing is, what you actually heard, I call it, deciphered it.

393
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,920
It wasn't even somebody else who could decipher it.

394
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Basically, the only thing that you heard, halfway the sound,

395
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
was a little beep.

396
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,920
And that was actually an end marker for whatever information was there.

397
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Not information that you heard was a basically a pointer to where

398
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,920
the data actually is on tape, so the program.

399
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
So the only thing you had was a listing.

400
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Ah, okay.

401
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I get it.

402
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
That's right.

403
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I remember you used to record the programs, but the tape would have like an index at the beginning.

404
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
So it was probably just the index.

405
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,920
And then the cassette player would actually fast forward to a point into the next piece of data.

406
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I think it would detect the data.

407
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
And then it would rewind it a little bit.

408
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
This is going back.

409
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Oh, climb up on on grandpa grandfather's knee here.

410
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,920
And I'll tell you a story about how you used to store computer programs.

411
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,920
So what it is, I don't know yet.

412
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,920
We tried to decipher the listing, but it's so full barred because of the compression of the

413
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,920
MP3 that we really have a bad time recovering it.

414
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,920
So this is a little pet project, but anyway, full barred.

415
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah.

416
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Next thing.

417
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I went to Sweden because of my work.

418
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Okay.

419
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Hold on a second.

420
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,920
So first of all, before you get into Sweden, which I'm also interested in.

421
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I'll have Tom digitized the rest of the tape.

422
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,920
And now it would be really easy to just send you the tape, but I don't want to do that.

423
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
So I'll have Tom digitized it.

424
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Real high resin P3, like 356.

425
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
It does that exist.

426
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Like 320 or 340 kilobit encoding rate or something like that.

427
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,920
And then I'll put it into my daily source code channel.

428
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
And you can pick it up from there.

429
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
And let's see if we can figure it out.

430
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
It's so awesome.

431
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
I really appreciate the work.

432
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
All right.

433
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
What about Sweden?

434
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I've been to Stockholm before.

435
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Tell me what's up.

436
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Look at the physics lab.

437
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Oh, of course.

438
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
And how come that doesn't surprise me?

439
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
You work in Stockholm for the physics lab.

440
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,920
We didn't have the cloud all over the city.

441
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Not the Wi-Fi.

442
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Not everywhere, but most places.

443
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
Yeah, that works.

444
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Downtown.

445
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
So you might like that if you would go to Stockholm once.

446
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Definitely.

447
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I was in London today.

448
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
And I have my N800.

449
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,920
The Nokia Internet tablet, which by the way, man, you're going to love this.

450
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I flashed it.

451
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,920
So I got a new OS update and just the new software.

452
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
And it now has Skype built right in.

453
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
We have to download it.

454
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
But it works.

455
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
It's unbelievable.

456
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
It's great.

457
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You can chat.

458
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
This is what I've been looking for.

459
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Mobile Skype.

460
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
And it's really pretty.

461
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,920
I mean, I haven't gotten my iPhone yet.

462
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
It is.

463
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
I think it got FedEx today.

464
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
But this is working pretty well for me.

465
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Only the headphones are really soft though.

466
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I don't know if it's just me if I'm going deaf or is the output of the headphones.

467
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Really, really soft on the Skype client.

468
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
I don't know.

469
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,920
The speaker phone is nice and loud, but the headphones seem pretty soft.

470
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
And in general, the thing seems fast.

471
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It's playing flash videos now.

472
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,920
People talking about the iPhone playing flash or not playing flash and all kinds of secrets

473
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
and conspiracy theories.

474
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
These phones, they really just don't have the horsepower.

475
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
That's the real problem.

476
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
The Nokia.

477
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
It's okay.

478
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
You can get the gist of what's playing.

479
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
But it's still pretty delayed.

480
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
And you know, it's just the machine just can't handle it.

481
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
It's just too much processing.

482
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
It's just a problem.

483
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
All right.

484
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Back to Stockholm.

485
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,920
And the other thing is scalability.

486
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
You mentioned that you had scalability issues.

487
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Well, yeah, you know, we were talking about pod show.

488
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Basically aggregating hundreds of thousands of feeds.

489
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,920
And you know, how you prioritize that and how you figure out which ones need to be hit

490
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
more regularly.

491
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,920
And you know, meanwhile, a parallel working on, you know, integrating

492
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Ping server data.

493
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Yeah, it's a big ass job.

494
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Going on with your freaking networks.

495
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Well, we understand that.

496
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,920
We have a big scaling thing going on at our place, which may be calling me for

497
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
next time.

498
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,920
But the thing is, once the very wise man said from hotmail from the MSN services,

499
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
said, well, what we're doing is just email.

500
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
The thing is the scale is so large.

501
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,920
You can see for such a simple application that all kinds of funny things

502
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
happen.

503
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,920
And I can imagine that the pod show network is dealing with the same kind of scalability

504
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
issues.

505
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Getting so big.

506
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,920
It's hard to keep it all together.

507
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Well, maybe two next time.

508
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Bye.

509
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah, man.

510
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Oh, my name is Oscar.

511
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Yeah, of course.

512
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Oscar the nerd.

513
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Dude, thank you.

514
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Really appreciate the work that's going to do that.

515
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
That's kind of a fun project.

516
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
We should document that and put that up in a weblog.

517
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Because people are going to kick out of it, I think.

518
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
The hell you were saying something there.

519
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
There was kind of, oh, about the scalability.

520
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Yeah, dude.

521
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
It's, thank you.

522
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
I appreciate another nerd acknowledging that.

523
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
There's quite a lot that goes into it.

524
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Yeah, it's all.

525
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,920
In fact, we have a lot of relatively simple applications.

526
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
But you put it all together and you really get some users go.

527
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,920
And yeah, weird things start to happen.

528
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Which really goes beyond all, you know, all imagination often.

529
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,920
You know, the chill cast with Angie B was featured in the front page of the radio time.

530
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
So, was it yesterday or today?

531
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I didn't see it.

532
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,920
If anyone has a scan copy, I'd love to get one.

533
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
That's pretty cool, featuring the chill cast.

534
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
And just a couple more pieces of good feedback that came in today.

535
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Hey, yeah.

536
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I don't know.

537
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,920
It's still calling from Vancedam in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.

538
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Yes, right.

539
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
I know things are kind of cold there.

540
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,920
But today we're on our way up to a very sunny 35 degrees C.

541
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Oh, hot for us.

542
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Thank you.

543
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
I hate you.

544
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Being down at the beach.

545
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Looking out right now.

546
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
And the mountains.

547
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Just wanted to give you a bit of feedback.

548
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Big, big thumbs up for a young hit test.

549
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
I really, really enjoyed that.

550
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,920
And you, I look forward to it every single time you play it.

551
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
And it's kind of fun playing along with you.

552
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,920
But sometimes I'm kind of wondering about, is it just me or does it seem like all the songs that

553
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,920
come from my university days back in the 80s, back when new wave was all the rage.

554
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Back when I even had a bit of a college radio show.

555
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Obviously, nothing of the caliber that you were doing at the time.

556
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Well, you don't say.

557
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,920
But nonetheless, I noticed that a lot of those songs seem to come from my pass.

558
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
So maybe it's part of the soundtrack of my life.

559
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,920
But again, really enjoy your on-sits test.

560
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Pass along the comments to you on and look forward to hearing more of those.

561
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Take care.

562
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
And we'll talk to you later.

563
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Bye.

564
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Well, I tell you a little secret.

565
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:53,920
The hit test for me started out as a, this is something I never talked about before.

566
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,920
You know, young start doing the hit test, putting that together.

567
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:08,920
And from the first episode you put together, my entire use for it was to figure out what the average age of the audience was.

568
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,920
And, you know, I know we have a lot of different data points.

569
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,920
So I know roughly what the age of the audience is.

570
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,920
But there's a physical age and there's a mental age.

571
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,920
And the mental age is a little bit younger than I am.

572
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,920
It's more like, you know, it's around 33.

573
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,920
But it does go up into the 50s.

574
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,920
But that was really, you know, looking at responses, you know, what what people were saying.

575
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,920
They got right and what they got wrong and what music they did or didn't like in the hit test.

576
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:52,920
That really was my, my measurement tool to find out more about the, the natural audience, particularly beginning.

577
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Because I know you want you have a certain type of audience, just going to draw more of the same in general.

578
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:05,920
You know, unless you have like some kind of monster smash that across the board, all the population is listening in.

579
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,920
So, um, so it's now fine tuned to that.

580
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,920
And, and I don't have to do anything because John almost does it automatically.

581
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
That's the beauty of it.

582
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,920
And it's enjoyable. I really, I really like it.

583
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,920
So I figure all you 35 year olds would like to play some video games.

584
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Hi, Adam. It's Matt here from Gamesweasel.

585
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Hi, Adam. It's Matt here from Gamesweasel.

586
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Coming up on my show this week. I've got the review of the new Harry Potter game.

587
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
We've also got a review of SNK's beat them up.

588
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
King of Fighters match them in fact, too.

589
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,920
And some tips on how to save money on all these batteries if you've got wireless controllers.

590
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,920
And of course, competition, you can win transformers on the Nintendo DS.

591
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Yo, Matt.

592
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,920
You know, I'm not a gamer. And I just went right by me.

593
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,920
But I have a feeling that some people really are into it.

594
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,920
All right. I want to do a couple things on channels because there's just so much feedback.

595
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,920
And I'm so delighted with it. And you guys are all relatively short about it.

596
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
But there's some, some really good and some not so good.

597
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
And I just want to try and help.

598
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Hi, Adam. This is a you Dutch guy living in Germany.

599
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Hey, listen, I started checking into this big source code stuff about three months ago.

600
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,920
A colleague of mine has set me up for it. And I must say, I really enjoyed this thing to it.

601
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,920
I hardly listen to my regular radio right now.

602
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm in the car with the earbuds and I just listen to your show.

603
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Hey, what I try doing is I try to set up this channel stuff.

604
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,920
But for some reason, I really don't understand it.

605
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,920
It might be good, I think maybe if you could put like a video somewhere,

606
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
and I could see how it works.

607
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Because for some reason, I just don't get it done.

608
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
If I was just wondering, is it functioning already?

609
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Or is there any way that I can check it out to see how it exactly goes?

610
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
That would really help me a lot.

611
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Well, everybody always ends with saying they're like a folder or something else.

612
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,920
I have no idea what that is. So I can't tell you what I am.

613
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,920
But I look forward to finding out by Adam.

614
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Okay.

615
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Well, you're probably still a blue pill guy.

616
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,920
But we'll bring you over to the red side soon enough.

617
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,920
So the reason why I don't understand that is because it's incomprehensible.

618
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
We built our site upside down.

619
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
So we're turning it right side up.

620
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,920
And then it's going to be very, very, very clear as to how it works.

621
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
So it's not your fault.

622
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,920
The functionality is all there, but it's just it's very difficult to understand.

623
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,920
In fact, it won't be right until, well, this next caller will explain what it has to be.

624
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Hey, Adam, it's Andrew from the Bay Area.

625
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
It's July 9th.

626
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,920
And I've been hearing you happen about channels to last month or two.

627
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,920
And I really tried to decide to subscribe to one.

628
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
All I want to do is subscribe to one of your channels in my eyes.

629
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,920
And I do not do it.

630
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Will you please take 10 seconds on your podcast and explain it.

631
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Can't do it in 10 seconds.

632
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,920
And maybe that's a ticket or something else.

633
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Exactly.

634
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I mean, but I'm not even going to take 10 seconds to explain it.

635
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,920
When we're completely ready, I'll do this for you today,

636
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,920
but it's not exactly the way I want it to be yet because we haven't pushed everything live.

637
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm just going to say, click on this link.

638
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
And that's all you'll have to do.

639
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
I won't have to explain it.

640
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I'll click on the link.

641
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
You'll click on the link.

642
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,920
iTunes opens up and it's going to put the channel in your iTunes.

643
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
It's going to be that simple.

644
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
So I won't have to explain it within 10 seconds.

645
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
It's like, can you explain Tvo?

646
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
No.

647
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
I mean, yeah, you can to people who understand the now.

648
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,920
But if someone was never seen Tvo before, go ahead and explain it.

649
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
You don't have to.

650
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,920
You just give it to them and you show them the buttons and they get it.

651
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,920
So it's going to be that simple to create your own program experience.

652
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,920
You know, it's just a matter of dragging shit into a box and clicking it to put it onto your iPod.

653
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,920
So we have the concept of get it, which is you get stuff that you want to put into your channel.

654
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,920
So it's shows or single episodes.

655
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
It can be a lot more things, by the way.

656
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,920
For those of you who are adventurous, just try putting a PDF file in your feed.

657
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,920
See what happens in the dashboard.

658
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Then there's the concept of putting your channel somewhere.

659
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
So you want to put it onto your iPod.

660
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
You want to put it into Windows Media Player.

661
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,920
So it's going to be get and it's going to be put.

662
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Yeah.

663
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
I don't know if it's Jerry Allen's going to be awesome podcast.

664
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
Let's go on.

665
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
Hey, I got a few comments.

666
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
I haven't been checking out each channel.

667
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I'm just battling a little more in that.

668
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,920
And also, so I am doing a little bit of homework still.

669
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Still not really jive.

670
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,920
And I think it's because to be very honest with you, I don't listen to podcasts on my computer

671
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,920
because I'm always on the go.

672
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,920
So I do have to make use of it with the channels, even though I know that I can't place that on my iPod.

673
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
But that's for another time.

674
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Anyway, so I wanted to address the nylon.

675
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,920
So it's going to be the same for you, dude.

676
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Don't worry about it.

677
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
It's going to be one click.

678
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Oh, okay.

679
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
I get it.

680
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
There's a channel.

681
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,920
So what I'll do is I'll put a link in the show notes today to the Tour de France channel.

682
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
I'll put an RSS.

683
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I'll put a link into the channel page.

684
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I'll put a link to the RSS feed.

685
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
And I'll put an iTunes link.

686
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Oh, man.

687
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
I won't be in bed until like 1 am.

688
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,920
And then, probably in the commentary strip blogger.

689
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Well, there's been this people.

690
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Nothing.

691
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Just don't come across as the most positive people, especially this nylon guy.

692
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
His theme song.

693
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,920
I think it says he's from New York, but now lives in London.

694
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
He's an expatriate.

695
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
He doesn't want to.

696
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
I can't really understand the addiction of those singers.

697
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,920
But I can tell you that he seems like a majorly asshole.

698
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,920
And anytime that he would like to get a little bit of his aggression out there,

699
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,920
just let me know because I've got a K2 and Vegas waiting on him.

700
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
That's right.

701
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
You're the ultimate fighting.

702
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Of course.

703
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,920
I can carry out Alexander.

704
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Oh, and I almost forgot.

705
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Constra blogger.

706
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I would like to just literally direct this comment to you personally.

707
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,920
How dare you insult the founding fathers?

708
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
You guys came all the way from England.

709
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
And all just, you know, to come over here and eat, like,

710
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
corn from the Indian.

711
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
I'm part of American Indian and Scottish as well.

712
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,920
I think they had more than they had corn and turkey and cranberry sauce.

713
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Yeah, that's what they had.

714
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,920
And also, we'd like to see an invitation for you to hear every in Vegas.

715
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
And a case for a case for you.

716
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Come on over to the House of Champions, Jim.

717
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,920
And I've got a pair of gloves.

718
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,920
You can strap on and get a little bit of your aggression out.

719
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
You can leave your strap on and all.

720
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
We have some bags you can hit.

721
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Or if you would really like to get it aggressive and interesting.

722
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
I'll step in the cage with you.

723
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,920
So you can come into my world if you like.

724
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
I'll fill in.

725
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,920
I will try to learn more about the Nokia services from you.

726
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,920
I am between your annoying bullshit ramps.

727
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,920
I'll get there.

728
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,920
Yeah, there's a fight I'd promote.

729
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Come extra blogger in an old drawn out.

730
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Drop down to the last man standing fight against the nylon with tag team.

731
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Gary Alexander from the ultimate podcast.

732
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Yeah, sorry.

733
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
I just took me.

734
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
I had a moment there.

735
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I imagined a soccer girl walking around with the, with the round signs.

736
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
It was a little bit of a moment.

737
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I had an assistance.

738
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:54,920
I said to you I go your comment about my perfect podcasting player.

739
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,920
I know that you added it.

740
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I know that's where he now.

741
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I got to do.

742
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
It was it was way too long.

743
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
But I appreciate it.

744
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
It was just too.

745
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
I don't want to bore people with death.

746
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I'm already boring people with a fricking channel talk.

747
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,920
But you know, I got to ran this on everyone's throat before.

748
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
or I can actually let you play with it.

749
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,760
But this comments about Congress and email or writing to your congressman, and of course

750
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,960
I have to watch and sickle, which I recommend, I get kind of angry, so I want to open

751
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,440
congress.org, and that's a site that allows you to keep track of your congress

752
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:39,600
critter by RSSB, so every single table, everything they abstain, every bill they put

753
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,720
for, you can get a feed for, you put in here, various representatives and senators.

754
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,360
And you can also subscribe to various issues like, I subscribe to the healthcare issue.

755
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,080
At the time, there's a healthcare bill that shows up and I get to see what's happening on

756
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
that.

757
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:04,040
And the compliment that I bookmarked all the contact pages for my representatives and my area

758
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,320
and my two senators, so I can email them and yell them whatever they do, something

759
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,320
good, or I mean do some bad, or praise them when they do something good, like a proper

760
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,440
constituent should, so check that out, open congress.org, and good times, please.

761
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,680
Thank you so much, that's an excellent tip, and I checked out that site and I am all over,

762
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,200
I love it, that's really, really awesome.

763
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,560
And it's how we use our power, believe me, you can sit around and blog all you want, but

764
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,960
if you just threaten the people in congress, and it's that simple, just use the same

765
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,480
contacts, everybody else says.

766
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,480
And all you have to say is, I want you to vote this way, if you want to, you can back

767
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,000
it up with some supporting material and just say, if you don't, I'm not going to vote

768
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
for you.

769
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
It's that simple, you'll lose my vote, and this is important to me, I don't care whether

770
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
you agree with it or not, that's where I stand, don't push you foot around it, just

771
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
make it real simple.

772
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,240
I think that makes, that's just the easiest way to do it.

773
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,720
Okay, this kind of goes back to the side of the spectacle, because you know everything

774
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,960
is dangerous, my friends.

775
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,560
Your kid can get salmonella from his new cat turtle, buckle your seat belt or through

776
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:18,280
the windshield you will hurt him, you can choke on anything, not bigger than your head.

777
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,040
Everything is dangerous, so how come you're not dead?

778
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,360
You might poke your eye out with any given soil, you might die from allergies to peanuts

779
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:34,280
weed or soil, all these deadly circumstances we cannot improve.

780
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,960
Everything is dangerous, so please try not to move.

781
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,040
Terrorists are everywhere in every school and all, and it might be better if you don't

782
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,120
touch, she's at all, all the other drivers aren't saying that they've got guns, don't

783
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,200
pick up your chikers, even if they're dressed as nuns, your date has GHB, he hopes tomorrow

784
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:17,640
we'll forget him, everything is dangerous, so go ahead and wet him.

785
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,680
Dihydrogen monoxide will surely spell your doom, it might just be easier if you don't leave

786
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,560
the room, make sure that your sunscreen is at least SPF 30, don't eat food in restaurants,

787
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,840
the chef's hands might be dirty, game and want your body and they can't control their

788
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:42,600
urges, monks have secret messages, they're chanting in their urges, magnetic waves

789
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,200
from in your cell phone just my fry a brain, there's a flying spaghetti monster in your

790
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:55,640
beach I'll main, there is hilton and night explode, I saw it on Fox News, everything is dangerous,

791
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,920
including Stobber's shoes, keep yourself hydrated or you'll pass out from the heat,

792
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:08,760
watch out for wormhole or banana beneath your feet, motor cyclists with tattoos just got out of the

793
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,240
joint, homeless people have diseases, so don't stare at point, from the moment that you're

794
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,800
born until the day you die, everything might kill you and a lot of things will try,

795
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,920
so you've got two choices and their easy to compare, everything is dangerous or everything's just

796
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,040
there, everything is dangerous, so suck it up my friend. Tom Smith, everything is dangerous,

797
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,240
fantastic, it really sums up this episode out, it's a nice little package, put about it,

798
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,120
bow around it, this thing is done, so you know what, take the rest of the afternoon off, go have

799
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,200
sex, if you don't have anyone to go have sex with, have a wink, I'll see you tomorrow,

800
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,040
another pod show podcast, stick it in your ear,

801
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,280
the best in the brightest, subdupped daily by the sharpest minds in content delivering pod show and

802
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:15,860
live light.
