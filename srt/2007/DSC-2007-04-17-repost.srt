00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Padshal's poet laureate Melvin P. LeBeth.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Roses are wed, my sweater is beige. For your domain name needs, you should go to this page. GoDaddy.com.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Time for an extra special bonus! That's right, because I'm a passionate guy like that.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So as a sit here, touching myself, I thought to myself, I should call Mark. I should tell Mark,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
do you love what you're doing with a chacha? The chacha has never been so fresh, so invigorating.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, um, turning it on. I sit here every night and the doctor said it's my homework.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I put the iPod into my ears. I grab the Vaseline and I turn off the lights and I crank up the chacha with Mark.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You'll show more on him, cough. It makes me happy. It makes me giddy. It makes a mess of my sheets and my socks, but that's okay.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you, Mark. Keep up the good work.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
First, there was brain twisting, jallin jipper, together, the principles of mathematics and cross-all puzzles.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
From Japan, the country that brought you suitable.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come! Bookaku!

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right, let's see, seven, one. The four goes here. Wait, no damn, that's not right.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Holy shit, dude, you just jacked off on me.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm like regular Sudoku, where you can make mistakes and erase them with pencil.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Bookaku is much more challenging, because if you get even one number wrong, you will find you and jack off on you.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh my eye!

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bookaku is fun for parties, national parties, retirement parties, and the occasion in perfect time for Bookaku.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Today, Little Schmolikko, Bergonia 13, birthday you are a man.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My Little Schmolik, somebody get a towel.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Idiot, days no 13, in Bookaku!

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Get Bookaku today! Before Bookaku, get you!

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Bookaku!

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're listening to the daily source code with Mark Yoshimoto Nenkov.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends, coming to you from Gilford, somewhere deep in the bowels of the UK.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And the bowels are pretty deep here.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, guess what, it's me again, and I'm here at Adam's house, where something in the attic smells like corn chips and feet, and Adam is still unconscious.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're listening to episode 5-8-2 of the Chacha.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Tell you what, let's start it all off with some really kick-ass shit from Kevin Reeves.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now I'm on my way.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So many dusty roads have run down.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Switching for this place, without a chance of miles and face the trials.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No matter what it takes, gotta try.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Before I die, gotta fade.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The love I'm searching for, so leave it away.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The things that make me feel so lost in play.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now I'm feeling I'm running out of time.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not going to work.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is this?

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You've never keep a damn.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, good boys, the gun recovers, gonna glued out on the land.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I saw the road ahead of my own.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I feel so handsome around, but all I've found were just sections born and new

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm so tall

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, I'm so tall

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's now I know

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't think it will with me when I go

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now I'm the rethink what I saw

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll get my life up there in tensions

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now this is my journey for protection

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, I'm so handsome around, but all I've found were just sections born and new

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm so tall

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's now I know

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't think it will with me when I go

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now this is my journey for protection

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now this is my journey for protection

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, I can't think it will with me when I go

58
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now I'm the rethink what I saw

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll get my life up there in tensions

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now this is my journey for protection

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, I'm so handsome around, but all I've found were just sections born and new

62
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm so handsome around, but all I've found were just sections born and new

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Kevin Reeves with redemption, fuck yeah man, that's on rocks like a mother fucker

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So hey, welcome to the daily source code, I'm Mark Yoshimoto Nemkoff

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know what, I'm declaring today, Bong hit Tuesday

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I found some Adam's stash here at the manner and I'm a dude

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is some Primo Primo shit, hold on

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh fuck, oh my god

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That should make Willie Nelson blind, oh my god

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have no idea where he gets it from, but so today, yeah today is, I got to do another one hold on

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh shit

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, so today is Bong hit Tuesday

73
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And, oh fuck man, so if you're in your car, if you're on the subway, I don't care

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fucking, I pull out that Bong, I want everybody doing Bong hits right now

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Even, yeah, okay

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, right, right, right, so Adam, right, right

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So yeah, yeah, I was going through his underwear drawer

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And it's all thongs, it is, it's all thongs

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And thongs and bolo ties, I swear to god

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So I'm going through Adam's underwear drawer

81
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I find his stash, this beautiful, beautiful stash of, well, I found that stash too

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But we'll talk about that later

83
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But I also found I swear to god, you got to see this, it's the most amazing thing

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's, basically, I found his show formula

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is one of the most highly guarded secrets in all of podcasting

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The recipe for the daily source code that he kept hidden in his underwear drawer

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right underneath that turtle shape vibrator that was signed by Kurt Loader

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know if it was actual signature because the turtle face on the vibrator actually looks like Kurt Loader

89
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Anyway, so this is the recipe for the daily source code

90
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Item number one, play series of repetitive opening jingles in order to get those last 20 drags in on the blunt

91
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Number two, for five minutes line about my internet connection in my new house

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm be sure to give specific details on download and upload data rates

93
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Number three, spend 10 minutes delivering soliloquy on geopolitical landscape

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And partying opinions and expertise gained from years spent introducing the latest music video from CNC music factory

95
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Number four, playback message from multi-lingual vampire from the EU

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Number five, fantasize about girls would call into the show

97
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Number six, play cold pod save song

98
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Number seven, ruin cold pod save song with cowbell and or singing

99
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Number eight, flick lighter, set man or on fire

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, yeah, I think this is all going to be useful shit

101
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So, hold on let me ask Adam what do you think

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dude chill, okay chill, alright look you want you want to bang it

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Dude, you're going to whip the duct tape come on, dude

104
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Fuck hold on

105
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh fuck, I think I set the cattle prod too high

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh man, he's probably going to crap himself now, odd cheese

107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I thought that you said about piracy and the statistical information about the boss

108
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It may be thick about the whole concept of being born to run

109
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If I had an endless word to have phrasing, let tell the format

110
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I truly wrap your legs around these velvet ribs and strap your hands across my inches

111
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Is that what you had in mind when you mentioned that M's could stay

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well anyway, just some thoughts to ponder

113
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Goodbye, Mr. Namca

114
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, and please still Adam, I put the victory set me on the medicine chest right over the Tylenol PM

115
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bro, I think pro grammar at your command is the melodic pro grammar program

116
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh man, that is oh fuck, what the fuck is that in there?

117
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, it's like kitty litter

118
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh shit

119
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh my god, I think he's lacing his stuff with cat shit

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh my god, oh, I don't care whatever it is man

121
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Anyway, so

122
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So I know Adam hasn't really talked about second life a whole lot lately

123
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But you know, kind of got me involved in it and I think a lot of you too

124
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And something that's actually happening in second life

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
CC Chapman sent me a press release his company crayon

126
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They're this cutting edge marketing company and check this out. They're working with Coca-Cola

127
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So let me read this press release Coca-Cola launches competition to design online

128
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Virtual first Coke machine open competition invites in world second life residents and the public

129
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
To imagine a virtual vending machine with a limitless possibilities

130
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Check this out check this out

131
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Imagine a vending machine that dispenses entertainment adventure or happiness

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A device that satisfies curiosities and fulfills virtual wishes

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Coca-Cola is launching an open contest for second life residents and the general population

134
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
To design a virtual experience machine through its virtual thirst competition second life is a three-dimensional online digital world

135
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That enables user residents to explore digital universe and blow lives, you know what second life is

136
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So let me hold on

137
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Uh, scan up

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But simply we've invited the world to use the second life platform to design and prototype the ultimate Coke machine

139
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Something that delivers an innovative engaging experience in second life as defined by its community of residents

140
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Says Michael Donnelly director global marketing global interactive marketing Coca-Cola company

141
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So for example, I guess it could play music from a jukebox or display fun animation in video

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Or transform the user's experience and capabilities in some positive way

143
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So that's pretty fucking cool

144
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So you design this virtual vending machine right that can dispense

145
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Um entertainment and Coke and whatever right I mean it's totally outside the box kind of thinking

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And it's not about second life, right?

147
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's it's about imagination and the thing is you could submit apparently you could submit your submission

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Man, that's it. I'm smoking is way too fucked up. You could submit your submission. Yeah, good job

149
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So you could submit your prototype

150
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Um, you know, either through audio a video or whatever

151
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So it says right here go to virtualthirst.com

152
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's pretty fucking cool. Now

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know about you

154
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But my my idea for the perfect Coke vending machine involves you know

155
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I put in my dollar. I get a ice cold coke, you know chilled perfectly and I get a blowjob

156
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Now, you know the machine doesn't have to give me a blowjob

157
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I mean there could you know be a someone there hopefully a pretty young girl

158
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I

159
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm not picky though if I'm getting a blowjob for a box and you know

160
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Who am I to pick and choose but that's kind of the concept so you could design your coke vending machine

161
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you want your coke vending machine to you know

162
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Dispense coke and play music and and spread sunshine and happiness across the globe

163
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Then you're kind of fucked in the head, but no, no, you know what I'm saying

164
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then it's it's a great idea. It's a grand idea

165
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You know, I'm definitely going to enter my a blowjob coke machine prototype though

166
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So I way I can go in second life when they prototype the thing and I can stand there with my avatar and get blown in drink of virtual coke

167
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think that'd be fucking awesome. That sounds like Saturday afternoon to me

168
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And I'm doing this my online avatar and second life

169
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Doesn't have a dick

170
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, because barely you have to buy a fucking cock for your online avatar

171
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There are shops in second life. I swear to God. I didn't know this right and

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,500
True story when Brittany Mason was showing me around the town of Shadow Falls what when they built the town of Shadow Falls

173
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
We did that whole thing

174
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
She was showing me a bunch of other places in second life and I was I was really like amazed by

175
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How creative people got with their buildings and their little islands and stuff

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And she took me as a place and it was actually a pretty big ad agency that had a office in second life

177
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And so I was running around naked. I just I hit the button that said take my clothes

178
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm running around naked and you know and she said you got no dick

179
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And I was like, oh check that out. She's like, I'll buy you a dick

180
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And I felt kind of weird. I felt a little weird having a strange online woman buy me a penis

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't know maybe something I just have to get over

182
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But I know one way to make my inhibitions go away hold on

183
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's definitely catch it. Oh fuck

184
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Common strip

185
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000

Common strip

187
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is a club called the man bar and eighty two great suffix street in London

188

WWE dot man bar dot info

189
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They do have a good two for one decorate night on Tuesday

190
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But I do not want to meet Adam's hair

191
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Anyway, Markio Shomodonemka fuck you

192
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I have to go now and pop a hemorrhoid

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Not one of my own, but this none of your business

194
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Common strip

Common strip

197
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hey Mark, I've got some feedback for you

198
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When you started talking about the RIA it really got my blood boiling

199
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because here's the deal

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The RIA can win and moan all the wants

201
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But reality is it and the companies represents our scared shitless

202
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They are falling way behind as they stick to their old models of production and distribution

203
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Sort of like how Adam's remote control sticks to his inner thigh

204
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think you understand me

205
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Point is before the internet sharing was negligible

206
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And even then it's still encouraged people to go to concerts and buy merchandise

207
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Of course this is still happening

208
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But back then big labels had the power to produce very few acts and promote them excessively

209
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Because we only had so many ways of accessing media

210
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
In fact, they would sign good artists and then bury them in the vaults

211
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In order to protect their big cash running acts

212
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This model is fucking dying

213
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The internet has retribulized the world

214
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And people are getting sick and tired of the same shit on the radio

215
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And on the Rax and ATMP

216
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Or whatever other shitty records store this, drop it

217
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The labels are convinced that they have to keep a few huge acts and earn all their cash from them

218
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And as since they are creating the piracy that they claim is hurting them

219
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
By over saturating us, the listeners

220
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I mean, do we really need another Britney Spears album?

221
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We have no choice but to pirate

222
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If the labels would pull their heads out of their asses

223
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And promote a wide variety of good artists

224
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It would dilute musical tastes across the board

225
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This would make piracy irrelevant

226
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because the labels would need the social aspect of the internet

227
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
To get the word out on their artists

228
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is what the positive music network is doing

229
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And if the labels don't get their shit together

230
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They're going to get their asses kicked

231
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I for one would love to see that

232
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, and by the way, I hope you remember to poke some holes in the closet

233
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Or something so that Adam can breathe

234
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Take care

235
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hold on, hold on

236
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Fuck you

237
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Travis, thank you

238
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Travis Martin

239
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
With that comment, thanks Travis

240
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And thank you for reminding me to actually throw some holes in the door here

241
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You gotta hope it's not too late

242
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Anyway, you know what Travis, you have a really good point

243
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The record companies, I've friend to work in the music business

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Over the last five years

245
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So many people who work at record companies

246
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You know, we're talking suits and our guys

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Whoever have lost their fucking jobs

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Because these record companies are failing to make money

249
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And they blame it all on piracy

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But one of the things that has always struck me as being fucking ironic

251
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Is that throughout the history of maybe the last what?

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
20, 30 years

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The record industry

254
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Has spent a fortune

255
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Baddling piracy

256
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Whether it's a battling real-to-real tape

257
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Or cassette

258
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Or dat

259
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
When dat recorders came out

260
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Which was the first actual consumer model

261
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Digital audio recording medium

262
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When dat recorders came out

263
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The record companies

264
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The RAA

265
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Went fucking insane

266
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Spending a fortune

267
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And having hearings

268
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So that they could enforce

269
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What was I think was what was it called at the time

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
DCMS or whatever digital copy management system

271
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So you could not actually hook up a CD player

272
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The optical output of a CD player to a

273
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Consumer level dat machine

274
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And make a perfect digital copy

275
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They spend millions of dollars

276
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We'll fuck do you think those millions of dollars came from

277
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's right

278
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They came from artist royalties

279
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So instead of taking the money

280
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That they were making from the artists

281
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And putting it back

282
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Into the business

283
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
To invest in new artists

284
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Or even fucking pay their artist what they're actually worth

285
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They took this money

286
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And they've been doing this

287
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
They took this money to fight piracy

288
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But they've done the same thing with cassettes

289
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
With CD recorders with anything

290
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I mean you look at the history

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
They've spent a fortune on this

292
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And then every few years or so

293
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Another medium comes out

294
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Another way to copy music comes out

295
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And then they spend another fortune going to fight that

296
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's just the way it has been

297
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Since the fucking invention of any sort of home recording

298
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Right

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And you know who's fault this fucking is

300
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll tell you

301
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's the fucking lawyers

302
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Because some lawyer basically says

303
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey, you know what we need to fight this

304
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And they find a way that their firm

305
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Can make millions of dollars

306
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And I'll tell you why that's not bullshit

307
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Going back like five years

308
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Actually more than that

309
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Going back a few years

310
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I had a literary manager here in Hollywood

311
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
His name is Daniel Alter

312
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And Daniel told me the story one day that his lawyer

313
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Was the same lawyer who handles Metallica

314
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And basically the lawyer went to Metallica one day

315
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
With this whole story about what was going on

316
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
With this company called Napster

317
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And the lawyer said to Metallica, hey look what's going on

318
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I think we have a way here that we can make millions of dollars

319
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That is exactly what happened

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I am not fucking making this up

321
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The idea to sue Napster was not Metallica

322
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It was their fucking lawyers idea

323
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh shit hold on serious 102 listeners

324
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You're going to have to go to dailysourceco.podshow.com

325
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
To download the rest of the podcast

326
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And hear me say fuck a bunch more times

327
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Catch you later

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay

329
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So yeah, the whole thing

330
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Was cooked up by a fucking lawyer

331
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And I'm sure it's the same thing

332
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
At the record companies

333
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
With how the RAAA manages to

334
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You know spend their fucking money

335
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Badling piracy

336
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Now

337
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Granted

338
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
If you go to a record company

339
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
A lot of times a lot of the suits there

340
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Are lawyers

341
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because they come up in the entertainment ranks

342
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They know the business

343
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They know the finances blah blah bullshit

344
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Whatever

345
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
A lot of the suits at any major record company

346
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The major suits

347
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
We're talking the guys who run the fucking business

348
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They're all fucking lawyers

349
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'll tell you what with the exception

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Of this fucking douchebag

351
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That runs the universal music group

352
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This fucking Doug Morris guy

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Now remember this is the guy that called

354
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
All iPod users

355
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Pirate

356
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And we said all iPods

357
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Are full of pirated music

358
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You know that Doug Morris guy

359
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Doug

360
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Doug Morris

361
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You music.com

362
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That Doug Morris guy

363
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Who I think is the biggest fucking scumbag

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
In the music industry

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Doug Morris

366
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If you can hear me

367
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Fucking blow me you fucking piece of shit

368
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You know what

369
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I swear to God

370
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's like

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The fucking bullshit

372
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That the universal music group has perpetrated

373
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
On their artists

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Their listeners

375
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Is a fucking sin

376
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And here's a guy who started his fucking career as a songwriter

377
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And this guy doesn't give a fuck about the artist on his label

378
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Again, here's a fucking company

379
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That is spending countless millions of dollars

380
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Fucking fighting piracy

381
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Right?

382
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You know they're trying to eliminate all their videos

383
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Off YouTube and all that

384
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean come on

385
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Do you honestly think that anybody

386
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Is fucking copying the audio

387
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
From the video on YouTube

388
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And listening to it on their MP3 player

389
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I mean a video

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
A music video

391
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They're all created as a fucking commercial for the song

392
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Right?

393
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Remember MTV when they used to fucking play videos

394
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Right?

395
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What do you think all that content was?

396
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
This is freebie shit

397
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
MTV was not paying

398
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
To fucking play these videos

399
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So in the same way

400
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's like how is how is YouTube

401
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Showing these videos

402
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Anything other than a

403
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know a way to market this shit

404
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That otherwise people would never see it

405
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What the fuck is the difference?

406
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't get it

407
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay, maybe I'm missing something

408
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Maybe I'm fucking taking too many bong hits

409
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And I just don't fucking get it

410
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But anyway

411
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And the other thing Travis, I think you totally nailed

412
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Is that

413
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You have these record companies

414
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And same thing with the movie industry

415
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Or the book industry or whatever

416
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They rely on a blockbuster release

417
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
To fucking pay for everything else on their slate

418
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That doesn't do so well

419
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And when you get into that kind of mentality

420
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Where you rely on the blockbuster

421
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Then you are going to go after it

422
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The easy fucking sell bullshit

423
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And you're eventually going to say

424
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You know what?

425
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It makes more sense

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
To fucking promote

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You know 10 Britney Spears clones

428
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That we know all

429
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You know sell a few hundred thousand units

430
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Then trying to promote new artists

431
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That may only sell 30, 40, 50,000 units

432
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Their first time out

433
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You know nobody wants to develop a new artist anymore

434
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
In the same way that media

435
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
A television, especially

436
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Doesn't want to give a television show

437
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Any sort of chance to build an audience

438
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you don't fucking build an audience right away

439
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're gone

440
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And that is exactly

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
The kind of fucking mentality

442
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That is going to fuck the record industry

443
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Right in the ass

444
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Unless they're into that kind of thing

445
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And then

446
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You're regardless

447
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The mentality of the record industry

448
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Has always been to protect

449
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What they fucking currently have

450
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And not evolve

451
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Which is why they're fucking dying

452
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Which is why the record industry

453
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Is fucking hemorrhaging right now

454
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And they sit around

455
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And they have no fucking idea

456
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What to do?

457
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's it's sad and pathetic

458
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So here we go

459
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Record industry

460
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm going to tell you what to do

461
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
First thing you do

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's called a PCH comment line

463
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
At 1-800-875-099-5

464
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And I'll set your shit straight

465
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Because the new methods of distribution over the internet

466
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Are slaying the record companies

467
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And what you're going to see is that

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
As record companies

469
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Have fewer

470
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Resources for distribution

471
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
They're going to rely on

472
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Basically they're the top few distribution outlets they have

473
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And of course

474
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You know what scares the fuck out of me

475
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Is the number one distribution outlet for music in the United States

476
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The number one distributor of music

477
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Wal-Mart

478
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Wal-Mart

479
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Conservative fucking Wal-Mart

480
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay Wal-Mart who basically says

481
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh no we want to distribute that because it's

482
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's too controversial

483
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Okay

484
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So Wal-Mart

485
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Sounds more records than anybody else in the United States

486
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So what you're going to see are fewer choices on the racks

487
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And as a result

488
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The record industry is going to have to rely on

489
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
More and more blockbuster hits

490
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And when they don't have them

491
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Because their audiences are being drawn away

492
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
By more and more choices

493
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Guess what's going to fucking happen

494
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So I feel like Nikita Kruzchev banging my fucking shoe on the podium

495
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You know we will fucking bury you

496
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But guess what record companies

497
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
RIA

498
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
We're going to bury your mother fucking asses

499
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And it's going to be fun to watch

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Hey questions comments

501
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Let me know

502
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Send me an email

503
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
At where is Adam Curry at gmail.com

504
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Or you can send one to Adam Curry's gay

505
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
At gmail.com

506
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Mark Yosin Mode and NMK

507
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well my god

508
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I was being a daily source code

509
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Look now

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I thought the point of this whole Adam going away

511
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Saying was to reduce the almost factor on the DSC

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Well anyway

513
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I guess he'll do

514
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's go on on man

515
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Then that is what I'm going to do

516
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Let me show you

517
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Nice little surprise

518
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Kind of the DSC this morning

519
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And find you co hosting at door

520
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Substitute hosting at home

521
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Anyway

522
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Calling in regards to your RIA

523
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Major record label

524
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Inquiry

525
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Pun intended of course

526
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Anyway

527
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It seems to me like

528
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Although we end up talking about this in great detail

529
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
These should seem to be becoming

530
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
More and more muddy

531
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
As time goes on

532
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And here's a deal

533
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
As you know

534
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Because you want to create this for the show

535
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Talking about

536
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Major record labels with me not so long ago

537
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Or some major record labels are screwed anyway

538
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Anyway

539
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Anyway

540
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It seems like there are two components of this

541
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The date although they are not defined

542
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
One is a legalistic component

543
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The second is a moralistic component

544
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And more realistic component comes from

545
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The legalistic end

546
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That is to say that

547
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
This technique is technically illegal

548
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
To quote unquote pirate music

549
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
However

550
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And the RIAs

551
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Justifications seem to come from

552
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
While this is illegal

553
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Therefore we have the right to do

554
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
X, Y, and Z

555
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
They're being resisted

556
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
However because of the moralistic end

557
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Which comes from the legalistic end

558
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Although it is technically illegal

559
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It is due in part to the lobbying

560
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Of the government

561
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We are a double way

562
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
These people have much more leverage money

563
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And power

564
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Than the other side

565
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Being the end user

566
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The consumer

567
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
New and me and all the other cool people

568
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Actually pay for music

569
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And

570
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Dan

571
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Dan

572
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Where'd you go?

573
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Dan Patterson cut off there

574
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't know

575
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm thinking he might have been silenced

576
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
By the RIA

577
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He knew too much

578
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
They had to keep him quiet

579
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Dan Patterson

580
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Are you on the bonnet Tuesday?

581
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
On the daily cold sore

582
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah

583
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And

584
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Oh we got another comment

585
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Hold on

586
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Similar to Adam Roger here

587
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I was going to be in the Guilford

588
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I was wandering by the

589
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Curry Cottage

590
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And I was wondering if I could stop

591
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
In for a

592
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Jolly Good Rogering today

593
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Anyway

594
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Goodbye

595
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Fuck I don't have Roger Smalls

596
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Is a jingle

597
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Here I can't find it on Adam's

598
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Laptop

599
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Hold on

600
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
No

601
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I can't find it

602
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So I don't know

603
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't even remember how

604
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
How's it go?

605
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Roger Smalls

606
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Roger Smalls

607
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You really creepy guy

608
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You want to lick Adam's balls

609
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't know

610
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Something like that

611
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
What I did find on this laptop

612
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh my god

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000

In Adam's attic there

629
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Causing too much trouble

630
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Inviting the Guils around

631
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I hope

He just he

662
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,240
getting any of the things and you just can't pump it out, oh it's crazy. Anyway this is

663
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,320
Derek from Sydney Australia and if you remember that jingle from last year that's the

664
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,880
potty for cancer jingle and you know we're getting excited again because May is when we're

665
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,720
having the world's biggest morning tea. What it is is we're raising money for cancer and it's

666
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,040
it's been, it's been affected by this lately and it's just crazy that like people should

667
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,720
be able to get on with their lives and do pot casting and anything they want with having to

668
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,280
bother with some crazy disease so we're donating money to cure it basically and well not

669
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,200
basically we're going to cure it it's going to be great the day we see it on the front page

670
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,400
on the newspaper but at the moment we're just donating money for the research so you can donate

671
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,840

685
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,520
some really cool shit in Australia. Hey real quick before we go on to talk about one last thing

686
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,680
do you know what a stumble squad is? I learned this from Chris Penn from the Financial Aid podcast

687
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,440
Chris Penn evil genius Chris Penn and I don't know if you've hooked up with stumble upon

688
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,800
at stumble upon.com it's a really cool way to actually find new websites you kind of put this thing

689
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,280
in a toolbar of your browser and you click on it it just kind of randomly kicks out a website based

690
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,080
upon you know your preferences the things that you like so if you click that you like

691
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:56,200
books or movies or fisting boom it'll click out a website based upon like something that you're

692
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,240
interested in and you know basically you give it thumbs up thumbs down whatever or give it a review

693
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,800
you know that kind of thing but it's a really it's an amazing marketing tool as well because what

694
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:16,440
you do is if you are inclined to right you get a bunch of friends together and you help each other out

695
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,640
like if somebody says hey check out my page and give it a thumbs up then you know apparently the more

696
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,360
thumbs up response is something gets the more frequently it's delivered to anybody who clicks on

697
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:34,680
the stumble upon button in their toolbar so check it out stumble upon.com and I was thinking you

698
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,240
don't be amazing we should create a big stumble squad and all help each other out promoting

699
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,160
you know our shows or stuff or anything crazy you're doing on the web so I don't know

700
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,000
shoot me an email fuck maybe I'm just some kind of crazy optimist maybe maybe it's the shit in

701
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,160
Adam's Bung I swear to God this stuff is amazing hold on one more

702
