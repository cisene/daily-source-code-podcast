1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:26,020
Yeah, everybody. It's the Daily Source Code. I'm Adam Curry and I'm trying out some new

2
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,160
software today for the, what the heck was called, the show. First of all, let me

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:43,160
dog into the studio here. Come on, Jess. Come on. Because the dog wants to go outside. So I had put out a request for

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:52,160
software that I could actually do these recordings with and plenty of suggestions. Nothing exactly what I wanted.

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:03,160
One, a couple for GarageBand, which I did like. I did try out. And you know, you really can't do the live mix and

6
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
starting stuff in.

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
in starting songs and maybe sound effects or audio bits.

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,020
If it's a timeline based recorder editor,

9
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,820
you really need just a couple of buttons

10
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,420
that you can assign to sound files.

11
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,180
You have to be able to hit them

12
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,420
and the output needs to be combined

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,660
with the microphone channel into an MP3 file.

14
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,060
What I did like about GarageBand though

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,220
was the great effects and the preset effects

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,380
that I could use on the microphone.

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,500
Really sound good as opposed to this crappy sound

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,020
that I have now.

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,220
And I'm gonna explain a second what I'm using.

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,500
Hold on a second.

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,540
Dogs back in, would like to leave.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,880
explain. There's a, what I call the studio is a bar in one far end of the house and there's a

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:05,040
door open here that goes out into the back patio and into the grounds and Jesse, our biggest dog,

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,560
knows that that's a quick way out. All right, other suggestions were Audion,

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,200
which again, you know, you can, that'll let you record an MP3 mix down, a playlist of songs

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
mixed together, which you could talk over, which isn't quite what I'm looking for. Acoustica,

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,440
which is something that Dave posts on his site as a recommendation. Again, that's not what you're

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,640
looking for when we're doing this kind of stuff. That's a timeline based recorder and editor,

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,840
although great for pre-recording stuff and it's not really good for the live environment.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,320
And then it hit me that really, there's so many different

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Um

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,820
Um...

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,780
applications that I use for different real-for-sound.

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:04,720
I may use iTunes for one reason, perhaps for some of the digital signal processing features.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,420
I may just use a quick time player and other instances.

36
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,780
I can create the mix on my speakers almost, because I have a program that will record

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
my voice.

38
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:25,140
Maybe what I'm looking for is just a very small application that will actually record

39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,020
a mic in channel or line in channel, a microphone channel, and then anything else that's on

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
the speakers.

41
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Anything.

42
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
There's got to be a way to hook into that somehow and the poor audio or whatever it

43
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,060
is on the Macintosh.

44
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,820
Anyway, I finally wound up using Studio 365 Live.

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,980
I'm going to put a screenshot of it on my web log at live.curry.com.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,880
hum because that interface really shows what I'm talking about and it's really really

47
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,740
simple. There's a playlist window where you can put songs that will play in order or

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,920
that's where I just store the song of the day. There's two what they call cart machines

49
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,240
and you can load up an mp3 in that and hit a button that starts immediately and then

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
there's a mic channel that you click on or off and you can set your levels and that's

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,080
basically it. The downside here is that I'm also pooping out 64 kilobits a second of

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,080
whatever to live 365 server which they've already sent over 2 megabytes but it does

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,880
let you record a copy of the output that you're sending up to their server as an mp3

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,720
on your desktop. So that's how I'm doing it today and that's what gives me the opportunity

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,920
to play the song of the day which is something that's just perfect for a Sunday afternoon here

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,480
in Belgium. It's sunny and the temperature's nice.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,220
cool maybe for the summer but it just kind of gives you this type of vibe. You just want

58
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,500
to hear a little bit of the small things.

59
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm gonna bring your sides to rest my eyes and shade to bring. I'm gonna dream in space.

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:22,500
To each of you, go back, let's play. What did you do there? What did you feel there?

61
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:37,500
It's true, it's not the key is there. It's hard to but it's hard, it's hard to but it's hard

62
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:54,500
to but it's hard to but it's hard to but it's hard to but it's hard to but it's hard to but it's hard

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I tell you what I do, I like to go there, I'll review you, you can miss out school, what's that?

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why go to learn the world of that world?

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's all too beautiful to be playing, but you know my mind, it's not enough for me to play slow about my mind.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They all corrupt, you're not the one which my center path is free.

67
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:14,920
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful.

68
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:25,500
It's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful, it's all too beautiful.

69
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Well it's all too beautiful. It's your good part. Small faces. Look at this. Apparently,

70
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:54,360
the playlist is on repeat. Okay, so again, it's all about the interface in this case,

71
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,800
and a couple of other items in the news. I just want to talk about briefly. One is that

72
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:07,640
I woke up this morning and the Dutch teletext, which is kind of like a newspaper on your

73
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,480
TV. It's kind of like web pages. They all have a number and the signal is sent along

74
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,720
with the television signal and it's decoded. So you can actually just read text on your

75
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:26,880
television, hence the name teletext, that in Arumaita in Iraq, which is in the southwestern

76
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,520
region where the Dutch troops are stationed.

77
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,500
that last night one soldier was killed, four were seriously wounded.

78
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,500
And the Folkskrant, which is one of the larger newspapers here,

79
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,500
the very left wing, was the only one online with the story,

80
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
see around 8 o'clock this morning.

81
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,500
And for hours, and I haven't checked just recently now,

82
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
it's at three in the afternoon, you know, there was nothing on CNN.com

83
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
or AP or Reuters, there was just nothing about it.

84
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,500
And as a part of the coalition, you know, whether I agree with us being there or not,

85
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,500
that sucked, you know, it's like, hey, come on, aren't we a part of the whole global group here or what?

86
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,500
And it also really hit home because I've been to that camp where this happened.

87
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,500
So, and I do remember of all the trips we took, we all collectively actually felt that we were

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
most unsafe there and we actually did most of the walking there at the time and crossed

89
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:43,520
a platoon bridge. I believe that was all in out of my town. And yeah, it was kind of shocking.

90
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:54,960
It brings it all back. And what's going on in Texas? The sixth person this year to die from the

91
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,960
flesh-eating bacteria. This is, you know, this is worrisome. See, this guy was pretty young too.

92
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:11,120
I think I was like 52 years old. Let me see. Of course now I almost have no bandwidth left to

93
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,760
surf to stuff because I'm sending my signal up to a live 365. But,

94
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Bye.

95
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay, never mind that, but another case of this weird flesh-eating bacteria, apparently

96
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,440
this guy, he was, I think it was a 52 when he was a doctor.

97
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:39,840
He cut himself boating and it got infected, they had to amputate the knee, blow the knee,

98
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
and he died.

99
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,720
The bacteria ate him up.

100
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,120
I wouldn't mind knowing a little bit more about that and how to avoid it.

101
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,120
And finally I released the iPod or script today, released being a big word.

102
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,280
But I got so fed up with just having this, I lost my scripts and recompiled or compiled

103
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,560
them incorrectly so I couldn't get the real source back.

104
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
So I'd step back to a couple versions ago which I'd saved.

105
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,560
I've gotten much better at that now and I reconstruct what I had done and of course

106
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,160
the script came out even better and it's working really nicely.

107
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I figured alright now is the time to get it out there.

108
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
People look at it so you can understand.

109
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,180
What is I've been talking about?

110
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:31,020
How I see a totally open market?

111
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,780
Because I'm on a Mac, I did it all on a Mac, it works on a Mac, but the iPod is also kind

112
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,780
of ours, right?

113
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,820
It's not that we let them use it now.

114
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,180
But just by connecting all these dots, I think it's really interesting where you fire

115
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,780
the script up and it does all the work for you.

116
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,440
All you have to know about as someone who has an iPod and a Mac is that you receive new

117
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,580
audio shows automatically, you didn't have to do anything, no downloading, no transferring,

118
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,380
just put your iPod in the dock and you're good to go.

119
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,580
And there's a million different things that I could have done better in the script and

120
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,860
it's not even really ready to run if you don't know what you're doing in Apple Script.

121
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,140
You have to change the folder basically where you want all the file stored.

122
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Download with caution is a link to it on my on my web log and

123
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,040
Tomorrow it's back to work again two more weeks of doing the morning show up until August 31st, and then

124
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,640
That's it. I'll be a free man

125
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,440
And looking forward to it, but we also have a lot of great guests this this week and I'm sure I'll learn a lot as I

126
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
chat with them every morning from 6 to 9 a.m. And

127
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,240
I'll be talking to you guys

128
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,320
Probably right after each show every day. I was thinking maybe I'm recording him on my commute back to Belgium

129
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,040
Although doing all that with a laptop in the car is a

130
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,040
challenging again

131
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,440
Something to look at man, maybe I should I maybe I should do one of these while I'm flying home

132
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,600
All right

133
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,040
That's it for today. I'm going to leave you see how long I've been at this 13 minutes yet long enough

134
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,200
I want to get I actually wanted to play the FCC song

135
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,480
was it said Eric Idyllith?

136
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,780
think from Monty Python because I don't know if everyone's heard that or not.

137
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,820
But I'll just have to do that tomorrow.

138
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:38,420
So this was my source code for Sunday, August 15, 2004.

139
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,820
You can reach me at adam at curry.com and my web log address is live.kurry.com.

140
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
