00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 845, the Snapfoo Saturday Edition.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With 16 months to 7 minutes ensuring 5 nights of time.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The 21st century of radio stars.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We can't see any of our lives.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know it's true.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fantastic.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He's a very great.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Our father is a doctor.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He's our fat.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Feeling bad.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My mother works for charity when they push her.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And they're more good clean Americans who abide by the law.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And they both take up for liberty and they both support more.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My happiness must pay for when they lay their money down.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
For summers in a summer camp.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And winter's in the town.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've featured in the system.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're stuck about and play.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But I gave it up for music and a free electric band.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I went to school and had washers with me.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And the school was taken newly built and filled with light of air.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And the teenagers are as values that we had to learn.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And they clipped the air off and the idol kid wins.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And my father organized for me.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A college in the east.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I went to California.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The sunshine and the beach.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My parents and my lecturers could never understand.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why I gave it up for music and a free electric band.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For they knew so soon.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I was speculating upon their sun's career.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But my father wore a civil engineer.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Just give me bread and water.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Look at all in my head.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Just all I need is music.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And of a free electric band.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My father sent me money at last.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And didn't pay me fast.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I'm good.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm making breakfast.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I'm so so sad.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And we learned about her body.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But her mind we didn't know.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Until she brought it up to two ten models.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Be good to show.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And she wanted to get married.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Even though she never said.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I knew no well enough by now.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To see inside her head.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She's at a bus of a beer.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And a little patch of it.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I gave her up for music.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And a free electric band.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hi out.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
In the morning to y'all.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
As we officially started in the morning.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's the snap.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We started English in the daily source code.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Episode 845 is going to be a warm one.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Of course today is obviously Saturday.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Not a Friday.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So not the normal full bar extravaganza.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're trying to make you ears bleed.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It might get reasonably close.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is actually the happy birthday to me.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fuck you all edition of the Charlie.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Which means I'm playing songs that you will never ever ever ever ever hear on the radio.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But of course, they're all important parts of the soundtrack of my life.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I hope you enjoy the show.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The party, of course, is always in the chat room.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We've got that net and we're streaming live into AgendaStream.com.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The Black Betty and the Ram Jam.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Just a minute.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll shake it with blood out of ears then.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And this time it ain't no match.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Fuck it's the original name.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Shit.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can hear this song already.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Bring it back.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The art of radio globally is the Charlie.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you see eight four five?

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Black Betty.

I'll finish them later.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:18,000
When we got no class, and we got no principles, and we got no innocence, we can't even think of a murderer.

152

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,940
Time to go home

161
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,000
Alistduper on David Silver's code, episode eight, fort five

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,760
It is the Snappys Saturday Edition

163
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,260
I gotta tell you, it's the feeling I have here today

164
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,160
at the Healtop Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,460
is one of kind of nostalgia back in the days

166
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,780
when I was doing radio on broadcasts,

167
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,860
transmitters, and towers, and stuff.

168
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,580
It's kind of like Saturday morning shift.

169
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,260
Yeah, let's wake up everybody.

170
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,500
Come on, swing it low.

171
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
When it first dies, it's tomorrow.

172
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Love is changing my eyes.

173
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Tonight, while chasing the clouds,

174
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
where and where and where.

175
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I'll bring it in the key that shows the singing.

176
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
As if there's a light in the mirror.

177
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Now the stars roll tonight.

178
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,500
I'll bring it in the key that shows the singing.

180
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
As if there's something.

181
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Oh, that would have been so far without you.

182
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Oh, that would have been so far without you.

183
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I got to with you, won't it have you and your heart to see you?

184
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

185
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Now it's about about love, chance to move

186
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

187
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Now it's about love, chance to move

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

189
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Now it's about love, chance to move

190
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

191
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Now it's about love, chance to move

192
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

193
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Now it's about love, chance to move

194
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

195
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Now it's about love, chance to move

196
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Now it's about love, chance to move

197
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Only if you don't know, remember how we knew I was real to stay

198
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Now normally on a daily store, it's going to only stream it out live and no agenda

199
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Stream.com, I'm looking for requests and try and pull the party together

200
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
As a concerted group effort, not so today I'm afraid

201
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Because I really went back into the soundtrack of my life and pulled up

202
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
As many songs as I like and as I wanted to play on today's show

203
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Because of course, so yesterday was my birthday

204
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
And I get to do what I want to do

205
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Right?

206
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
But maybe I'll enjoy it anyway

207
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
All from the soundtrack to my life

208
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Because you ain't got no one to ask for you

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,500
There's an open road that beats nowhere

210
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,500
So just make sure my house between you and that

211
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,500
There's a hole in my head where we ain't got fit

212
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You took my body and fled to me

213
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Ha ha ha ha

214
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Quiet shame, because you ain't got nobody else to play

215
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
We are one

216
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
We are one

217
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
We are one

218
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
We are one

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
We're the one, not the time

220
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,500
But I'm not too hot to settle down

221
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,500
But I feel that it's my only single separate way

222
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I'm in the line in the day

223
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Ha ha ha

224
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
What you don't do

225
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Just try all of the things that the market

226
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
So feel that you ain't

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Took you very catch your face on both the very next train

228
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

229
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
We are one

230
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
We are one

231
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
We are one

232
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
We are one

233
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
We are one

234
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
We are one

235
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
We are one

236
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
We are one

237
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
We are one

238
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
We are one

239
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
We are one

240
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,500
I hope you'll remember how you're coming home

241
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Now you're trying the way to get the song

242
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I hope you'll remember how you're coming home

243
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You may know I know you dreamt of

244
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Give me a round of depth and time and cry

245
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Oh, it's gonna last forever

246
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I hope there's a hope

247
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
That you ain't got nowhere to go

248
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Give me a round of depth and time

249
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Give me a round of depth and time

250
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Give me a round of depth and time

251
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Give me a round of depth and time

252
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I remember the album

253
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I'd like that kind of jute box

254
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Neon light spaceship on it

255
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Oh, man

256
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
That was back when we had those black plastic things called vinyl

257
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Electric light orchestra evil woman on the daily source code episode 845 is the force of September 2010

258
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
And of course yesterday I celebrated my 46th birthday was

259
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Wow, it was a weird one in a way

260
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
First of all, thank you to everybody who tweeted me sent me emails

261
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
And actually, you know, I do have a Facebook account

262
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Not that I do too much with it because I don't trust them

263
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I know that everything I put on there could be gone at any minute

264
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I can never get it back

265
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
It's kind of weird, you know, you get all these

266
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
On the one hand, I really like Facebook because

267
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
It automatically notifies you of people

268
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Within your friends network

269
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Of their birthday and so, you know, I got a lot of birthday well

270
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Wishes from people I hadn't heard from in years and years

271
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
A lot of people from MTV from my previous company's friends

272
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
But in the other hand, it doesn't feel quite right

273
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
You know, because I know that they didn't actually think of me

274
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
It's like Facebook reminded him, you know

275
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Like, oh, I'll sign, I'll write two lines to Adam

276
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
So I'm a little bit torn about it

277
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
But was fantastic as Miss Mickey really took care of me

278
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
In true Dutch tradition, she decorated my chair

279
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
I was the birthday boy, she had a great balloon for me

280
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Which I think I posted a video of it

281
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I tweeted that

282
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
If you hate it, then it plays this rock and roll song

283
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Which is great, she had a huge box of presents

284
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Every single picture I own

285
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
And I've lost many, many throughout the years

286
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
But every picture I own of

287
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Of me with the, you know, superstars and cool people

288
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Hangin out, she had them all framed in beautiful new frames

289
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
So I'm gonna hang those on my wall

290
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
She got me, well, of course, she got me the old spy

291
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
So I asked for, obviously

292
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
And a pair of new swimming trunks

293
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
And she took me out to dinner last night

294
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
To the little door here in Los Angeles, which is just outstanding

295
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,500
And I also appreciate y'all not bitching about not having a football Friday

296
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
I think I only saw one tweet, just one

297
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Saying hey, are you gonna do a show today

298
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
And I actually would have liked to have done one

299
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Since we're going to get Monation Lowlands next week

300
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
I had to pre-produce

301
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
No less than nine big app show episodes

302
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
And so I produced them, I edited them

303
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
We did a really cool one, Mickey and I, for the ultimate perfect egg timer

304
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
So we went off green screen and actually used the thing

305
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
It's an amazing app, it works, the egg is exactly the way it was predicted

306
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Because apparently, size of the egg

307
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
The temperature of the egg and the altitude at which you cook it makes quite a difference

308
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
So it turns out here in the hilltop watch tower

309
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
We have to, if you want a medium soft boiled egg

310
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
So a little bit more than soft, you have to, and if it's from the fridge

311
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
You got to cook it for six minutes and thirty-six seconds

312
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Anyway, but back to my birthday

313
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
It's a weird one because 46 of course is not really a number that makes

314
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
I was like, 45 is kind of an even, almost not even number

315
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
But it's kind of like one of those numbers in between 50, 40 and 50

316
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
And 46 is kind of nothing

317
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
But also, for me, kind of

318
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Finalize the reboot process

319
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
We're now in December, I'm officially unemployed, no more checks coming in

320
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm living off of the support of producers of the no agenda show

321
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
And the no agenda stream

322
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Getting the big app show up and running

323
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
It'll take another year, I'm sure, before it actually sustains anything

324
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
It takes time, I've got to figure out the real business model

325
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Which I'm not too worried about, I'm more interested in getting audience

326
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Thank you all for retweeting Mickey's request, by the way

327
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Did pick up several thousand new audience members in the past week

328
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Mainly, I would say thanks to the appearance on Twitter, which was great

329
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
So I'm just building that and working with a developer on an android version

330
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I've already seen screenshots and it's coming along

331
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Working on the video and getting that form fitted into all the devices

332
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
And I'm actually quite excited about it

333
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Particularly after the, and that was really, I have to say kind of a downer

334
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
This week, looking at the Steve Jobs keynote

335
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
I was very excited to have Apple TV include iOS 4 and have apps

336
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
And I was like, yeah, this is the future

337
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
And it's like, why this thing is dumb

338
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Okay, I think Apple is jumping the shark on me, I love their computers, I love my iPhone

339
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,500
But, holy moly, I have to say I think that the big app show on android will be more fun

340
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
It seems more rock and roll, more punk rock really

341
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Anyway, the reboot process has basically finished

342
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
And here we are, we're flying without a net, we're sailing

343
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,500
And just hoping for the wind to come along and keep us moving forward

344
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,500
And it's scary in a way, you know, particularly in this mid-life reboot

345
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
And it's exciting, it's invigorating, exhilarating at the same time

346
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,500
But there will be, oh, lots of work, not afraid of it, like it, I really do

347
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,500
And it's great to have so many friends hanging out along for the ride and being so incredibly supportive

348
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,500
So anyway, so this morning, actually last night we had this great dinner

349
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,500
And I did have several moments of really really missing my mom, which was kind of funky

350
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,500
And although Mickey and I both think that both our moms are, we're with us in the past few days

351
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Probably drinking a big cup of Joe themselves, looking down at us in Smiling

352
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,500
And so this morning when I got up, I'm like, even though I was up for a couple hours

353
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,500
And didn't really get back to sleep until 430, I was a woken in such an incredibly nice manner, Miss Mickey, thank you

354
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,500
I decided to just pull a whole song that are from the soundtrack to my life

355
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,500
It'll be a total music appreciation experience, it'll be something different for y'all

356
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
So bear with me

357
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,500
This is from one of the albums I had just around the time, I think I was 15 and I was building my own radio transmitter

358
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Have my mom drive me around the blocks, you know, far the signal would reach, it's just from the moonflower

359
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
I think it was the double album

360
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,500
But listen to nonstop over and over again, Santa

361
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Don't want to be about her, don't wish you light

362
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Don't want to be about her, how many people cried

363
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,500
And it's too late to say you were sorry, how would I know, why should I care

364
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Please don't bother trying to find her, she's not there

365
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:37,500

378
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,500
You know, why don't you be about her, what could I do

379
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,500
You know, why don't you be about her, what could I do

380
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:49,500

You know, why don't you be about her, what could I do

383
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:27,500
You know, why don't you be about her

384
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,180
to turn that up so loud on my my phone a graph that I had at the time from the moon

385
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,740
flower double album she's not there Santana on the daily source code episode 845 I

386
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,480
got to tell you I have a really weird feeling today and it's partially I think is

387
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,260
because there's these stories floating around about Howard Stern hinting it may

388
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,700
be going online instead of on serious which of course you know I made him a

389
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:58,580
sincere, serious and funded offer of a hundred million dollars a year to do

390
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,100
just that which I think he'll easily be able to clear certainly in the first

391
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,740
year which is exactly what I offered I think I put the bug in his ear and he's

392
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,380
thinking I don't he'd carry for that of course he doesn't he could do with

393
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,380
anybody he wants he could do it himself but it gives me you know when I'm here

394
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,420
in that I'm thinking you know we're so incredibly close to radio completely

395
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,180
shifting over to to online everything being run through apps again the big mistake

396
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,100
I think that Apple is making with Apple TV is you know so what was the Steve

397
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,140
Jobs quote RPR customers the they aren't users I think you actually said

398
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,020
which I hate like you're like your drug addicts our users they don't want

399
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,140
amateur hour ten I'm thinking you know that really gave me this spur I'm like

400
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,180
you know I should just get on this thing every single frickin morning and do a

401
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,860
two three or four hour show you know mixing a little bit of knowledge and the

402
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,820
topics there and roll out some great music soundtrack to your life and I

403
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,220
think I could get enough people to support me to keep doing it forever but

404
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,580
maybe just a thought for now it's uh it takes real dedication

405
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:14,580
actual work involves let's count the ways I only utilized one but apparently

406
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,820
there's about 50 ways to leave your lover well you're actually right for that

407
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,620
man as long as you got a plan stand you can always slip out the back jack

408
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:31,700
if you got the key Lee problem is all inside your head she said to me the answer

409
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:38,820
is easy if you take it logically I'd like to help you in your struggle to be

410
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:46,980
free there must be 50 ways to leave her lover she said it's really not my

411
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,740
habit to and true for the more I hope my meaning won't be lost on this

412
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,940
constraint but I repeat myself at the risk of being cruel there must be

413
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:08,060
50 ways to leave your lover 50 ways to leave your lover you just slip

414
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:13,020

415
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:20,300
quite wrong just get yourself free hop on the bus because you don't need to discuss

416
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:29,100
much just come off the key Lee and get yourself me who's about back jack make

417
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,380

418
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:43,180
the bus because you don't need to discuss much just come off the key Lee and get

419
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:52,860
yourself free she said it grieves me so to see you in such pain I wish

420
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,660
there was something I could do to make you smile again I said I appreciate that

421
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:10,140
and would you please explain about the 50 ways she said why don't we both just slip

422
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:17,580
on it tonight and I believe in the morning begin to see the light and then she kissed me

423
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:24,220
and I realized she probably was right there must be 50 ways to leave your lover

424
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:34,700
50 ways to leave your lover you just slip out the back jack make a new plan stand

425
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:41,100
you don't need to be quite wrong just get yourself free oh you hop on the bus

426
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,740
because you don't need to discuss much just come off the key Lee and get yourself

427
00:32:47,740 --> 00:33:15,900
all sign up must be 50 ways to leave your lover now you never hear that one on the radio anymore

428
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,980
do you absolutely not so I'm thinking more and more about this daily show that would be

429
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,580
I mean it's a lot of work man so it would really you know if if I can prove the model

430
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,740
that we've already kind of established with no agenda then it actually might work

431
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,900
and you know the real thing with you know like there's only one place you make money in radio

432
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,220
and that's really in the morning however and that which means you'd have to be on the east

433
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,540
coast you have to be in New York it has to be repeated for the west coast and for other

434
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,100
parts around the world but really when you think about it there's just no way that you can

435
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,860
ever do a morning show everywhere because it's always for 20 somewhere else it's always in

436
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,700
the morning somewhere actually that's probably the way you should look at it but what if I just

437
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,140
started a nine this nine o'clock I would be kind of like a work time for everybody it was just

438
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,020
do it maybe can change the way it works everyone's listening to the morning shows you listen

439
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,860
to how or listen to your local morning show and then you know once you're kind of at work

440
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,500
and you're and you're vibing then you know I play some cool tunes make your ears bleed a little bit

441
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,340
and you know fight the new world order together and stuff would you actually support that

442
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,980
would you really sign up for it would you would you really really support it that's the question

443
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:28,380
what do you think about it what do you think about it what do you think about it what do you think about it

444
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,460
it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it

445
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:28,380
it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like want me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me but it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like and that right it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for me it's like for

446
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:43,380
I'm not quite sure where it came from, I think I got it from Kla Tu who sent it out on the email list.

447
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:50,380
So no agenda entertainment dot com is updating the daily source code eight four five playlists live with all of the iTunes links.

448
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
You can grab the songs as we go along.

I don't think you'll be able to find that one though. This one however, for sure.

450
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,380
We got to do our alma mater, we must do our alma mater.

451
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:08,380
When I was a little baby boy, my grandmother bought me a cute little toy.

452
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:16,380
Silverbell's hanging on her string. She told me it was my dingling lingo.

I heard I hear I hear two girls over here singing in harmony. That's all right, honey

456
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,320
This is a free country live like you want to live

You got a right baby. You know about it won't bother you

460
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,560
Once I was climbing the garden wall

461
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,640
I slipped and had a terrible fall

462
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,600
I felt so hard hurt bells ring but held on the Monday

463
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I

464
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,220
You don't have to use your palm and out that thing

465
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
oh

466
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
ancies

467
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,720
Once I was swimming across Turtle Creek,

468
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,360
man, him snap was all around my feet.

469
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,640
Show us hard swimming cross that thing.

470
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,080
We both hands holding my feet.

471
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,360
You're a guy!

472
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,360
You're a guy!

473
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,360
You're a guy!

474
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,360
You're a guy!

475
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,360
You're a guy!

476
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,360
You're a guy!

477
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,560
You're a guy!

478
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,880
That's so beautiful!

479
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,520
I think it's a beautiful little song really I do.

480
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,840
And guess what everybody's still not singing?

481
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,040
There's a few right down front here that's not singing.

482
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,680
We're going to dedicate this verse to those who will not sing.

483
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,920
Yes sir, this here song, it ain't so sad.

484
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,400
The cutest little song you ever had.

485
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,840
Those of you who will not sing,

486
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,000
you must be praying with your own dignity.

487
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,360
Oh you're dangling.

491
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,000
Yo, Daniel, we saw you play me, Daniel

492
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,040
Hey, my dayling, everybody's saying

493
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,760
I want to play with my, the everybody's mine

494
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,320
Oh my, throw them high

495
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Wanna play here, buddy?

496
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,560
With my

497
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,800
Gingers

498
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
The infamous Chuck Berry

499
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,680
I've had that song on deck for weeks now and finally I had an opportunity to play

500
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Yeah, baby

501
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,200
Need to get back into some rhythms and groove, some blues, some rec guy by that

502
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
All around in my home

503
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,200
You're trying to track me down

504
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,240
Let's say they want to bring me in

505
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,200
For the killing of the density

506
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,320
For the life of the density

507
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
But I say

508
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:04,360
I shut the chair

509
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,360
But I swear it wasn't so big thanks

510
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,040
I shut the chair

511
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,080
They say it's a kept underluffing

512
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Oh

513
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,840
Sherry, John, John always painted me

514
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,080
For what?

515
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,440
I don't know

516
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,080
Every time that I can't foresee

517
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,680
You said kill it before, let me go

518
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,800
He said kill it before it goes

519
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,760
I swear

520
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I shut the chair

521
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,040
But I swear it wasn't so big thanks

522
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,280
I shut the chair

523
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,680
But I swear it wasn't so big thanks

524
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,440
I shut the chair

525
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,120
Freedom came my way one day

526
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,080
And I started out and fell

527
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,840
All of a sudden I see Sherry John now

528
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,920
Maybe this should be down

529
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,640
So I shut

530
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,200
I shut it down

531
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,200
I shut

532
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
I shut the chair

533
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,960
But I did not shoot the deputy

534
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,120
I shut the chair

535
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
But I did shoot the deputy

536
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
I shut the chair

537
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,960
Reflection's got the bet on me

538
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,760
What is to be must be

539
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,120
Everything the fuck goes to the world

540
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,000
One day the bottle will drop out

541
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,040
Yes one day the bottle will drop out

542
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
I say

543
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,200
Sing a one

544
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
I shut the chair

545
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,200
But I did shoot the deputy

546
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
I like that chair, I know that was kind of fun

547
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,200
I shut the chair

548
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,200
But I did not shoot the deputy

549
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Nice to see the discussion in the chat room

550
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,000
Now I don't think you would be a subscription based show

551
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,240
I think you just got to support it the way it's always supported

552
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,640
It would have to be it couldn't be a daily source code either

553
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,440
It has to be like a no agenda daily show

554
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,640
That's where the audience is

555
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,920
That's where the girls market is people who are pissed off and unhappy at the government and the new world are taking over

556
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,080
And of course for the cap trails

557
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,320
And the 9-11 inside job and all the other shit that's going on

558
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,680
That's what people want to hear

559
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,480
So no, no, no, I would have to be something just a little bit different

560
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,560
However, I would roll out the jams

561
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,280
I think there's a combination to be made that would work very very well

562
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,760
But first let's do the big app show on Android, okay? Let's get that done

563
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,160
After that's out rolling got someone hired to help me produce and edit so I'm not doing all that all day

564
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Maybe we could consider it

565
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,320
I know you guys would support it

566
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,160
Another one of the first 45s that ever held my hand from David Bowie's fame

567
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,080
I would like to listen to a little bit

568
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,880
Hey, hey, what you get is no tomorrow

569
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,680
Hey, what you need to have to borrow

570
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,080
Hey

571
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,320
Hey, I think mine is just as light to find your time and touch the floor

572
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:29,320
Hey

573
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,840
Can you play or

574
00:48:51,320 --> 00:49:21,320

00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Fight!

577
00:49:52,320 --> 00:50:22,320
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

579
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:59,320
And another one from the soundtrack to my life, one of the most beautiful songs ever produced tears for fears, head over heels of love, baby

580
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Does it have to say that's what I am?

581
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,320
Come on Kurt Rollin, rip it out for me

582
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,320
It's a child in your face, you want to escape my attention

583
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,320
You keep your distance, be the system of touch

584
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:42,320
And gentle persuasion, I'm lost in admiration

585
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,320
And I need you this much, for you is the matter

586
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,320
You're just just wasting time

587
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:57,320
So take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind, never mind

588
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

589
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:08,320
So take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

590
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,320
And I need you this much, for you is the matter

591
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:27,320
You're just just wasting time, you're just just wasting time

592
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,320
So take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

593
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,320
You're just wasting time, you're just wasting time

594
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,320
So take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

595
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,320
And I need you this much, for you is the matter

596
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:52,320
You're just just wasting time, you're just wasting time

597
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,320
So take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

598
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:05,320
Take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

599
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:11,320
Take the roots that I'm doing, it's my never mind

600
00:53:41,320 --> 00:54:11,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

601
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:28,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, finally, !

602
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:53,400
Should just happen to be cruising through the interwebs through the series of tubes and

603
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,320
you stumbled across this program, which is highly unlikely.

604
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,600
This is the Daily Source Code, it's episode 845, we've been going out for more than five

605
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
and a half years.

606
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,760
This is the Snappu Saturday edition of the show, which these days is pretty much weekly.

607
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,080
And this is the birthday soundtrack to my life.

608
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:20,360
Okay, you'll love singing along with this one.

609
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,880
Oh, come on, don't tell me that you don't know the song.

610
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,480
It's a perfect family, goddammit.

611
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:33,320
And right in the middle of a good dream, I call it once I wake up from something

612
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,000
that keeps knocking at my brain.

613
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,800
Before I go insane, I hold my pillow to my head and spring up in my bed.

614
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,240
Screaming out the words I dread, I think I love you.

615
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:56,480
This morning, I woke up with this feeling, I didn't know how to deal with.

616
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:04,920
And so I just decided to myself, I'd hide it to myself, and never talk about it.

617
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:13,920
And did not go in shouted when you walked into the room, I think I love you.

618
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,120
So what am I so afraid of?

619
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:23,920
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of, I love there is no cure for.

620
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,920
I think I love you, isn't that what life has made up?

621
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,920
Go with what is need to say that I've never felt this way.

622
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:53,920
I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of?

623
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,920
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of, I love there is no cure for.

624
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:05,920
I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of?

625
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:13,920
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of, I love there is no cure for.

626
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,920
I think I love you, isn't that what life has made up?

627
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Go with what is need to say that I've never felt this way.

628
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Believe me, you really don't have to worry.

629
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,920
I only want to make you happy, and if you say it the way I will,

630
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,920
but I think there's still a lot better stay around and love you.

631
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:44,920
If you think I have a piece, let me ask you to your pastry that you love me.

632
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:51,920
I think I love you, I think I love you, but think I love you.

633
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:58,920
What I love you, what I love you, what I love you, what I love you, what I love you.

634
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,920
You see, this is what we've discussed many times before.

635
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,920
When you play a song like this, the cartridge family, and I think I love you.

636
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,920
You can't play that on the radio because the program director, the music director, will come right?

637
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,920
First of all, that'd be off play list because the computer didn't spit it out.

638
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,920
You're like, you can't play that man that songs to gay man, that's wrong!

639
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,920
You'd be like, I know, I know that 85% of the audience has gone,

640
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,920
What are you just going?

641
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Wow, I remember this.

642
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,920
I know what going.

643
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,920
Go ahead, you can admit it.

644
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,920
One of the airways is landed and he's sounding good to me.

645
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:38,920
This is the Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

646
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,920
CJ, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay you?

647
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:04,760
But by long-awaiting enough, I forgot you were my name.

648
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,920
Whatever I love, I'm just blinking a chain.

649
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,920
por everything I want, me.

650
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,920
I'm nothing but your fool

651
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
You're treating me

652
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,920
Oh, you're treating me cruel

653
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,920
Change, change, change, change

654
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Change, change, change, change

655
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,920
Yeah, but it's ain't

656
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,920
Has got a way to leave

657
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,920
I might be leecher

658
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,920
All I need is strength or faith

659
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,920
You're told me you're

660
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,920
My father said, come on home

661
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,920
My doctor said, take it easy

662
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,920
How much you love it, little much too strong

663
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,920
I'm headed to you, change, change, change

664
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,920
Change, change, change, change, change

665
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Change, change, change, change, change

666
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,920
Change, change, change, change, change

667
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,920
What have you bought in my heart

668
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,920
The chain of the main

669
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,920
What up until we get

670
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,920
I'm gonna take all our identities

671
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Oh, you're treating, change, change, change

672
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,920
Change, change, change, change, change, change, change

673
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,920
Change, change, change, change, change

674
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,920
What have you been?

675
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,920
I can just hear our standing

676
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,920
And it's here standing in the boat, you know?

677
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Just joking out.

678
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,920
Oh yeah.

679
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
Chating, chating.

680
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Oh man.

681
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,920
Chating, chating.

682
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,920
I don't make songs like that anymore.

683
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,920
Oh damn, that's nice.

684
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,920
This reminded me, you know, last night Miss Mickey made me the most wonderful offer ever.

685
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,920
And I'm very, very excited about it.

686
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,920
She said, you know, when everything is kind of win all things are right.

687
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,920
And I think this will probably be around March, springtime.

688
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,920
And it will actually require the Delta Shara to be sold.

689
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,920
That's my aircraft, which oh my god.

690
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,920
This is like, you know, you want to worst time in the world to sell an airplane.

691
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,920
Pick now.

692
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,920
So I'm going to take a huge bath on it.

693
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,920
But that's okay.

694
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:00,920
But once that thing is sold, then we'll actually have enough money to get one of those big cruise

695
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,920
America RVs.

696
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,920
And she would like me to show her America.

697
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:12,920
And I'm thinking, wow, first of all, what a, what a, what a, what a beautiful gesture.

698
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,920
And, you know, it's one of those things we always say, yeah, we're going to go across America.

699
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,920
When a drive across America, I'm going to do this.

700
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,920
I'm going to do that.

701
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
And you never really do it, right?

702
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,920
And so she'd said, you know, it doesn't matter what's going on with my career.

703
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,920
You know, if all of a sudden there's something I got to do, I can always fly back or whatever

704
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
and come back.

705
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
That's fine.

706
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
That would work out beautifully.

707
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,920
So the idea would be to get one of those kind of midsize, but maybe one with the living room pops out,

708
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,920
you know, and loaded up, we'll get our two max.

709
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,920
We'll get, well, throw the green screen in the back.

710
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Because of course, I got to continue the big app show.

711
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,920
We'll get lots of 3G equipment and crap like that.

712
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,920
And we'll just drive across America.

713
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,920
I know that we'd have plenty of people to see all over these United States, which would be awesome.

714
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,920
That would be the time to start doing a daily show.

715
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,920
And, you know, she's way into photography.

716
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,920
So, you know, I'm not quite sure we don't really have a plan.

717
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,920
The plan is we have no plan.

718
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,920
But wow, I was like, you know, I'm really excited about that idea.

719
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,920
So, I guess we're kind of moving towards that.

720
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,920
And I would love nothing more.

721
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,920
How awesome would that be, just a real, you know, like a month or something.

722
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,920
Or not really even take a designated amount of time.

723
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,920
And just say, let's just go and rent one of those big cruisers for the big cruise america.com on the back.

724
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,920
And just roll around the states.

725
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,920
And then, you know, continue to do stuff.

726
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,920
I mean, I can easily do no agenda.

727
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,920
I can easily do source code.

728
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,920
Maybe the no agenda daily in the big app show and just roll with it.

729
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,920
You've got to be able to afford it because, you know, we can't like close up this house.

730
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,920
So, it basically, when you get one of those things, it's like rent for another house.

731
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,920
Because they're not cheap, particularly if you want one that actually has room for the green screen.

732
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,920
But I'm very, very excited about it.

733
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,920
And I think that, uh, I think we're actually going to do it.

734
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,920
Can you guess the song?

735
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,920
Nah, forget it.

736
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Because they don't play it on the radio ever.

737
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,920
But it changes coming up for us.

738
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,920
But it changes coming up for us.

739
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,920
But it changes coming up for us.

740
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,920
But it changes coming up for us.

741
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,920
But it changes coming up for us.

742
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,920
But it changes coming up for us.

743
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,920
But it changes coming up for us.

744
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,920
But it changes coming up for us.

745
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,920
But it changes coming up for us.

746
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,920
But it changes coming up for us.

747
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,920
But it changes coming up for us.

748
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,920
But it changes coming up for us.

749
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,920
But it changes coming up for us.

750
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,920
But it changes coming up for us.

751
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,920
But it changes coming up for us.

752
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,920
Oh, yes, it will.

753
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,920
It's been two months, living.

754
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,920
But I'm afraid to die.

755
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,920
I'm going to live like that.

756
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,920
And I'm going to die.

757
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,920
It's been a long long.

758
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,920
A long time coming, but I know.

759
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,920
It changes coming up for us.

760
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,920
Oh, yes, it will.

761
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,920
I'm going to live like that.

762
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,920
And I'm going to die.

763
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,920
Somebody keep telling me, don't.

764
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,920
I'm going to die.

765
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,920
It's been a long.

766
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,920
A long time coming, but I know.

767
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,920
It changes going up.

768
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,920
Oh, yes, it will.

769
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,920
Then I go to my brother.

770
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:08,920
And I say, brother, help me please.

771
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,920
But he wants up, not in me.

772
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,920
But I don't mind.

773
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,920
Oh, there's something I've got.

774
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,920
I could last for long.

775
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,920
But now I think I'll be both.

776
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
Carry on.

777
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,920
It's been a long.

778
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,920
A long time coming, but I know.

779
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,920
I know it's kind of hard.

780
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
Oh, what is this?

781
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,920
It is Sam Cook, my friends.

782
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
A part of your musical upbringing.

783
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,920
Don't worry, you'll thank me many, many years from now.

784
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,920
Speaking of our road trip, we'll be trailer trash, you're right.

785
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,920
That's perfect.

786
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,920
Busted flat and Ben Rouge.

787
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,920
Waiting for train.

788
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,920
When I speak the news, faded as magic.

789
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,920
Bob it thunded, diesel day.

790
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,920
Just a foreign.

791
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,920
Throwed a song away to New Orleans.

792
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,920
I pulled my heart boom.

793
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,920
And I'm out there to hear it, Ben Denner.

794
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,920
I swear in soft love, I'll be saying the blue.

795
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
Yeah.

796
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,920
When she'll watch her serpent time, I was holding Bob his hand in man.

797
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,920
We sang every song that java knew.

798
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,920
Freedom is just another word.

799
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,920
For nothing left to lose.

800
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
Nothing.

801
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,920
I'm in nothing on a fit A free.

802
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Yeah, feeling like it was easy now.

803
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
When he sang a blues, you know.

804
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,920
Even good was good enough for me.

805
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,920
Good enough for me and my Bob and I.

806
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,920
From the king and took the coal man.

807
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,920
To be the kind of foreign son.

808
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,920
If I've been shared the secrets of my soul.

809
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,920
Through all kinds of weather.

810
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,920
The weather's fine and we're done.

811
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
You're Bob it, baby.

812
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,920
Help me, Bob.

813
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,920
For one day, I'm New Orleans.

814
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,920
For no home.

815
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
I let him slip away.

816
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,920
He's looking for that home.

817
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
And I hope he finds it.

818
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,920
But I've trained all I'm not tomorrow's.

819
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
But once I know, I have to think.

820
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,920
To be the only Bob is Bob next to mine.

821
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,920
Freedom is just another word.

822
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
For nothing left to lose.

823
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,920
Nothing.

824
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
I'm in nothing left.

825
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,920
Yeah, feeling like it was easy now.

826
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,920
When he sang a blues, you know.

827
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,920
Even good was good enough for me.

828
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,920
Good enough for me and my Bob and I.

01:10:49,920 --> 01:11:18,320
I got to tell you, you know, whenever we do the show live, and no agenda stream.com, of course, you're probably listening to it on the podcasts.

832
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:36,320
95% of the audience does. I'm sitting here looking at the chatroom school by, and by the way, which I love because it really makes me feel like I've got my friends here with me, and it's just kind of sad though to see some of the younger kids say, oh, this must be Dolly Parton.

833
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:51,320
No, Janice Joplin, who was one of the true original rock and rollers. The first woman to say she wouldn't go on unless she had a groupie fucker. I know many record guys who had to go out and troll for some dudes.

834
01:11:52,320 --> 01:12:00,320
And they were, and oh, there's so many stories because of course she always smelled like vomit because she was so whacked out on heroin and then everything else.

835
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,320
And she was punk rock or way before it was fashion.

836
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:17,320
Hey, you know, Mickey just came in naked from outside, which was very cool. She's wearing this bandana like she's already in her trailer trash mode, which is amazing. I'm so excited about her road trip. So let's play some road trip music, shall we?

837
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,320
If you're rolling right now during this show, you're going to appreciate this crank it up.

838
01:12:47,320 --> 01:13:17,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

850
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:51,440
And every lock that ain't locked, when no one's around, I think trailers for sale are rent.

Rounds to left, if it's sense.

01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,440
I ain't got 12 or 4 bit room by the end.

855

Hey, you know, maybe we shouldn't even wait for the delta share to get sold.

861
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:53,440
Maybe we should just get the, I'm sure someone can sponsor one of those big things.

862
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,440
Maybe cruise America dot com would sponsor it.

863
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,440
The air stream or somebody.

864
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,440
And yeah, that's the only thing that's the, I mean, I can pay for the gas.

865
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,440
Barely, but I can pay for the gas.

866
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Let's work on that chuckle heads.

867
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,440
Maybe we can, uh, work some out.

01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:14,440
For those of you who get monation east, this should sound familiar.

869
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:19,440
If you ever watch top of the pops, they use this over and over again, incessantly.

870

01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,480
by the Holy Spirit

925
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:15,300
Lay down inside

926
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,440
One more

927
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,040
You need

928
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:32,760
Lay

929
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:56,020
...

930
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:26,020
Oh, man, I'll be your back again, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

931
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:40,960
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh I love a sound listening to this song,

932
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,960
We might decide not to do it

933
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,960
We're still in the middle of this

934
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,960
We said hello, put it on the road

935
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,960
To say the least, the cat was told he said, I listen

936
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,960
But to call us, child, call us

937
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,960
I said, you got my number

938
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,960
I said, yeah, I got it when you walked through

939
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,960
I told my mother by the way

940
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,960
To call us

941
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,960
And we'll call you

942
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,960
And we'll call us

943
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,960
And we'll call us

944
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,960
And we'll call

945
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,960
And we'll call

946
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,960
And we'll call

947
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,960
Like this, you got your name for the criminal preempt

948
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,960
You said, he used to work with you

949
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,960
But you remembered all my creatures

950
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,960
Stereo, not a zoo

951
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,460
Baby, I do relate to one or track

952
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,960
Can't you know what a pen and plan this news?

953
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:10,960
Did you set our up?

954
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,960
I told you, I was a child, call you

955
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,460
I've got my number

956
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,940
And we'll call

957
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:23,960
And we'll call

958
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,960
And we'll call

959
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,960
And we'll call

960
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,960
And we'll call

961
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,960
And we'll call

962
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:52,520
I'm ready to race, I'm gonna get out of the trotterbed with the song he said he couldn't use

963
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:57,000
And now he calls and bakes and crawls it's countin' about day to move

964
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,040
Look at the city's voice and lousy choice

965
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,040
And all the glitter we can use, huh?

966
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,040
So I took color and now we'll call you

967
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,040
Yeah, baby

968
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,040
Let's see if we can get more of the car

969
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,040
Let's see if we can get more of the car

970
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,040
Let's see if we can get more of the car

971
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,040
Let's see if we can get more of the car

972
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,040
So don't call us

973
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,040
Yeah, baby

974
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,040
Come on

975
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,040
And we'll call us

976
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,040
And all those glitter we can use

977
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:50,040
Let's see if we can get more of the car

978
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:54,040
Let's see if we can get more of the car

979
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:24,000
This is one of those, I choose mistakes.

980
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,700
Wow, that was amazing.

981
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,700
I never heard that version.

982
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,700
Awesome.

983
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,800
Sugarloaf don't call us, we'll call you.

984
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,800
Wow, live.

985
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,800
I really like that.

986
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,200
Hey, now I was just thinking about this road trip.

987
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,800
You know, I'm stupid.

988
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,200
This is really simple.

989
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,800
This could be the Noah gender tour.

990
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,200
There's just Noah, where are you going?

991
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:52,800
We've got Noah gender, but we go and find all of the Noah gender producers all around

992
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,400
these United States and Canada, yes, of course, but I think we'll go to Alaska first

993
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,400
maybe.

994
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,000
That would be the coolest and the easy way to get it financed.

995
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,400
We'll just have the Noah gender producers support the road trip.

996
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,800
It's duh completely genius.

997
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:17,200
By the way, sound like a little bit like John Paul and George, here they are for real.

998
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,800
Oh, I need your love, babe.

999
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,800
Guess you know it's true.

1000
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:27,800
Oh, oh, you need my love, babe.

1001
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,800
Just like I need you.

1002
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,800
Oh, oh, me, love me.

1003
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,000
Oh, me, love me.

1004
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I ain't got love in my love, babe.

1005
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:48,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1006
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,400
Oh, oh, oh.

1007
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:55,800
Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1008
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1009
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love me.

1010
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:07,200
Oh, I ain't got love in my love, babe.

1011
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,200
Oh, look over here.

1012
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:15,200
Oh, hey, there's a weed

1013
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:19,200
I love you

1014
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,200
Hey, there's a weed

1015
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,200
Is not enough to show I care

1016
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,200
Oh, I need your love, babe

1017
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,200
Oh, guess you know it's true

1018
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:36,200
Oh, I hope you'll be my love, babe

1019
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Oh, just like I need you

1020
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,200
Oh, I hope me, love me

1021
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,200
Oh, me, love me

1022
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:50,200
Hey, it's got nothing else to love, babe

1023
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,200
Oh, hey, there's a weed

1024
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,200
Hey, there's a weed

1025
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:00,200
Oh, I love you

1026
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,200
Hey, there's a weed

1027
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,200
Is not enough to show I care

1028
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Oh, I need your love, babe

1029
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,200
Oh, I hope me, love me

1030
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:15,200
Oh, I hope me, love me

1031
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19,200
Hey, it's got nothing else to love, babe

1032
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,200
Hey, there's a weed

1033
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,200
Is not enough to show I care

1034
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Oh, I hope you'll be my love, babe

1035
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,200
Oh, I hope me, love me

1036
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,200
Hey, it's got nothing else to love, babe

1037
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Hey, there's a weed

1038
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,200
Hey, there's a weed

1039
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,200
Hey, there's a weed

1040
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
Hey, it's a weed

1041
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,200
Hey, it's a weed

1042
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,200
Yeah, I was pretty pissed off for that Steve Jobs

1043
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,200
Keynote that Apple streamed live

1044
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,200
And I'll tell you why, but besides all the Apple TV stuff

1045
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,200
And, you know, just being disappointed in general about that

1046
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,200
You know, I was waiting for the Beatles announcement

1047
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,200
The Beatles would finally come to iTunes

1048
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,200
And finally beat digital and legal

1049
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:12,200
And you could get all those great songs again

1050
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,200
They even showed a commercial of one of the

1051
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
I think it was the iPod Nano

1052
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,200
And there was little Beatles logo there

1053
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,200
So I was so sure it was going to happen

1054
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:24,200
I'm sure Yoko decided against it, whatever

1055
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,200
But I think it's effectively, this was the chance

1056
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
I don't think they can wait much longer

1057
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,200
People who give a crap are going to be dead

1058
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,200
It won't matter anymore

1059
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,200
And all this great music is just not getting out there

1060
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,200
And people aren't hearing about it

1061
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,200
I mean, God forbid, you don't hear this on the radio anymore

1062
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,200
It may be in a couple of stations

1063
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,200
They play a one, you know, they'll play one or two Beatles songs

1064
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,200
But when you listen to all of that

1065
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,200
Well, it's just amazing music

1066
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,200
I mean, amazing

1067
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
So more thoughts for a second about

1068
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:54,200
The No Agenda USA Tour

1069
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,200
I think I know how to do it

1070
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,200
I think we can start the finance

1071
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200
With supporters

1072
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,200
And then we'll literally have the producers determine

1073
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,200
Which direction we go next

1074
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,200
Yeah, we'll track it all

1075
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,200
Do the whole Google Max GPS thing

1076
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,200
And

1077
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,200
Maybe where the support comes from

1078
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,200
Is the direction that we had in

1079
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,200
You know, basically, oh, looks like we got money

1080
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,200
Coming in from the north, let's head that way

1081
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,200
Of course, that means we might be stuck in

1082
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,200
Getmonation, great white north for a long time

1083
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,200
Seeing as big supporters of the show

1084
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,200
And that way, we could probably cover all 50 states eventually

1085
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,200
Just cruising through

1086
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,200
But support from the producers, I love it

1087
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:42,200
Totally the way to go

1088
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,200
I'm going to do some calculations

1089
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,200
I'll find out what one of these no agenda

1090
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,200
Closers are going to cost

1091
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
And there's some good names, you know?

1092
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,200
A good name for the tour

1093
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
No agenda road to nowhere

1094
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,200
Put some freedom in the title, probably

1095
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,200
And we document it

1096
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,200
And then Miss Mickey would make this beautiful book

1097
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,200
Of all the 50 states

1098
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,200
And the freedom fighters

1099
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:18,200
Got to love this song

1100
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,200
And so we got the extended version

1101
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:26,200
The grey set this one to me

1102
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,200
No, I don't think so

1103
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:34,200
Of course, the date was the third of September

1104
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
The date I'll always remember

1105
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:39,200
You saw me

1106
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,200
Cause they're by the date

1107
01:33:41,200 --> 01:34:01,200
They're my dad

1108
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
Yeah

1109
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:08,200
I never got a chance to see you again

1110
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,200
Never heard nothing

1111
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,200
But bad names about you

1112
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,200
Mama, I've been in all you

1113
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,200
To tell me the truth

1114
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,200
Mama just hung a hand and said

1115
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,200
So

1116
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:24,200
Papa was a roller stone

1117
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,200
My son now

1118
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,200
Where ever she laid his hat

1119
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,200
Was his home

1120
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,200
I'm really done

1121
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,200
All of me didn't let me was alone

1122
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,200
Hey, hey, hey

1123
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:41,200
I was a roller stone

1124
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,200
Yeah, wherever he laid his hat

1125
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
Was his home

1126
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
And we didn't go

1127
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:51,200
All of me didn't let me was alone

1128
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,200
Where, hey

1129
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,200
I'm really done

1130
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,200
I'm really done

1131
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,200
I'm really done

1132
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,200
I'm really done

1133
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
I'm really done

1134
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,200
I'm really done

1135
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,200
I'm really done

1136
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,200
I'm really done

1137
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,200
I'm really done

1138
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,200
I'm really done

1139
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,200
I'm really done

1140
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,200
I'm really done

1141
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,200
I'm really done

1142
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,200
I'm really done

1143
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,200
I'm really done

1144
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,200
And mom

1145
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,200
Some man choke going around town

1146
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,200
Saying that Papa had three Judge's

1147
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,200
God, I'm really done

1148
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,200
And a new, the wife

1149
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,200
And very bright

1150
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,200
There's some talk about Papa doing

1151
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,200
Some stone's for preaching

1152
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,200
Talking about saving so days

1153
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,200
Snow Tower having the Legion

1154
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,200
Unity

1155
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:50,960
مل

1156
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,420
stones

1157
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,200
spinning in the name of the Lord

1158
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Mama hung another day to say

1159
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Oh, oh, oh

1160
01:35:59,200 --> 01:35:59,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, so

1161
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,800
My son, wherever he lays, had to work his home

1162
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:10,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1163
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,800
Now listen to me, all over the road, all his home

1164
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,800
Wherever he lays, had to work his home

1165
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:27,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1166
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,800
Now, now, now

1167
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1168
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1169
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:12,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1170
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1171
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:20,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1172
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1173
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:29,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1174
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1175
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1176
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1177
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1178
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1179
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,800
And when he died, all he lived was alone

1180
01:37:46,800 --> 01:38:16,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1181
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:46,800
no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1182
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:54,200
I'm feeling we'd have a really fun spring time. I really really do

1183
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,480
This is starting to take shape. We're going to talk to JCD about it in the morning on

1184
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,240
No agenda of course. We don't really have me

1185
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:06,240
We never had our Friday meeting with the Sir Paul Gertour Lord of the Rings either

1186
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:10,400
So I hope that actually I hope something hopefully happened on email. Maybe I just missed it

1187
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,520
All right time to freak you all out again

1188
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:16,400
Remember this is the soundtrack to my life these are the songs I want to play because it's my birthday

1189
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,480
And I'll cry if I want to

1190
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,480
You

1191
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,400
You

1192
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,400
You

1193
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,400
You

1194
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,400
You

1195
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,400
You

1196
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,400
You

1197
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:59,120
Exactly that is the type of music that makes you happy and that's why we played here on the daily source code. It is the soundtrack to my life

1198
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:06,320
Scott Joplin with the entertainer also featured in the movie the sting featuring Robert Redford great movie

1199
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:11,440
This is one of my mom's favorite movies, so as a tribute to her is why I play that hey, by the way

1200
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:15,440
I think we have the name for the tour. Yes, we've got it without a doubt

1201
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:21,440
Hot pockets across America. That is it and the reason why it's it you guys don't even know this

1202
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,160
Mickey's Pilates trainer

1203
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:34,000
Trains the woman who invented hot pockets and she apparently is really bored right now and this could really invigorate her life

1204
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:42,640
So we can probably get to her and tell her that her company has to sponsor the no agenda hot pockets across America tour

1205
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,640
Yay, let's do it everybody

1206
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,320
I am

1207
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,320
Totally loving that idea

1208
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:57,120
Across America tour everybody two thousand eleven in the morning

1209
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,800
Hot pockets

1210
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440

Let me be all

01:44:44,320 --> 01:45:01,140

Let me let me

1221
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:48,520
I'm getting really excited enough. I don't want to wait until Mark, I want to get this rolling now.

1222
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,520
The Norwegian, the hot pockets across America, to Earth, come into your town.

1223
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,520
I think very much, Ray, Virginia, Beau Horne, he sent that which to me, let me be your lover.

1224
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:10,520
Speaking of being your lover, baby, mind as well roll out some babies and isn't it time?

1225
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:26,520
I think I had on my mind holding you as a warmth that I could never find.

1226
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:35,520
Just trying to decide, I'll stay by your side.

1227
01:47:35,520 --> 01:48:05,520
I don't want to wait, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let

1229
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,240
Trying to decide

1230
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,240
No, no, no, no

1231
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,240
Stay away, I'm sorry

1232
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:40,240
I love you, I don't want to cry

1233
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,240
I just can't find you

1234
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:46,240
This is the question to be going for my life

1235
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,240
Amen

1236
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,240
I can't find you

1237
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,240
Time to blame

1238
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:54,240
I can't find you

1239
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,240
I can't find you

1240
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,240
Time to blame

1241
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,240
I can't find you

1242
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,240
I can't find you

1243
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,240
I can't find you

1244
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,240
I feel a warmth in my heart

1245
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:18,240
And my soul that I never knew

1246
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:22,240
This love of love gives me strength

1247
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:26,240
That I need just to get me through

1248
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,240
I can't find you

1249
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,240
I can't find you

1250
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,240
Just wonder why

1251
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:34,240
I can't find you

1252
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,240
And I want to cry

1253
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,240
I can't find you

1254
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:40,240
I can't find you

1255
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,240
I can't find you

1256
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,240
I can't find you

1257
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,240
I can't find you

1258
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,240
Amen

1259
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,240
Time to blame

1260
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,240
I can't find you

1261
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,240
I'm not a time

1262
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,240
I can't find you

1263
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,240
I can't find you

1264
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,240
I can't find you

1265
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,240
Really

1266
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:02,240
I can't find you

1267
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,240
I can't find you

1268
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,240
Yes

1269
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:04,580
Even my guitar

1270
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:06,240
Yes

1271
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:07,240
I can't find you

1272
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,220
Me and my writing

1273
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:11,520
I can't find you

1274
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,740
Staying

1275
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:14,240
I can't find you

1276
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,240
I can't find you

1277
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:20,240
I can't find you

1278
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:22,240
I can't find you

1279
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:50,680
Uh, there he's always gone up a

1280
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:55,680
four, five, playing soundtrack to my life, all the songs that I want to play for

1281
01:50:55,680 --> 01:51:00,680
once. This is not a collaborative effort, and I think we should just roll this one out for a second.

1282
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:05,680
I just want to hear everyone say it. Come on, chat room, I want you to say it.

1283
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:50,680
One, two, three, four, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play

We have to grasp!

01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:58,680
Yeah!

1295
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:07,680
Yeah!

1296
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:11,680
I'm working hard, you're working too!

1297
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:16,680
We do it every day!

1298
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:20,680
Every minute, I have to work!

1299
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:24,680
I need a minute for you!

1300
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:26,680
Take it and take it out!

1301
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,680
All we know!

1302
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:32,680
Things will fail and run!

1303
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:37,680
You'll attack, I'll turn it down!

1304
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:41,680
If that's leaving you!

1305
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,680
Turn it down!

1306
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,680
The radio!

1307
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:48,680
I need the music!

1308
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:50,680
Give it some more!

1309
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:52,680
Turn it up!

1310
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,680
The radio!

1311
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:56,680
I want to feel it!

1312
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,680
Got to feel it some more!

1313
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,680
I want to feel it!

1314
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,680

I want to feel it!

1316
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,680
I want to say!

1317
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,680
I want to say!

1318
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:12,680
The kind that I want to feel free

1319
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,680
I feel the beat!

1320
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:16,680
I feel the truth!

1321
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:20,680
You're not a play for me!

1322
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:24,680
Take it and take it!

1323
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:25,680
Take it and take it!

1324
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:28,680
Take it and take it!

1325
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:33,680
I don't even know what I want to play!

1326
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:38,680
I hate the sound!

1327
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:40,680
Turn it up!

1328
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,680
The radio!

1329
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,680
I need the music!

1330
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:46,680

Turn it up!

1332
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:50,680
The radio!

1333
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:53,680
I want to feel it!

1334
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:55,680
Got to feel it some more!

1336
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:59,680

01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,680
Take it and take it!

1339
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:34,680
Take it and take it!

1340
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:37,680
Take it and take it!

1341
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:39,680
Take it and take it!

1342
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,680
Turn it up!

1343
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:43,680
The radio!

1344
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,680
I need the music!

1345
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,680

Turn it up!

1347
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,680
The radio!

01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,680
I want to feel it!

1349
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:55,680
I want to feel it!

1350
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:58,680

02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,680
After grass!

1363
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:24,680
Turn up the radio!

1364
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:26,680
I got to tell you, I'm so excited about

1365
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:28,200
about the Noah gender hot pockets,

1366
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:31,440
wheels and heels across America to her 2011.

1367
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:32,760
It's gonna be awesome.

1368
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,880
Tao, man, I can't wait to show Miss Mickey

1369
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,240
this wonderful country we live in.

1370
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:40,400
She needs to taste some moonshine down south.

1371
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,520
He needs to smoke some Maui wawi.

1372
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,680
Him is all kinds of stuff that, oh my God,

1373
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,960
she has no idea what's going on.

1374
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,800
How about a nice Idaho potato, huh?

1375
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:48,640
How about that?

1376
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,960
I mean, she has, she's only been in cities, man.

1377
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:52,520
And we're gonna document this thing too.

1378
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:55,720
And she's, imagine the photo book she'll make.

1379
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:57,120
Which, of course, I know she'll turn right around

1380
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:59,280
and sell them to benefit the show.

1381
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,720
That's awesome.

1382
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,320
I tweeted something earlier this week

1383
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,320
that I definitely wanted to share with you guys.

1384
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:07,120
I think it comes from the way the people will not be

1385
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:08,440
scanned.com.

1386
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,680
It's just hold areas.

1387
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:10,840
It's an infomercial.

1388
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:13,000
Check this out about a new problem.

1389
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,400
Vince here for the scan wow, the new generation

1390
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,440
and airport body scanning technology.

1391
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,040
Are you stressed overwhelmed?

1392
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:21,000
Can't sleep because you're flying out on business?

1393
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,880
And we all go inside those nigger body skins at the airport.

1394
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,600
But your body image will be retained

1395
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,680
by the transportation security administration,

1396
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:29,680
terrified your embarrassing naked image.

1397
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,360
Might find itself on a pirate bay,

1398
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,960
downloaded it, worked by colleagues and perverts.

1399
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,840
Don't cry if it's stupid, baby.

1400
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,080
I know you're scared of terrorism

1401
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:38,640
and you're willing to let the government do anything

1402
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:41,400
to keep you safe, but your body is just too disgusting.

1403
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,880
Now, they're scan wow.

1404
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,720
The only naked body scanner that totally invades your privacy

1405
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:49,080
violates your rights, but makes your hilariously fat, ugly body

1406
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,560
look damn fine.

1407
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,920
Which is really the only thing people care about anyway.

1408
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,680
Let's bring out a random tubby fat ass

1409
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:56,000
and show you how it works.

1410
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,160
That thing I'm gonna hurl.

1411
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:04,160
Plus, this fat bastard has a monkey hidden in his pants.

1412
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,920
But with the press of a button, boom, boom, wow,

1413
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,640
scan wow, made in Germany.

1414
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:10,280
And you know the Germans make good stuff,

1415
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,880
like the Nazi hola with machine,

1416
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:13,800
which was also made by IBM.

1417
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,080
Now, hit control print screen for a screen cap

1418
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:18,040
and upload later for government blackmail

1419
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:19,800
or the enjoyment of internet purverts.

1420
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,480
And don't forget to sneak a camera phone shot

1421
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:22,960
of this ripped scan wow body,

1422
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,600
complete with hidden pants monkeys.

1423
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,720
Not convinced yet?

1424
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,280
How about this upgrade, guys?

1425
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,360
Do you have a tiny penis, a missing ball?

1426
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,320
The scan wow penis expansion pack,

1427
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,800
will augment your private pots

1428
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,360
and fill in your missing gonads.

1429
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,160
A totally free upgrade, if you order now.

1430
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:39,280
Bing, boom, no more embarrassing micro penis.

1431
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,440
What about the ladies?

1432
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:42,480
We'll also throw in the tits wow upgrade

1433
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,440
for a limited time.

1434
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,280
So get your camera phones ready, boys.

1435
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,120
Son of a...

1436
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:50,360
Perfout security official.

1437
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,360
How?

1438
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,360
We're talking boobs.

1439
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:53,360
We're talking butt.

1440
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:54,360
We're talking legs.

1441
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,360
She looks way hotter than that whole

1442
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,360
who kicked my ass in Florida.

1443
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,360
Yes?

1444
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:58,360
I'm a sad little ****.

1445
02:02:58,360 --> 02:02:59,360
Now you might ask yourself,

1446
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:01,360
is the scan wow compatible with

1447
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,360
very chip technology?

1448
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,360
You ask a lot of stupid questions

1449
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:04,360
wasting my valuable time.

1450
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,360
But here's your answer.

1451
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,360
Hell's yeah.

1452
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:08,360
The scan wow, well in the toy people,

1453
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,360
just like a grocery store scanner.

1454
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:12,360
Perfect for totalitarian regimes are

1455
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,360
leading out some versives.

1456
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,360
But we need to order lenie,

1457
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:16,360
they can put a keenie, rent a keenie.

1458
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:17,360
I'm a douchebag.

1459
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,360
Did somebody say kids?

1460
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,360
No?

1461
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,360
Let me camera guy, parents with children are

1462
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,360
rightly concerned.

1463
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:23,360
That images of their little ones

1464
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,360
might end up on some pedophiles computer

1465
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,360
being traded on the inner way.

1466
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:27,360
What a no.

1467
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,360
And get the stash wow.

1468
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:29,360
It adds a mustache to your kid

1469
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:30,360
to make him a her look older.

1470
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,360
I want to stand on the roof

1471
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,360
and say to all my students, hey kids,

1472
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,360
look at my huge ****.

1473
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:36,360
Who cares about the fourth amendment

1474
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,360
and illegal searches?

1475
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,360
I love going through the scanners.

1476
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:40,360
The operators always compliment me.

1477
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:41,360
I love traveling,

1478
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,360
but I love the operator attention even more.

1479
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,360
My scanner footage is all over the

1480
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,360
file sharing sites.

1481
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:48,360
I love how I look with boobs.

1482
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:49,360
Screw liberty and privacy.

1483
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,360
Give me liberty or give me tits.

1484
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,360
Don't worry about flying anymore.

1485
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:54,360
We've got you covered and uncovered.

1486
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:56,360
And more ways than one with the scan wow.

1487
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:58,360
Because a happy, ego-stroke,

1488
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,360
complacent citizenry is the first

1489
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:02,360
step towards consolidating political power.

1490
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:03,360
Or do you scan while today?

1491
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,360
So your citizens will shut the **** up

1492
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,360
and let you govern.

1493
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:14,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1494
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:18,360
Traveled down a road and back again.

1495
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,360
Your heart is true.

1496
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:23,360
You're a pal and a confidence.

1497
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:31,360
I'm not ashamed to say.

1498
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,360
I hope it always will stay this way.

1499
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:37,360
My head is awful.

1500
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:45,360
Just stand up and take a bow.

1501
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,360
And get through a party.

1502
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:52,360
Invited everyone you knew.

1503
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:55,360
Well, you won't see the biggest people

1504
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:58,360
people meet and the car attached.

1505
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:04,360
Would say thank you for being a friend.

1506
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:08,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1507
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:12,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1508
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:23,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1509
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:27,360
If it's a car you lack.

1510
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:31,360
I truly buy you a car lack.

1511
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:40,360
Whatever you need any time of the day or night.

1512
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:44,360
I'm not ashamed to say.

1513
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:48,360
I hope it always will stay this way.

1514
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,360
My head is awful.

1515
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:57,360
Just stand up and take a bow.

1516
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:01,360
And when we both get older.

1517
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:06,360
We're walking peace and hair away.

1518
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:10,360
I'm gonna be here even though it's hard to hear.

1519
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:12,360
I will stand with no sense.

1520
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:15,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1521
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,360
Thank you.

1522
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:20,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1523
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:21,360
Thank you.

1524
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1525
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,860
Thank you.

1526
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:29,860
Thank you for being a friend.

1527
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:31,860
I wanna thank you.

1528
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,860
Let me tell you about oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, thank you.

02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:36,860
Thank you for being a friend.

1530
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:38,860
I wanna thank you.

1531
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:41,860
Thank you for being a friend.

1532
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,360
Thank you.

1533
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:47,360
Thank you for being a friend.

1534
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:51,360
And me now.

1535
02:06:51,360 --> 02:07:04,360
And come away, into the night, for milking it

1536
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:13,360
You'll be gone as we live

1537
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:21,360
As we live, then once again

1538
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:25,360
Thank you for being a

1539
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:48,360

Thank you for being a friend

1543
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:00,360
People that maintain bottom high

1544
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:03,360
I want to thank you for being a friend

1545
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:08,360

Oh yeah, it's a sad state of affairs

1548
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,360
When you play a song like this

1549
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:25,360
From Andrew Gold, thank you for being a friend

1550
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:27,360
And the chat room pipes up and says

1551
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,360
Oh, isn't that the song from the Golden Girls?

1552
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:32,360
Geez, Louise

1553
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:35,360
They're making a sick

1554
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,360
It's one of the bars

1555
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,360
Speaking of good friends

1556
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:43,360

Hello, Adam, we've got to be carry

1562
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:00,360
Here is CSB, your correspondents

1563
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:03,360
So you are Americano and I am Euro

1564
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:05,360
And we have some differences

1565
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,360
But we must agree on one

1566
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:09,360
Three movement of hookers must be good

1567
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,360
Yes, so in certain countries in Europe

1568
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:14,360
Prosecutes from east parts of Europe

1569
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:16,360
At a stamp in passports

1570
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:20,360
With prohibition of entry to some west parts of Europe

1571
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,360
Because there are hookers

1572
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,360
But now you do the freedom of movements

1573
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,360
Basically you allow

1574
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:28,360
This prohibition for hookers is not legal

1575
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:33,360
It means they can enter those forbidden previously countries again

1576
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,360
Oh, good

1577
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:35,360
Why?

1578
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:39,360
Well, because prostitution according to latest rule

1579
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:42,360
ruling of judges cannot be considered as

1580
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:45,360
And the enjoyment of public safety

1581
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,360
Correct

1582
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:48,360
The judges didn't say

1583
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:50,360
However, if it is a rubbery dependence

1584
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:52,360
Yo

1585
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:55,360
CSB, no reason to the voice man

1586
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:58,360
Really, you don't have to exaggerate it

1587
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,360
It's good enough as it is

1588
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,360
And let's all say it together now

1589
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:03,360
Yo

1590
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,360
And a glow

1591
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,360
Though the swingers are swinging

1592
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:31,360
To Pepsi

1593
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,360
Please swing out

1594
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:36,360
Those that Pepsi is hit

1595
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:40,360
Each bell ring

1596
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:42,360
Calls it a real ring

1597
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,360
A thing I saw at you

1598
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,360
I wanna do

1599
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:49,360
What the swing and this people all do

1600
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,360
It's a ball

1601
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,360
Yeah, a breeze

1602
02:10:52,360 --> 02:10:54,360
Simply calm

1603
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:55,360
Pepsi, please

1604
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,360
Simply calm

1605
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:57,360
Then take a sip

1606
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:59,360
And let's beat

1607
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,360
Cause it's true

1608
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:04,360
Yeah, the swingers are swinging

1609
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,360
To Pepsi

1610
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:07,360
The swingers are swinging

1611
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:11,360
Because Pepsi is for shaker's life

1612
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,360
That's the least way to

1613
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,360
That's the least way to

1614
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:15,360
That's the least way to

1615
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,360
That's the least way to

1616
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,360
That's the least way to

1617
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:19,360
That's the least way to

1618
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:21,360
That's the least way to

1619
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:23,360
They fought the longest war in American history

1620
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:28,360
They fought the longest war in American history

1621
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:33,360
In 1965

1622
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:36,360
Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war

1623
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:37,360
But it wasn't

1624
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,360
It was different many ways

1625
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,360
And so were those who did the fighting

1626
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,360
In World War 2

1627
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:45,360
The average age of the combat soldier was 26

1628
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,360

You can try to get on a US military's buttons at the table, or then set them up with anything else with you, lastly, in that sense you're learning.

1662
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:05,360
You want all of South Vietnam, you gotta make lots of total $2,000 to $1,89 soldiers.

Many bets complain of alienation and rage are guilt, so it's time to come to a cycle fast.

1680
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:37,360
Eight to ten years after coming home, almost 800,000 men are still fighting at the Vietnam War.

Remember, that song came out, man?

1696
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,360
We were like, wow!

1697
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:35,360
And I was going to have you shith-backing the day.

1698
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:38,360
But of course, the longest Wars fought now, or most, where N關can MegaKen have gained

1699
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:43,360
in its rank as if they were quite difficult if they were here.

1700
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:46,360
Paul Hardcastle should come back, and do a commercially-elected new version of this.

1701
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:50,800
version of this, but you desperately need it. Now, what do we get, uh, you know, at least

1702
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:57,880
that this came late. I mean, it came. Oh, was it, uh, 15 years after the Vietnam war ended

1703
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:03,160
at least, but at least it was on the radio. What do we get now? Fucking Taylor Swift,

1704
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:08,780
blow me music industry, blow me. Nice image, by the way, Marcus couch put a hot

1705
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:13,240
pockets across America to a map together. Nice. Very nice looking. I noticed that you've

1706
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:17,680
omitted Texas. I think it's very important. We go to Texas, Marcus. I think they will

1707
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:33,400
like the hot pockets there. Hey, Adam, congratulations. 46, huh? Okay. So, um, did I miss something

1708
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:38,520
or do we still have to sing a birthday song? I'm very sorry. Sing for me. Come on, everybody

1709
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:50,880
to know I'm Jenna Jeff. Sing it with me. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy

1710
02:17:50,880 --> 02:18:02,600
birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Well, that's on the really great. Thanks, everybody.

1711
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:08,200
Did you birthday, man? Once a year, we celebrate with stupid hats and plastic placed

1712
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:12,840
in fact that you were able to make the trip around the sun, and the whole clan gathers

1713
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:17,960
rounding gifts on a left to do with found. We let out a joyful sound and sing that stupid song.

1714
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:24,400
Happy birthday. We have you done the matters. Happy birthday. Starting to get better.

1715
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:29,640
Happy birthday. It's got help from now on. Try not to remind yourself your best years

1716
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:37,720
are all possible. Well, we all know that's not through the soundtrack to my life. So, when

1717
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:44,200
you think about the soundtrack to your life from 1964, it's got to be very difficult of course

1718
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:51,800
because, well, when you are a newborn child, the only thing you can do is scream or yell or cry

1719
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:59,080
or whatever. You don't understand anything about music, but man, 1964, there were some great

1720
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:06,520
songs. So, what do you think about the animals? Or the Beatles, Roy Arbison, Elvis Presley,

1721
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:12,520
Chuck Barry, you gotta come up with something. Name a song and I can add it to your list.

1722
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:21,320
Maybe the Kings. Holy big names. I don't know that there's some dreams. We're baby crying out loud.

1723
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:29,560
Oh, whatever. It's your birthday. You've been in anything you want today. It's all about you.

1724
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:33,000
Did you already had some presents at him? Yeah, hot pockets.

1725
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,400
Well, some morning presents. So, I don't know. A candle somewhere.

1726
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:43,240
Okay. Anyway, we have all the chocolate hats around the world. Happy birthday.

1727
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:48,600
And I want to play a song for you. Of course it's this one and of course it's a little weird

1728
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:53,480
when you're gonna play it for yourself. So, give me the opportunity to play this song for you.

1729
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:57,000
I'm gonna wish you all a very nice weekend. Bye now.

1730
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:48,600
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy

1731
02:20:48,600 --> 02:21:18,600
happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy

1732
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:22,600
But it's been a service team

1733
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:26,600
And they just make it become

1734
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:29,600
And we all know everything

1735
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,600
But it's been a tough break

1736
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,600
Orange pieces are also safe

1737
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:35,600
It's my music

1738
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,600
Happy birthday to you

1739
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,600
Happy birthday to you

1740
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,600
Happy birthday

1741
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:46,600
Happy birthday

1742
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:49,600
Happy birthday to you

1743
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:52,600
Happy birthday

1744
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:55,600
One year will never live

1745
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:59,600
A holiday

1746
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:06,600
Well, this is the way you are

1747
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:08,600
You are

1748
02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:12,600
To my heart

1749
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,600
Time is up to you

1750
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:19,600
For people like me I do

1751
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,600
Who know the way you grew

1752
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,600
Is that I'm in the audience

1753
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:29,600
You're all I've got to turn

1754
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,600
You've been a pretty bitch

1755
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:36,600
And the whole day should be spent

1756
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:40,600
And for memories

1757
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:43,600
I've done a soothing night

1758
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,600
But the one is so long before

1759
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:47,600
So let us all begin

1760
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,600
We know it's not too long

1761
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:51,600
But I still hold it

1762
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:53,600
I still love it

1763
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:56,600
It's a happy birthday to you

1764
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:59,600
Happy birthday to you

1765
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:03,600
Happy birthday to you

1766
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,600
Happy birthday to you

1767
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:13,600
Happy birthday to you

1768
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:16,600
Happy birthday to you

1769
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:21,600
Happy birthday to you

1770
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,600
Happy birthday to you

1771
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:27,600
Happy birthday to you

1772
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:31,600
Happy birthday to you

1773
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,600
Happy birthday to you

1774
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:36,600
Happy birthday to you

1775
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:38,600
Happy birthday to you

1776
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:40,600
Happy birthday to you

1777
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:42,600
Happy birthday to you

1778
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,600
Happy birthday to you

1779
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:46,600
Happy birthday to you

1780
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:47,600
Happy birthday to you

1781
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:48,600
Happy birthday to you

1782
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,600
Happy birthday to you

1783
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:51,600
Happy birthday to you

1784
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:52,600
Happy birthday to you

1785
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,600
Happy birthday to you

1786
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,600
Happy birthday to you

1787
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,600
Happy birthday to you

1788
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,600
Happy birthday to you

1789
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:57,600
Happy birthday to you

1790
02:23:57,600 --> 02:23:58,600
Happy birthday to you

1791
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:59,600
Happy birthday to you

1792
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:00,600
Happy birthday to you

1793
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,600
Happy birthday to you

1794
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,600
Happy birthday to me

1795
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,600
Happy birthday to you

1796
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:13,600
Happy birthday to you

1797
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:17,600
Happy birthday to you

1798
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:18,600
Happy birthday to you

1799
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,600
Happy birthday to you

1800
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:26,600
Happy birthday to you

1801
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:29,600
Happy birthday to you

1802
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:35,600
That a month is way too short, we're going to have way too many people to see producers everywhere, I agree.

1803
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:38,600
Totally agree.

1804
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:40,600
I can't wait.

1805
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:44,600
I don't think I can wait until March actually.

1806
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:48,600
Maybe we'll have to gear it up sooner.

1807
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:50,600
Up to you, producers.

1808
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:53,600
Gotta figure out a way to get this roll out.

1809
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:57,600
You walked into the party.

1810
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:01,600
Like you were walking onto a yacht.

1811
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:06,600
Your hat's strategically dipped below one eye.

1812
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:10,600
Your scarf and clothes are gray-cut.

1813
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:15,600
You had one eye in the mirror as.

1814
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:19,600
You watched yourself go about.

1815
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:24,600
And other girls dreamed that they'd be your partner.

1816
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,600
They'd be your partner.

1817
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:30,600
You're also brave.

1818
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:34,600
You probably think this song is about you.

1819
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,600
You're so brave.

1820
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:38,600
You're so brave.

1821
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:41,600
You think this song is about you.

1822
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:44,600
Don't you don't you.

1823
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:45,600
You're so brave.

1824
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:46,600
You're so brave.

1825
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,600
You're so brave.

1826
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:48,600
You're so brave.

1827
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:49,600
You're so brave.

1828
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:50,600
You're so brave.

1829
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:52,600
You're so brave.

1830
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:53,600
You're so brave.

1831
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:54,600
You're so brave.

1832
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:55,600
You're so brave.

1833
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:56,600
You're so brave.

1834
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:57,600
You're so brave.

1835
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,600
You're so brave.

1836
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,600
You're so brave.

1837
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:00,600
You're so brave.

1838
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:01,600
You're so brave.

1839
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,600
You're so brave.

1840
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:03,600
You're so brave.

1841
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:04,600
You're so brave.

1842
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:05,600
You're so brave.

1843
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:06,600
You're so brave.

1844
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:07,600
You're so brave.

1845
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:08,600
You're so brave.

1846
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:09,600
You're so brave.

1847
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:10,600
You're so brave.

1848
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:11,600
You're so brave.

1849
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:12,600
You're so brave.

1850
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:13,600
You're so brave.

1851
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:16,600
You're so brave.

1852
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:17,600
You're so brave.

1853
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:22,600
You're so brave.

1854
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:23,600
You're so brave.

1855
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:24,600
You're so brave.

1856
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:25,600
You're so brave.

1857
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:26,600
You're so brave.

1858
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:27,600
You're so brave.

1859
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:29,600
You're so brave.

1860
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:30,600
You're so brave.

1861
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:31,600
You're so brave.

1862
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:32,600
You're so brave.

1863
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:35,600
You're so brave.

1864
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:36,600
You're so brave.

1865
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:37,600
You're so brave.

1866
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:38,600
You're so brave.

1867
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,600
You're so brave.

1868
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:42,600
You're so brave.

1869
02:26:42,600 --> 02:27:09,600
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee clouds in my coffee

1870
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:16,600
You're so brave You probably think the song is about you

1871
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:23,600
You're so brave I bet you think the song is about you

1872
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:31,600
Don't you go to when I hear you went up the side of yoga

1873
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:39,600
And your horse naturally won, then you blew your lid up the floor of our sculpture

1874
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:49,600
To see the total eclipse of the sun, where you should be all the time

1875
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:55,600
And when you're not, you're with someone who will spy all the way

1876
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:00,600
I follow a close friend, follow a close friend

1877
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:07,600
You're so brave You probably think the song is about you

1878
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:13,600
You're so brave I bet you think the song is about you

1879
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:18,600
Don't you go to don't you

1880
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:22,600
All right, time to get serious on this thing now

1881
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:29,600
I need some research done, what will it cost to rent an appropriate size

1882
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:38,600
Hot mock and mobile, so I can set some targets with support from the producers

1883
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:43,600
I think one of those things a couple hundred bucks a day, I mean they're definitely not cheap

1884
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:48,600
But let's really do this, I'm very very excited about it, I'm telling you

1885
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:53,600
Oh yeah, gotta play this for you

1886
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:58,600
Oh winter's day

1887
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:05,600
In a deep and dark December

1888
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:10,600
I am alone

1889
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:14,600
Gazing from my window, to the streets below

1890
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:18,600
I'm a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow

1891
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:29,600
I am a rock, I am an island

1892
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:33,600
I built walls

1893
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:39,600
I've purchased steep and mighty

1894
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:44,600
But none made men a treat

1895
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:49,600
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain

1896
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:52,600
It's laughter and it's loving, I just think

1897
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:58,600
I am a rock, I am an island

1898
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:05,600
Don't talk of love

1899
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:10,600
Well, I heard the word before

1900
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:16,600
It's leaving in my memory

1901
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:21,600
And I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died

1902
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:24,600
If I never loved, I never would have cried

1903
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:30,600
I am a rock, I am an island

1904
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:38,600
I have my books

1905
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:43,600
And my poetry to protect me

1906
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:49,600
I am shielding my armor

1907
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:53,600
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb

1908
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:56,600
I touch your one and no one touches me

1909
02:30:56,600 --> 02:31:03,600
I am a rock, I am an island

1910
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:09,600
I have a rock and feel no pain

1911
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:14,600
And an island never cries

1912
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:39,600
If I could save time in a bottle

1913
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:44,600
The first thing that I'd like to do

1914
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:47,600
Is to save every day

1915
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:51,600
To eternity passes away

1916
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:55,600
Just to spend them with you

1917
02:31:55,600 --> 02:32:00,600
If I could make days less forever

1918
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:05,600
If words could make wishes come true

1919
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:10,600
I'd save every day like a treasure

1920
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:16,600
And then again I would spend them with you

1921
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:21,600
But then never seems to be enough time to do the things

1922
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:28,600
I want to know once you're either

1923
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:31,600
I've looked around, no of to know

1924
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:39,600
You're the one I want to go through time with you

1925
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:55,600
If I had a box just for wishes

1926
02:32:55,600 --> 02:33:01,600
And dreams that had never come true

1927
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:07,600
The box would be empty except for the memory of how

1928
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:11,600
They were answered by you

1929
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:16,600
But then never seems to be enough time to do the things

1930
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:22,600
I want to know once you're either

1931
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:25,600
I've looked around, no of to know

1932
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:31,600
You're the one I want to go through time

1933
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:42,600
I want to know once you're either

1934
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:47,600
I want to know once you're either

1935
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:50,600
I want to know once you're either

1936
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:53,600
I want to know once you're either

1937
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:55,600
I want to know once you're either

1938
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:57,600
I want to know once you're either

1939
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:58,600
I want to know once you're either

1940
02:33:58,600 --> 02:34:00,600
I want to know once you're either

1941
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:02,600
I want to know once you're either

1942
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:04,600
I want to know once you're either

1943
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:06,600
I want to know once you're either

1944
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:16,600
I want to know twice you're either

1945
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:18,600
I want to know once you're either

1946
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:20,600
I want to know once you're either

1947
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:27,600
I want to know once you're either

1948
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,600
I want to know once you're either

1949
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:33,600
I want to know once you're either

1950
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,600
I was getting so excited

1951
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,600
Star rockets in flight

1952
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:41,600
Captain, you didn't lie

1953
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:43,600
Ooh

1954
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:45,600
Hey

1955
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:47,600
Captain, you didn't lie

1956
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,600
Hey

1957
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,600
Captain, you didn't lie

1958
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:57,600
Started out this morning

1959
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:59,600
And so full light

1960
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:01,600
I always thought it was too long

1961
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:03,600
You called it didn't bite

1962
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:05,600
But you got some been a witness

1963
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:07,600
I think I might never be

1964
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:09,600
Little afternoon delight

1965
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:11,600
Sky rockets in flight

1966
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:15,600
Afternoon delight

1967
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,600
Hey

1968
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,600
Afternoon delight

1969
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:25,600
Hey

1970
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:27,600
Afternoon delight

1971
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,600
Hey

1972
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:43,600
Hey

1973
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:47,600
When I come around

1974
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,600
We can make a lot of love

1975
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:53,600
And for the sun going down

1976
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:55,600
We can always work it up

1977
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:57,600
But every time we can hold

1978
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:59,600
To a little afternoon delight

1979
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:01,600
Love the steps and so's together

1980
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,600
Make a sports ignite

1981
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,600
And the thought of rubbing me

1982
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:07,600
Is getting so excited

1983
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:09,600
Sky rockets in flight

1984
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,600
Afternoon delight

1985
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:13,600

Afternoon delight

1998
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:57,600
I can't be pervy

1999
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:02,600
The way that you make me feel

2000
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:05,600

And it's love with me

2007
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:34,600

02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:06,600
You write everything

2070
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:10,600
You come and take me, take me by the end

2071
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:14,600
I'm in baby, you write everything

2072
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:18,600
You come and take me by the end

2073
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:21,600
I snuck that one and I, you didn't know

2074
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,600
Another thing you never hear on the radio again

2075
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:24,600
Force on to the road

2076
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:27,600
Without any interruption

2077
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:30,600
Without a commercial, without some DJs, yapping away

2078
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:32,600
You don't hear that

2079
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:40,600
Let's get serious about this thing here for a second

2080
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:43,600
Looks like fine, we're getting some people to price out these RVs

2081
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:46,600
Looks like a large RV

2082
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:48,600
I don't know if that one's going to be big enough

2083
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:52,600
I don't know, it has a pull down bed

2084
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:56,600
Is there one size larger than the cruise america.com

2085
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:59,600
Large RV, just doesn't seem like

2086
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:02,600
Is that the biggest they have?

2087
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,600
Maybe it is

2088
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,600
I guess you don't need a special license for it

2089
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:08,600
Let me see what it has here

2090
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:10,600
Sleep 7, we don't need that obviously

2091
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:13,600
But that will be good enough for making myself

2092
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:15,600
So it's a Ford V10

2093
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:19,600
Automatic two wheel drive, power brake, steering, in-air conditioning

2094
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,600
Cruise control

2095
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:23,600
And we need an air conditioning

2096
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:25,600
When we're standing still too

2097
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:28,600
Cruise control, dual rear tires

2098
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:32,600
stereo sound system, electric generator good

2099
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:35,600
55 gallon fuel tank, LPG gas tank

2100
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:39,600
Fresh water tank, water heater tank, sewage tank

2101
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:42,600
We need a big one, I agree

2102
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,600
LPG gas refrigerator, that's good

2103
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:48,600
Cooktop burners, 110 volt microwave oven

2104
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:50,600
For the hot pockets, of course

2105
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:54,600
12 volt furnace, shower, fresh water toilets

2106
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:57,600
I think this actually might do it

2107
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:00,600
It looks like it's going to be, if you take gas into account

2108
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:03,600
Probably like five grand a month

2109
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:07,600
So maybe we need to do some kind of special

2110
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:10,600
I don't know, maybe Sir Paul can come up with some idea

2111
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:13,600
So we can raise some funds specifically for this

2112
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:16,600
I'm very excited about the idea

2113
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:19,600
Make a deal, do you mind if we go before March, let me go earlier?

2114
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:23,600
We can go on October, it means like next month

2115
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:25,600
Yeah

2116
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:28,600
What's that?

2117
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:40,600
I can't turn the noise gate off for some reason, would you say?

2118
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:45,600
We can't stop, we can't stop

2119
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:47,600
No, no

2120
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:49,600
What do you mean, snow is good too?

2121
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:51,600
It's not, what do you think Alaska is?

2122
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,600
Yeah, but it's not cold everywhere

2123
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:57,600
We can go down south, but you'd be willing to go on October

2124
02:44:58,600 --> 02:45:03,600
I got momentum going, there must be somebody who has a friggin uncle

2125
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:06,600
In Florida somewhere who's got a huge RV that we can borrow

2126
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:10,600
I mean, you know, there's gotta be somebody that we can borrow one from

2127
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:13,600
It seems ridiculous to have to go out and rent one

2128
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:17,600
And then, you know, just a little bit of extra support from the producers

2129
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:21,600
But these things are, you know, people never drive in October

2130
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:23,600
They're always driving in the wrong time of the year

2131
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:25,600
So be perfect for us to go

2132
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:28,600
Oh my god, you have no idea who are you going to meet, do you?

2133
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:31,600
You'll get a little taste of that during the Dutch know agenda meeting

2134
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,600
That's going to be a lot of fun

2135
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:35,600
Everybody's more fucked up Shawn to go

2136
02:45:36,600 --> 02:45:41,600
Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and they're tuned up to leave

2137
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:43,600
Because I go berserk

2138
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:46,600
Well, you left me anyhow

2139
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:52,600
And then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind

2140
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:55,600
They're coming to take me away

2141
02:45:56,600 --> 02:45:58,600
They're coming to take me away

2142
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:02,600
To the funny farm, life is beautiful all the time

2143
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:06,600
I would be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coat

2144
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:08,600
And you're coming to take me away

2145
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:13,600
You thought it was a joke and so you left

2146
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:17,600
You left when I had said that you see you wouldn't miss me

2147
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:19,600
Right?

2148
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:21,600
I know you left

2149
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:24,600
I heard you left and left and left and then you left

2150
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:27,600
But now you know I'm other than that

2151
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:30,600
They're coming to take me away

2152
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:33,600
They're coming to take me away

2153
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:35,600
To the happy home

2154
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:38,600
Whichries and flowers and tripping birds and basket

2155
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:41,600
We were so sick and smile and put their thumbs in tow

2156
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:43,600
And they're coming to take me away

2157
02:46:46,600 --> 02:46:48,600
I put your food, I cleaned your house

2158
02:46:48,600 --> 02:46:53,600
And this is how you came back for all my kind-unselfish loving deeds

2159
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:54,600
Huh?

2160
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,600
Will you just want to find you yet

2161
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:01,600
And when they do they'll put you in the ASPCAU range

2162
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:05,600
They're coming to take me away

2163
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:07,600
They're coming to take me away

2164
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:12,600
To the funny farm, life is beautiful all the time

2165
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:16,600
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coat

2166
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:18,600
And they're coming to take me away

2167
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:21,600
To the happy home

2168
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:24,600
Whichries and flowers and tripping birds and basket

2169
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:27,600
We were so sick and smile and put their thumbs in tow

2170
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,600
And they're coming to take me away

2171
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:34,600
To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time

2172
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:37,600
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coat

2173
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:39,600
And they're coming to take me away

2174
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:42,600
To the happy home

2175
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:45,600
Whichries and flowers and tripping birds and basket

2176
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,600
We were so sick and smile

2177
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:49,600
Yeah!

2178
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:03,600
Come on, come on, come on, come on

2179
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:05,600
Not touch me, babe

2180
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:10,600
Can't you see that I am not afraid

2181
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,600
What was that promise that you made

2182
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:19,600
Why won't you tell me what she said

2183
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:23,600
What was that promise that you made

2184
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:28,600
Now I would go to love you

2185
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:33,600
There'll never stop the rain

2186
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:37,600
I'd go to love you

2187
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:41,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2188
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:44,600
For you and life

2189
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:02,600
Come on, come on, come on, come on

2190
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:04,600
Not touch me, babe

2191
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:09,600
Can't you see that I am not afraid

2192
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:13,600
What was that promise that you made

2193
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:18,600
Why won't you tell me what she said

2194
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:22,600
What was that promise that you made

2195
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:28,600
I'd go to love you

2196
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:32,600
There'll never stop the rain

2197
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:36,600
I'd go to love you

2198
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:40,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2199
02:49:40,600 --> 02:49:43,600
For you and I

2200
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:49,600
I'd go to love you

2201
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:54,600
To the stars, all from the rain

2202
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:59,600
I'd go to love you

2203
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:03,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2204
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:06,600
For you and I

2205
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:34,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2206
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:36,600

02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2212
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:49,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2213
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:51,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2214
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:53,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2215
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2216
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:57,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2217
02:50:57,600 --> 02:50:58,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2218
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:00,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2219
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:03,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2220
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:05,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2221
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:07,600
To the sky, all from the sky

2222
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:09,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2223
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:11,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2224
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:13,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2225
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:16,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2226
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:20,600
To the star, all from the sky

2227
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:21,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2228
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2229
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:24,600

To the stars, all from the sky

2232
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:27,600
To the stars, all from the sky

2233
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:32,600
It's not really time you're close to me

2234
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:36,600
The keeps me close to you

2235
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:42,600
Wow, you are home, there I've always dreamed of

2236
02:51:42,600 --> 02:51:45,600
I knew it from the start

2237
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:48,600
I saw your face and that's the layout

2238
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:52,600
Starship of my heart

2239
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:57,600
It's not so much your purpose, I see

2240
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:01,600
It's not the close you were

2241
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:06,600
It's more than special way you look at me

2242
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:10,600
The always keep me there

2243
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:15,600
Wow, you are home, there I've always dreamed of

2244
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:18,600
I knew it from the start

2245
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,600
I saw your face and that's the layout

2246
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:25,600
Starship of my heart

2247
02:52:48,600 --> 02:52:51,600
It's not my heart

2248
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:55,600
You got to listen, my senses, we live

2249
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:59,600
Every time you smile

2250
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:05,600
Wow, you are the woman that I've always dreamed of

2251
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:08,600
I knew it from the start

2252
02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:12,600
I saw your face and that's the layout

2253
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:15,600
Starship of my heart

2254
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:20,600
I remember when we used to make mix tapes

2255
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:24,600
For our great friends, this is exactly what I'm going to do right now

2256
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:26,600
For the next four songs, for Miss Mickey

2257
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:29,600
A mix tape of songs all about how much I love you

2258
02:53:46,600 --> 02:53:50,600
Ever since I met you

2259
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:53,600
Seems I can't forget you

2260
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:57,600
For four of you, it's running through

2261
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:02,600
No matter what my heart

2262
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:06,600
Every time I'm near you

2263
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:09,600
I got better to feed you

2264
02:54:09,600 --> 02:54:14,600
Just touching you, and loving you

2265
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:16,600
Mix everything right

2266
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:18,600
Tell me how you feel

2267
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:20,600
Never you love me

2268
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:23,600
Follow, then can you

2269
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:26,600
Then can you

2270
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:28,600
I never you love me

2271
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:33,600
Follow, then can you

2272
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:35,600
They can you

2273
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:39,600
You

2274
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:43,600
Never I have found you

2275
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:47,600
Never I have found you

2276
02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:49,600
How did I live with that?

2277
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,600
I don't know where you were

2278
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,600
Been to see you

2279
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:55,600
You're all in me

2280
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:57,600
So sad as for me

2281
02:54:57,600 --> 02:54:59,600
Yeah

2282
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:03,600
I'm so darn proud of you

2283
02:55:04,600 --> 02:55:06,600
I want to see you back

2284
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:08,600
See you see you see you

2285
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:10,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2286
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:12,600
You made a run

2287
02:55:12,600 --> 02:55:15,600
But touching my head

2288
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:18,600
Oh, I never you love me

2289
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:20,600
Follow, then can you

2290
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:23,600
You, who then can you

2291
02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:26,600
I never you love me

2292
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:31,600
Follow, then can you

2293
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:37,600
I never you

2294
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:03,600
I never you love me

2295
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:05,600
Follow, then can you

2296
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:07,600
I never you love me

2297
02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:11,600
Follow, then can you

2298
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:13,600
You, then can you

2299
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:17,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh

2300
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:19,600
I never you love me

2301
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:21,600
Follow, then can you

2302
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:23,600
I never you love me

2303
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:26,600
Follow, then can you

2304
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:27,600
I never you love me

2305
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:30,600
Follow, then can you

2306
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:32,600
I never you

2307
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:34,600
Follow, then can you

2308
02:56:34,600 --> 02:56:36,600
I never you love me

2309
02:56:36,600 --> 02:56:38,600
Follow, then can you

2310
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:40,600
I never you

2311
02:56:40,600 --> 02:56:44,600
I have some awesome ideas about the Noah gender hotspots across America road trip

2312
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:46,600
I want to talk about it in a second

2313
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:48,600
But first I do need to continue my mix tape

2314
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:50,600
I got a couple more songs left in me

2315
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:53,600
Oh, my god

2316
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,600
I remember this

2317
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:58,600
Must have been 1982 on decibel radio and Amsterdam

2318
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:02,600
Stacey Latter saw

2319
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:06,600
Great lyric

2320
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:10,600
Great compass orchestra I love it

2321
02:57:10,600 --> 02:57:12,600
I love this

2322
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:14,600
To waste

2323
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:16,600
Jeanne

2324
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:20,600
And lost it all along

2325
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:22,600
Hey, honey

2326
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:26,600
Love all along

2327
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:28,600
To waste

2328
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:30,600
Jeanne

2329
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:34,600
And lost it all along

2330
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:36,600
Hey, honey

2331
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:44,600
To now

2332
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:48,600
We'll never die

2333
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:54,600
So I've been told

2334
02:57:54,600 --> 02:57:56,600
But now

2335
02:57:56,600 --> 02:58:00,600
We'll be happy

2336
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:02,600
You'll go

2337
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:04,600
I'll move

2338
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:12,600
We're music softening

2339
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:16,600
Isn't it so gentle

2340
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:18,600
Honey

2341
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:20,600
I'll know you

2342
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:24,600
He helped me and that's the racial

2343
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:28,600
I thought it was a racial

2344
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:34,600
And then people don't

2345
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:46,600
I'll be so close

2346
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:48,600
To give blood

2347
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:54,600
And then people don't

2348
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:58,600
To be who is the heart

2349
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:00,600
To be who

2350
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:02,600
To be nothing

2351
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:06,600
All is a passion

2352
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:16,600
While I pass the lane

2353
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:20,600
I feel like money

2354
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:28,600
We're music softening

2355
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:32,600
Isn't it so gentle

2356
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:36,600
Honey, I'll know you

2357
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:40,600
He helped me and that's the racial

2358
02:59:40,600 --> 02:59:44,600
I thought it was a racial

2359
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:52,600
And then people don't

2360
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:54,600
I'll be so close

2361
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:56,600
To be who

2362
02:59:56,600 --> 02:59:58,600
To be who

2363
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:00,600
To be who

2364
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:02,600
To be who

2365
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:04,600
To be who

2366
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:06,600
To be who

2367
03:00:06,600 --> 03:00:08,600
To be who

2368
03:00:08,600 --> 03:00:10,600
To be who

2369
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:12,600
To be who

2370
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:14,600
To be who

2371
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:16,600
And last it all

2372
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:18,600
No, no, no

2373
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:20,600
Never

2374
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:22,600
Never

2375
03:00:22,600 --> 03:00:24,600
Never

2376
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:26,600
Never

2377
03:00:26,600 --> 03:00:28,600
Never

2378
03:00:28,600 --> 03:00:30,600
Never

2379
03:00:30,600 --> 03:00:32,600
Never

2380
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:34,600
Never

2381
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:36,600
Never

2382
03:00:36,600 --> 03:00:38,600
Never

2383
03:00:38,600 --> 03:00:40,600
Never

2384
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:41,600
Never

2385
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:53,320
I found love on a two-way street on your daily source code episode eight four five

2386
03:00:53,320 --> 03:00:59,120
we're getting close to actually we're over three hours right now so a couple more

2387
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:02,120
songs before we wrap it up and a little bit of hot pockets across America

2388
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:07,680
to a before we ended up with today just stay tuned it's gonna happen

2389
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:10,240
oils got the hook up

2390
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:39,680
inside

2391
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:27,680
Don't say a word, my virgin child

2392
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:32,680
Just let you in a vision's run wild

2393
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:38,680
The secret is about to unfold

2394
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:43,680
Upstairs before the night's tomorrow

2395
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:48,680
Is at night tonight

2396
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:52,680
It's gonna be all right

2397
03:03:52,680 --> 03:03:55,680
Cause I'm not your girl

2398
03:03:55,680 --> 03:04:00,680
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

2399
03:04:02,680 --> 03:04:07,680
Oh baby

2400
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:12,680
Oh my God

2401
03:04:12,680 --> 03:04:16,680
And what a nd Hunter

2402
03:04:16,680 --> 03:04:19,680
Oh my god

2403
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:23,680
Oh my God, boy, do you feel that I'munnabbed

2404
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:27,680
I wish a son

2405
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:46,640
I love you baby.

2406
03:04:46,640 --> 03:04:51,200
Rod Stewart tonight's the night wrapping up the mixtape portion of the show, and as we get closer

2407
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:55,520
to the conclusion of daily source code, so it's where they sent me the daily source code

2408
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:58,640
for a 45, these snafu Saturday edition.

2409
03:04:58,640 --> 03:05:00,520
I think we're really onto something here.

2410
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:02,320
This is great.

2411
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:06,800
This whole idea of the no agenda tour, the hot pockets across America, and so we have

2412
03:05:06,800 --> 03:05:11,160
Mr. Oil working on possibly an RV that we could use.

2413
03:05:11,160 --> 03:05:15,080
The whole thing is just beautiful that Mickey, this is kind of like the best birthday

2414
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:16,080
present ever.

2415
03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:19,600
She said, you know, if we don't just do it, then we may never do it.

2416
03:05:19,600 --> 03:05:25,200
It'll all just be talking about it, and I think we're both young enough, myself included.

2417
03:05:25,520 --> 03:05:30,880
To do it now, and she's right, you know, if I think actually she was inspired by

2418
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:38,000
jewel, who was on the Chelsea Lately, Chelsea Handler's E-Show, who came on and said, you know,

2419
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,040
I just released my new record, and jewel has a fascinating story.

2420
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:43,040
I really like her.

2421
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:48,800
She was pretty much homeless or most of her youth, and she became a huge superstar.

2422
03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:53,520
But she just released a new album and she and her boyfriend or husband, I think husband decided

2423
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:55,600
to just go on a motorcycle trip, screw it.

2424
03:05:55,600 --> 03:05:59,440
You know, it's like, oh, yes, if she had to, she flew back to do the Emmys or whatever.

2425
03:05:59,440 --> 03:06:04,240
But she said, you know, even though I should be doing promotion, I just want to go take this trip.

2426
03:06:04,240 --> 03:06:05,760
If you don't do it now, you'll never do it.

2427
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:07,280
So this will be great.

2428
03:06:07,280 --> 03:06:08,560
This is the perfect time.

2429
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:10,400
It'll be fantastic for the show.

2430
03:06:11,440 --> 03:06:12,400
Really good for the show.

2431
03:06:12,400 --> 03:06:13,920
It'll be great to meet all the producers.

2432
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:17,040
And I think what we should do is we should organize a Google map.

2433
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:19,200
We need to pinpoint where everybody is.

2434
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:26,240
Because I think the whole point is to see America only as the producers can show it to us locally.

2435
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:30,240
We have producers in every one of the 50 states of these United States.

2436
03:06:30,240 --> 03:06:33,760
So there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to pinpoint a Google map.

2437
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:37,280
And then start to draw out or out so that we can actually travel it.

2438
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:38,800
And it doesn't have to be set in stone.

2439
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:41,040
You know, we could decide to just change course.

2440
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:44,800
As long as somewhere along the line, at least twice a week,

2441
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:47,200
we've got some bandwidth that we can hook into.

2442
03:06:47,200 --> 03:06:50,160
Now, either that's going to be 3G and 4G stuff.

2443
03:06:50,160 --> 03:06:51,920
You know, we'll have a completely loaded up.

2444
03:06:53,360 --> 03:06:54,960
Life and work can continue.

2445
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:57,520
Mickey is a fantastic driver.

2446
03:06:57,520 --> 03:07:03,520
So I can be editing stuff like Big App Show while she's driving to the next destination.

2447
03:07:03,520 --> 03:07:04,640
And I love drive.

2448
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:06,960
And I love, put my, you know, my left foot.

2449
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:09,840
Oh, actually both feet up on the dash have the cruise control rolling.

2450
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:15,920
So maybe, I don't want to prompt anyone who should be doing this.

2451
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:19,600
Oops, hold on a second.

2452
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:22,480
I deleted the wrong, there we go.

2453
03:07:22,480 --> 03:07:26,480
You know, anyone, I guess, you guys in the chat room who are listening.

2454
03:07:26,480 --> 03:07:29,120
Now, I'm sure someone can figure out how to put the Google map together.

2455
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:35,200
And maybe no agenda tours.com, maybe no agenda tour.com should point to that map or something like that.

2456
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:36,480
Let's get this going seriously.

2457
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:39,280
And we need a little bit of extra financing for gas and stuff.

2458
03:07:39,280 --> 03:07:41,040
But it would be great.

2459
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:48,400
And so the production output would of course be the no agenda daily, which would include

2460
03:07:48,400 --> 03:07:55,280
producers and local, a local taste of the United States, get monation at its finest.

2461
03:07:55,920 --> 03:08:02,240
It would, of course, include no agenda from the road, which being in the milieu would get a whole

2462
03:08:02,240 --> 03:08:06,880
bunch of different, different topics going, local news that normally we don't get.

2463
03:08:07,840 --> 03:08:14,320
Some great road music on the daily source code, big app show with all kinds of GPS related apps.

2464
03:08:14,320 --> 03:08:17,360
And, of course, Miss Mickey's excellent photography.

2465
03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:20,400
This is, I'm very excited about this.

2466
03:08:20,400 --> 03:08:28,480
So, here's the song, all I need for you to do is show me the way, which way are we going?

2467
03:08:36,880 --> 03:09:06,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

2468
03:09:06,880 --> 03:09:36,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

2469
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:43,880
Every day I want to show me the way

2470
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:51,880
Man with the sees that you walk the night in the night

2471
03:09:51,880 --> 03:09:55,760
When I get seen no reason

2472
03:09:55,760 --> 03:09:59,380
You're feeling on your nerve

2473
03:09:59,380 --> 03:10:03,000
When someonedrives to call

2474
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,500
You're way out as a bunch

2475
03:10:05,500 --> 03:10:09,980
I'm swimming in the circle

2476
03:10:09,980 --> 03:10:14,980
I'll feel I'm going down

2477
03:10:14,980 --> 03:10:17,980
Let's be a boy

2478
03:10:17,980 --> 03:10:21,980
To play in my pocket

2479
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:24,980
But someone gonna be there

2480
03:10:24,980 --> 03:10:28,980
But I'll feel you all alone

2481
03:10:28,980 --> 03:10:31,980
Hope I'll do

2482
03:10:31,980 --> 03:10:33,980
Show me the way

2483
03:10:33,980 --> 03:10:38,980
Every day I'll want you

2484
03:10:39,980 --> 03:10:42,980
Show me the way

2485
03:10:42,980 --> 03:10:45,980
I'll want you

2486
03:10:45,980 --> 03:10:50,980
There, there, there

2487
03:10:50,980 --> 03:11:20,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2488
03:11:20,980 --> 03:11:28,600
And,迷, this is one thing that we'd share to always be honest with you, it's a rule of art, so I can do it, that one of our

2489
03:11:29,320 --> 03:11:31,940
kids that we can, that they should be pretty pretty.

2490
03:11:32,600 --> 03:11:35,340
So, that's what I think of that point.

2491
03:11:35,540 --> 03:11:41,340
And when my feet got hurt with my breathing system, I want a lot to calm my knees down

2492
03:11:41,340 --> 03:11:43,080
as hell that's how the attack.

2493
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:49,880
I'd go after my baby baby, but if I don't get what I'm my baby, next time I'm

2494
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:51,880
I want you

2495
03:11:51,880 --> 03:11:53,880
I want you

2496
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:55,880
I want you

2497
03:11:55,880 --> 03:11:57,880
I want you

2498
03:11:57,880 --> 03:11:59,880
I want you

2499
03:11:59,880 --> 03:12:03,880
I want you

2500
03:12:03,880 --> 03:12:05,880
I want you

2501
03:12:05,880 --> 03:12:09,880
I want you

2502
03:12:09,880 --> 03:12:15,880
I want you

2503
03:12:15,880 --> 03:12:17,880
I want you

2504
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:19,880
I want you

2505
03:12:21,880 --> 03:12:23,880
I want you

2506
03:12:23,880 --> 03:12:25,880
I want you

2507
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:27,880
I want you

2508
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:29,880
I want you

2509
03:12:29,880 --> 03:12:33,880
I want you

2510
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:37,880
I want you

2511
03:12:37,880 --> 03:12:39,880
There

2512
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:41,880
There

2513
03:12:41,880 --> 03:12:43,880
Oh

2514
03:12:43,880 --> 03:12:45,880
Remember that album, Frampton comes alive

2515
03:12:45,880 --> 03:12:47,880
Far, far, far, far

2516
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:49,880
I want you

2517
03:12:49,880 --> 03:12:51,880
To show me the way

2518
03:12:51,880 --> 03:12:53,880
With an original tour

2519
03:12:53,880 --> 03:12:55,880
Hoppockets across America

2520
03:12:55,880 --> 03:12:57,880
This is going to be epic

2521
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:59,880
I cannot wait for it

2522
03:12:59,880 --> 03:13:01,880
And I think there will be lots of emails

2523
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:03,880
Flying and conversation going

2524
03:13:03,880 --> 03:13:05,880
Of course I'll bring it up

2525
03:13:05,880 --> 03:13:07,880
In the morning, when we will speak

2526
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:09,880
With each other again, my friends

2527
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:11,880
Wow, can you imagine if we did

2528
03:13:11,880 --> 03:13:13,880
Ten, ten, ten from the road?

2529
03:13:13,880 --> 03:13:15,880
How massive would that be?

2530
03:13:15,880 --> 03:13:17,880
And where would it be coming from?

2531
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:19,880
It can absolutely happen

2532
03:13:19,880 --> 03:13:21,880
And let's work on this

2533
03:13:21,880 --> 03:13:23,880
I'm very, very excited

2534
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:25,880
I am, I'm just like, what the hell

2535
03:13:25,880 --> 03:13:27,880
He might as well know kids

2536
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:29,880
No phone, no pool, no pets

2537
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:30,880
Ain't got no cigarettes

2538
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:31,880
That unfortunately is actually true

2539
03:13:31,880 --> 03:13:33,880
Still waiting for my shipment to come in

2540
03:13:33,880 --> 03:13:35,880
From Mr. Oil and others abroad

2541
03:13:35,880 --> 03:13:37,880
I think it's being held back at customs

2542
03:13:37,880 --> 03:13:39,880
So, all right, my friends

2543
03:13:39,880 --> 03:13:41,880
More than three hours

2544
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:43,880
A great charlie, I really enjoyed it

2545
03:13:43,880 --> 03:13:45,880
Of course

2546
03:13:45,880 --> 03:13:47,880
It does wrap up episode 845

2547
03:13:47,880 --> 03:13:49,880
With the daily source code, the snafu, Saturday

2548
03:13:49,880 --> 03:13:51,880
It's my birthday, so fuck you all play

2549
03:13:51,880 --> 03:13:53,880
What I want to addition

2550
03:13:53,880 --> 03:13:55,880
Was produced with the help of hundreds of

2551
03:13:55,880 --> 03:13:57,880
Chuckleheads worldwide

2552
03:13:57,880 --> 03:13:59,880
Rebirthing the art of radio globally

2553
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:01,880
May I live to be 100 each of you 100 in a day

2554
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:03,880
So I never have to see my friends pass away

2555
03:14:03,880 --> 03:14:05,880
Until next time

2556
03:14:05,880 --> 03:14:07,880
Live your life with passion

2557
03:14:07,880 --> 03:14:09,880
As long as it lasts

2558
03:14:09,880 --> 03:14:11,880
Fuck

2559
03:14:11,880 --> 03:14:13,880
That's too soft

2560
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,880
That's too soft

2561
03:14:15,880 --> 03:14:17,880
That's too soft

2562
03:14:17,880 --> 03:14:19,880
That just sucked in it

2563
03:14:19,880 --> 03:14:21,880
Striding in

2564
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:25,880
The fuck is wrong with that

2565
03:14:25,880 --> 03:14:27,880
That totally blows my whole ending

2566
03:14:27,880 --> 03:14:29,880
I don't want to play that song now

2567
03:14:29,880 --> 03:14:35,880
I didn't feel good

2568
03:14:35,880 --> 03:14:37,880
Hmm

2569
03:14:41,880 --> 03:14:45,880
All right try this one on for size then

2570
03:15:05,880 --> 03:15:07,880
All

2571
03:15:07,880 --> 03:15:11,880
Because all of you are best gone

2572
03:15:11,880 --> 03:15:15,880
And your life is feeling much confusion

2573
03:15:15,880 --> 03:15:19,880
Until if this is just an illusion

2574
03:15:19,880 --> 03:15:21,880
And your world around is coming down

2575
03:15:21,880 --> 03:15:23,880
Down

2576
03:15:23,880 --> 03:15:25,880
Down

2577
03:15:25,880 --> 03:15:27,880
Down

2578
03:15:27,880 --> 03:15:29,880
Down

2579
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:31,880
Down

2580
03:15:31,880 --> 03:15:33,880
Down

2581
03:15:33,880 --> 03:15:35,880
Down

2582
03:15:35,880 --> 03:15:37,880
Down

2583
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:41,880
We'll be left at the shelter you

2584
03:15:41,880 --> 03:15:43,880
Down

2585
03:15:43,880 --> 03:15:45,880
Down

2586
03:15:45,880 --> 03:15:49,880
We'll be left at the shelter you

2587
03:15:49,880 --> 03:15:51,880
When you feel hot

2588
03:15:51,880 --> 03:15:53,880
And about to give up

2589
03:15:53,880 --> 03:15:55,880
I'll throw my best

2590
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:57,880
Just a gun

2591
03:15:57,880 --> 03:15:59,880
Just a gun

2592
03:15:59,880 --> 03:16:01,880
And your field world has a long goal

2593
03:16:01,880 --> 03:16:03,880
And your field

2594
03:16:03,880 --> 03:16:07,880
And your field

2595
03:16:07,880 --> 03:16:09,880
And your field

2596
03:16:09,880 --> 03:16:11,880
And your field

2597
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:13,880
And your field

2598
03:16:13,880 --> 03:16:15,880
To our ground

2599
03:16:15,880 --> 03:16:17,880
And our ground

2600
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:21,880
We'll be left at the shelter you

2601
03:16:21,880 --> 03:16:23,880
Down

2602
03:16:23,880 --> 03:16:25,880
Down

2603
03:16:25,880 --> 03:16:27,880
Down

2604
03:16:27,880 --> 03:16:29,880
Down

2605
03:16:29,880 --> 03:16:33,480
And I'll be back

2606
03:16:33,980 --> 03:16:37,280
To tear us and care of what you

2607
03:16:40,280 --> 03:16:43,880
I'll be back

2608
03:16:44,080 --> 03:16:47,080
Do I love to see you?

2609
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:52,080
I'll be back

2610
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:55,680
Do I love to see you?

2611
03:16:55,680 --> 03:16:59,080
I can tell the way you're hanging at it

2612
03:16:59,080 --> 03:17:01,080
And you're the real man

2613
03:17:01,080 --> 03:17:03,080
Not your friend

2614
03:17:03,080 --> 03:17:07,080
And who you tears you to the ground

2615
03:17:07,080 --> 03:17:10,680
But that's not this land to be found

2616
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:12,080
I know what you're thinking

2617
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:13,080
You're a loner

2618
03:17:13,080 --> 03:17:16,080
No matter how you own we're done

2619
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:18,080
We're done

2620
03:17:18,080 --> 03:17:19,080
We're done

2621
03:17:19,080 --> 03:17:20,080
We're done

2622
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:22,080
We're done

2623
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:26,080
Just to go in show

2624
03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:30,080
I'll be back

2625
03:17:30,080 --> 03:17:34,080
Do I love to see you?

2626
03:17:34,080 --> 03:17:38,080
I'll be back

2627
03:17:38,080 --> 03:17:42,080
You can always love me

2628
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:44,080
Can I?

2629
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:46,080
I'll be back
