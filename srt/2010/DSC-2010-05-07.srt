1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 831.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're 16 months to 7 months and showing five lines of time turns.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're not in the city.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're in the middle of life.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I know it's in the stranded.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm testing.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's very scary.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're ready to see.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm ready.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Me.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
All right fellas.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's go.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a full fire front.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's quick and tight.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
All right.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's fun and so.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Really like the one thing.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's interesting.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're getting so scared.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like to tell you everything.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I see.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What do you mean?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a fight.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a matter of fact.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Size.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's red.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's fun.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And the girl in the cold.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's no one ignore.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She thinks she's the passionate one.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's like lightning.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Everybody goes by a thing.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a music one soothing.

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's the old story through me.

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah.

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's a matter of fact.

47
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah.

48
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a kind of tell it to about split.

49
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And the girl in the cold.

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's a fight.

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've already made it until the right level.

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've made it.

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,020
It's a matter of sisteries.

54
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Two male and males.

55
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,340
Come back to fridge, crack, break your nails and leave.

56
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,460
How does that sound?

57
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,140
There's no music at all,

58
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,140
addictive music.

59
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,720
At the Mass, the back of the fridge and crack with your raises.

60
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,580
At some sky!

61
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,800
Now, let's go!

62
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,100
The color is good as everyone's wanted!

63
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,000
You can give you with a week!

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,540
Wake up right!

65
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,700
Come on!

66
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Yeah!

67
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
This is fascinating.

68
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,300
Look at this!

69
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,700
The water 지en.

70
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
It's 8 squats on 9 dips.

71
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I was born in the edge of you

72
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500

Relangement score, dual wear names?

Don't know what it is, but just feel like grab it a whole bunch of tracks of a bytunes that fell right.

Lost strange, so real and hard.

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Think of the tender things that we're working on.

117
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Switching, it may pull us apart.

118
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Wanna laugh, get it in your heart, baby.

00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Don't you try to pretend it's not you.

129

132
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,260
And when you walk on the street

133
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,260
All you walk on is

134
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,260
When you walk on the street

135
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
My favorite part of the record coming up

136
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
And the tension mouse

137
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Turn on your radios

138
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Twist the knob up to it

139
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
I told you I was in a really easy mood today

140
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Simple mind

141
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Don't you forget about me

142
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Interesting to watch

143
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Everyone, yep and away

144
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
The party at no agenda chat.com

145
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,260
Talking about license fees

146
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,260
Hey listen

147
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
You can't get a license fee for this

148
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
You can't make many money on this

149
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
I'm doing this for us

150
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Just so we have a good time

151
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
They want to take away my music

152
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
They want to take away your music

153
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Screw it

154
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
I made all these fuckers millions of dollars

155
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
The first time around

156
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,260
I think they owe me I can share with a couple of my closest friends

157
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
All right

158
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Time to show up and play a more hands

159
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Remember this one

160
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm telling you

161
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
I too made a bundle off of me

162
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Is you

163
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,260
Seems to be that life is imitating our days

164
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,260
As the bank buildings burning grease

165
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
We're nearing the final countdown

166
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Who will be next?

167
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom

168
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
The Netherlands

169
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:48,260
We're leaving together

170
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Let's still get scared

171
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,260
And maybe we'll go back

172
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,260
To burn the truth there

173
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,260
I guess there's no one to leave

174
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
We'll leave it right

175
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
We'll leave it right

176
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,260
We'll never be saved again

177
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,260
It's the final countdown

178
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,260
The final countdown

179
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Oh, the hell is going to be the seedless

180
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,260
And still we stand tall

181
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,260
To bury the seedless

182
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,260
And welcome, a star

183
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,260
With so many light secrets to go

184
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,260
And these could be found

185
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,260
I saw what we had before

186
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Oh, the final countdown

187
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,260
The final countdown

188
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,260
The final countdown

189
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Oh, the hell

190
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Oh, the hell

191
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Oh, the hell

192
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Oh, the hell

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,260
Oh, the hell

194
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,260
Oh, the hell

195
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Oh, the hell

196
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,260
Oh, the hell

197
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,260
It's the final countdown

198
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,260
The final countdown

199
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,260
The final countdown

200
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:51,260

201
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Oh, the hell

202
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,260
It's the final countdown

203
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,260
We'll leave it together

204
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Well, we know what I'm doing these days

205
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
We gotta worry

206
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Or kinda wonder what joy the boys are doing

207
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
What they look like

208
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,260
You're, and it is indeed the final countdown

209
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260

212
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
What the hell you're doing if you're working

213
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
You gotta quit, it is Friday

214
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:41,260

215
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
That we shared together

216
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Got so many comments about it

217
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,260
So you gotta roll it out for you one more time

218
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260

224
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260

226
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260

Technology wise

320
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,260
Now I'm sauna table cripped out

321
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260

322
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Television telephone

323
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
And the Internet

324
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Triple Play

325
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,460
Triple fail as someone said in the chat room earlier

326
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,780
Got a lot of that so in one less reason favorite color on the football front finish of the Charlie

327
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,180
Yeah, maybe you can tell I I watched them moving the other day

328
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,980
I would be disappointed when they find out the love that song

329
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,060
Yeah, I watched movie the other day called pirate radio, which of course historically is very

330
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,460
Incorrect it's about the pirate ships off in the north sea who broadcast to

331
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,820
Mainland Europe in the United Kingdom in the sixties and early seventies

332
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,100
I and although at historically was really incorrect there was some pretty good acting the DJ stuff was yeah, it was okay

333
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,580
But it really did spark a fire in me once again, you know these I ran my own pirate radio days

334
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,620
Which came right after that and I'm like yeah, the stuff that we're doing here on the daily source code

335
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,340
It's kind of like pirate radio it really is and by the way back in the day

336
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,700
They don't have to worry about Askab be am I and all that crap

337
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,460
I'm not gonna worry about it now either I paid for the songs I paid a dollar 29 fridge of these tracks. I hope you enjoy it

338
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,140

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
And what the every day

364
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,860
I want to rock and roll

365
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,460
All night

366
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,460
And what the every day

367
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Yeah people saying you'll be mine for a while

368
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,460
You're looking fancy and I like your smile

369
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
You try to smile

370
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
We'll drop you crazy

371
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,460
Yeah

372
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
You show us everything you've got

373
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,460
We'll believe that's what I'm not

374
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
And you drop us wow

375
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
We'll drop you crazy

376
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,460
You keep on shouting you keep on shouting

377
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,460
I want to rock and roll all night

378
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,460
I want to rock and roll all night

379
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,900
I want to rock and roll all night

380
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,780
I want to rock and roll all night

381
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,940
I want to rock and roll all night

382
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
I want to, yes

383
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:13,700
The ride to the airways is landed and he's sounding good to me.

384
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,700
This is the Daily Source Code with Adam Curry.

385
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Alright, it's the Trifectown.

386
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Played this one for the candy man up there in Finland.

387
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
I know he gets off on this.

388
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Death.

389
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Crank it up.

390
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Talk to him on dance where you got some rush on your fiery radio.

391
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
I'm the stream.

392
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,700
No one's in the stream dark time with a full body of the Daily Source Code.

393
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Be careful day with the friendly voice,

394
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,700
I can't tell you not enough truth to him.

395
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Played that so much so we lose and I'm the magic you took me to your moment.

396
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,700
I want you way in the open room.

397
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

398
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,700
But this baby never lingers on the mountain top.

399
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,700
I'm taking your hands on the top.

400
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

401
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

402
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

403
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

404
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

405
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

406
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

407
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

408
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

409
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

410
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

411
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

412
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

413
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

414
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

415
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

416
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

417
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

418
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,700
You never imagined you'd get to your fingers.

419
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I wish I could see you

420
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,700
I wish I could see you

421
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,700
It's all the parts were written on the step of your wall

422
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Got them all

423
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,700
I know that goes from where the sound of salesman

424
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Salesman

425
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Truly the spirit of radio rush

426
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,700
On the source code for all you chuckle head that appreciate it

427
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,700
And we had to kind of a football weekman who is weird

428
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Right after Thursdays

429
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,700
There's no agenda the Marcus tanks

430
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Dow Jones dropped over a thousand points

431
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,700
And of course we have some thoughts just to why that happened

432
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,700
We'll be talking about that in the morning on Sunday during the early service

433
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
But while that was

434
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Apparently it started with some

435
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Trader in Chicago

436
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,700
And I would say you want to look more towards the high frequency trades

437
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
And some malicious code that was out there

438
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Or first I'll be spewing my theories on you during no agenda

439
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,700
But let's talk about Chicago back in the day

440
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
And talk about it still

441
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
When I'm a name of football

442
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Trader make that turn his own

443
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
And he called his place for

444
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
With the forces of the law

445
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
I hit my mom

446
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
I would raise the night Chicago die

447
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Brother one and I'd be the one

448
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Brother what if I'd be the one

449
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
hrough you

450
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I hit my mom

451
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Run the night Chicago die

452
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Brother one and I'd be the one

453
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,000
Brother what if I'd be the one

454
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Under the sound of the battle

455
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
Listen to the oldies

456
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:54,700
to the last of the hook and to end it up all the time

457
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,700
through a shouting in the street on the sound of running feet

458
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,700
and asked some more said about a hundred clubs

459
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,700
I did I heard my mom cry

460
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I did pray that I should go cry

461
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Brother what a night is really was

462
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Brother what a night is really was

463
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,700
I heard my mom cry

464
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,700
I heard praying that I should go cry

465
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Brother what a night is people so

466
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Brother what a night is people so

467
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Brother what a night is people so

468
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Then there was no sound at all

469
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Brother what a night is really was

470
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,500
Brother what a night is building

471
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,700
Brother what a night is people so

472
00:28:49,700 --> 00:29:05,260
Brother what a night is

473
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,700
Brother what a night is people so

474
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,700
It's one of the very first forty-fives I ever owned.

475
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Paper lace.

476
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,700
I can't believe that was the night, too.

477
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,700
The day of Chicago died.

478
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
Remember when songs had a story?

479
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
And they were like three minutes long?

480
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
Yeah, back in the day.

481
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
That's right.

482
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
From the seventies to the eighties and back again,

483
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
down today's football are Friday.

484
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,700
You can't get much more yanky due to the song than this.

485
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Jenner Jenner can I turn to?

486
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
You can't miss something.

487
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
I can hold onto.

488
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,700
I know you're playing fine like the other people.

489
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,700
So you made me number all the way.

490
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,700
And I got to know.

491
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,700
I managed to make you my wish.

492
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Then I don't change all the time.

493
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,700
But they've been found by the United States.

494
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Seven five three hundred.

495
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Six seven five three hundred.

496
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,700
Six seven five three hundred.

497
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Six seven five three hundred.

498
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Six seven nine three hundred.

499
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Jenner Jenner.

500
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
You're the girl for me.

501
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,700
You don't know me but you think I'm so happy.

502
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,700
I tried to call you before, but I love my name.

503
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,700
I try how you've made me turn, but I want to see you.

504
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,700
Jenner can't hold onto.

505
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,700
I just make you my wish.

506
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Then I don't change all the time.

507
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,700
But they've been found by the United States.

508
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Seven five three hundred.

509
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Six seven five three hundred.

510
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,700
Six seven five three hundred.

511
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,700
I've got to know.

512
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,700
I got to know it all the way.

513
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,700
I've got to know it all the way.

514

525
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:33,700
And of course, as George Carlin would say, my shit is my stuff, but of course, your stuff is your shit.

526
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,700
When it's mine, it's stuff and when it's yours, it's shit.

527
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:48,700
And I remember Miss Mickey had to pay almost $2,000 for some bullshit scam that customers pulls to inspect her stuff.

528
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,700
By the way, nothing was inspected as far as we can tell.

529
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
And I only have to pay $85.

530
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I love it.

531
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,700
I guess they didn't see the Japanese machine gun that I'm smuggling into the country.

532
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
I'm hoping they didn't pull it out.

533
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,700
I'm hoping it's still in the box labeled Guitar.

534
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Because I plan on mountain that sucker right here on the deck of the Hilltop Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center.

535
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Oh, yeah.

536
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
The only thing I'm looking for now is a magazine.

537
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,700
If anyone has a magazine for an LMG 99, I'm in the market.

538
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
So I was very sad yesterday.

539
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,700
A lot of you probably saw the blog post.

540
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,700
I made Apple rejected my iPhone app for the second time.

541
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,700
I wish they would just test the whole thing out and not just at the first thing they don't like stop and then reject it.

542
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,700
It would be so much nicer if they did everything.

543
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,700
And because of some network hiccup or something else.

544
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,700
I didn't get through and I was really bummed out.

545
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:55,700
I do highly appreciate everyone posting comments at curry.com and sending the emails and suggestions.

546
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
I do kind of have a plan now.

547
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,700
I'll be resimitting it probably this evening.

548
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,700
And it may get rejected again, but there's a longer term strategy to fix it once and for all.

549
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,700
But I'm still not angry at them because they're right.

550
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
If it failed, it failed.

551
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:17,700
And if that was a network hiccup, then there should be something that tells the user at least what's going on and helps them out.

552
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
And so I've got to work on that.

553
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,700
But man was I was I bummed out.

554
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,700
So I immediately went to the latest iPad app that I have called big oven.

555
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,700
If you've never seen this thing, it's awesome.

556
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
And it really works well on the iPad.

557
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,700
It's one of those apps that just really is made for a big screen.

558
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Cookbook, essentially, with the community, builds it on the back end.

559
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Think of a website.

560
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
It's probably big oven.com.

561
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,700
And made me some spicy, maple salmon.

562
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Let me tell you.

563
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Your pilot of the airways is becoming quite a cook.

564
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Just when you thought it couldn't get any hooky or yes, he flows it out.

565
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,700
There's another one that we remember from the 80s.

566
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I've always wanted to know a girl named Ilyne.

567
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Because we all know the joke, but boy, I would've loved her, said it.

568
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,700
So I've got to work on that.

569
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,700
So I've got to work on that.

570
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,700

I can't get crazy sauce

646
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:55,700
I'll be jealous, I'll give up, I'll be dead

647
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:01,700
I'll be dead, I'll be dead

648
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:09,700
I'll be dead, I'll be dead

649
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,700
I'll be dead, I'll be dead

650
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:22,700
But believe it, it's not me, believe it

651
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Please believe it, I'll be dead

652
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:43,700
So you're my great value, I hate you

653
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,700
Soon, maybe I know what it actually is

654
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,640
But people who tried to follow me

655
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,660
And steal me and pull me apart

656
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,500
Nobody ever beat me down

657
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,300
Charlie agreed with B.n.T. at no original chat.com

658
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,660
Come, yes, this is slap-dissing.

659
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,300
It's slap-dissing.

660
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,780
Say, I know now, I am a bad movie references.

661
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,900

November, Alpha, Shira, and show your love.

667
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,100
And of course, we'll put you on the page there.

668
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,140
It's one of the sustaining producers of the stream,

669
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,380
as we continue to feed it with more and more

670
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,860
great programming for you live 24 hours a day.

671
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,540
And of course, special thanks to everyone

672
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,260
who contributes to the show by sending an ideas, tracks to play.

673
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,140
And as seems to happen, almost every single week,

674
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,060
my good buddy Ray is going to give us a rundown

675
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,660
on what's been happening in get-mown-nation lowlands.

676
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,220
All we want is night is rain.

677
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,220
Game ons, hark, no.

678
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,100
We've got to be a part of us against the name of the game.

679
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,740
Hey Adam, got to tell you, man.

680
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,820
The Dutch population is afraid.

681
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,420
We are scared.

682
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,220
You know, it's a strange week for us in the Netherlands.

683
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,940
After Queen's Day, where everybody's extra-versed and happy,

684
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,340
this last week, we thought a lot about the Second World War.

685
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,900
On May 4th at 8 p.m., Dutch people will take two minutes

686
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,780
of silence to remember the victims of the Second World War,

687
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,380
gave their lives for our freedom.

688
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,820
At 20-hundred hours, my country is still

689
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,580
and frozen for two minutes.

690
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,780
Mr. Renne, nice to see you all this.

691
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Now the time and news are up to done.

692
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,780
Thousands of interested people at the National Remembrance Day

693
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,780
at the Dam Square in Amsterdam started to panic

694
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,780
after the two minutes of silence.

695
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,780
The blasts were here and in the confusion,

696
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,780
many of them started to run away from the scene.

697
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,780
Eventually, they appeared to be a combination of incidents.

698
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,780
First, there was a homeless drunken guy named Adam.

699
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,780
Oh, really?

700
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,780
No.

701
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,780
That's really true.

702
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,780
I started to yell something.

703
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,780
You know, it's not a series of incidents.

704
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,780
It's a co-incidence.

705
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,780
I think not.

706
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,780
By the way, if you haven't seen it yet,

707
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,780
go out and have to post this in the show notes.

708
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,780
A daily source code.com.

709
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:58,780
Princess Maxima, the lovely Argentinian beauty

710
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,780
who will be our future queen in the Gitmonation Lowlands.

711
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,780
In a nice little video montage,

712
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,780
there where she is actually pushing a kid,

713
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,780
holding flowers out of her way,

714
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,780
as she runs away.

715
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Literally pushing this kid to the ground.

716
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,780
Get out of the way, slave!

717
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,780
After that, someone saw a man walking away

718
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,780
from the suitcase, which was left behind.

719
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,780
There also was someone who had become a well.

720
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,780
These all happened.

721
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,780
At the same time, exactly after the two minutes of silence,

722
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,780
hundreds of people started to move

723
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,780
or run away from the crowd.

724
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,780
You could see the panicking in their eyes.

725
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,780
Immediately, the Dutch queen was evacuated

726
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,780
from the dance square.

727
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
There were soldiers with rifles

728
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,780
and lots of lots of police officers.

729
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,780
With their hand on their gun.

730
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,780
Of course, a lot of people were crying

731
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,780
and panicking because they didn't know what was going on.

732
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,780
A couple of minutes later,

733
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,780
the queen came back to the dance square,

734
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,780
to finish the official memorial.

735
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,780
Well, there you have it, my friend.

736
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,780
Now you see how dense we are.

737
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
You know?

738
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,780
Nothing is as reassuring as the words.

739
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,780
The queen is back.

740
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,780
The generation that lived through the second world war

741
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,780
dies slowly.

742
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,780
It also increases the fear

743
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,780
that the war will be forgotten over time.

744
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,780
Well, that's probably what's going to happen.

745
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,780
History has proven that.

746
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,780
And then the next day, on May the 5th,

747
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,780
we celebrate our freedom.

748
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,780
It's liberty day in the Netherlands,

749
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,780
with lots of musical performances

750
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,780
on several liberty pop concerts all over the country.

751
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,780
So, it was a week full of national bonding here.

752
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,780
So, just one more thing before I wrap it up.

753
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,780
Yesterday, the results came out

754
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,780
of the final investigation into the cause of the plane crash

755
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,780
into an open field near the airport's shiphole in the Netherlands.

756
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,780
The main problem was the altitude that didn't work.

757
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,780
The Turkish Airlines crew did not respond

758
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
that adequately enough.

759
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,780
And the air traffic control in the Netherlands

760
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,780
was not entirely in her instructions.

761
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,780
But the report also said that the cause of the crash

762
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,780
at the shiphole last year was the coincidence.

763
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,780
9 people were killed and 18 injured.

764
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Turkish Airlines disagrees with parts of the report

765
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,780
and denies two specific conclusions.

766
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,780
First, the Turkish claims that the fact that the device

767
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,780
is not stable enough would have been

768
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,780
at an altitude of 1,000 feet

769
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,780
not a factor in the cause of this accident.

770
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,780
The council said that the device, according to his information,

771
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,780
should make a new start.

772
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,780
Furthermore, Turkish Airlines disagrees

773
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,780
with the conclusion of the board

774
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,780
that a recovery process after a warning was given

775
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,780
was not well executed.

776
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,780
According to the company, the equipment

777
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,780
responded properly.

778
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,780
The second attempt by the crew was successful

779
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,780
but too late.

780
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,780
So, that's it for this week, Adam.

781
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,780
How's your work going?

782
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,780
3 and 3.

783
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,780
Is that working for you?

784
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,780
That's all for now.

785
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,780
My fellow Chocolates.

786
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,780
I wish you a very nice weekend.

787
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,780
Talk to you later.

788
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,780
You know?

789
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,780
It is so funny.

790
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,780
You asked me to find this.

791
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,780
And all that great.

792
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,780
I'm a realist.

793
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,780
I've been working my best.

794
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
I've been working my best.

795
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,780
I've spent an hour on the treadmill this morning.

796
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,780
I didn't go to school.

797
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,780
Oh yeah.

798
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,780
I've never looked at me.

799
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,780
So let's do work.

800
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,780
I've never looked at me.

801
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,780
I've never looked at me.

802
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,780
I've never looked at me.

803
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,780
So let's do work.

804
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,780
I've never looked at me.

805
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,780
I've never looked at me.

806
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,780
I've never looked at me.

807
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,780
I've never looked at me.

808
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,780
I've never looked at me.

809
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
I've never looked at me.

810
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,780
I've never looked at me.

811
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,780
I've never looked at me.

812
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,780
I've never looked at me.

813
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,780
I've never looked at me.

814
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,780
It all means don't say,

815
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,780
I malice the real,

816
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,780
When the housemates grab the clothes,

817
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,780
then get these spaces with me.

818
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,780
I'd want to live in life like that.

819
00:53:52,780 --> 00:54:07,780
I want to be dysmerised,
