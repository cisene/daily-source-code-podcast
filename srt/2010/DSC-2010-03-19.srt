00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Shara Charley 822

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
For a total of four years and 891 episodes

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The Daily Source Code was slamming from the curry castle

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Recording, recording, recording, recording, recording

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then suddenly

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It stopped

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For one year, six weeks, six days and 13 hours

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Filled the RSS feed, aggregator stock polling, iTunes, froze

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And an audience of hundreds of thousands was left in the con

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He's a man in the nose

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He's a man in the nose

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're in a new decade, a total reboot

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
With a higher bit rate than ever before

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The Source Code is back

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With 16 months and seven months ensuring five nights of time

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The 25th century of radio starts here

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're on the nose

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He's feeding me out alive

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know it's in the strength of her

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
On casting

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's fed him curry

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's trying to rip on the answer for barf

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Quick me down

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The Source Code is back

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was just a five

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When I was five

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Raise a cane, I was feeding you

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Top, change, and now the Morgana's fat

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But the fever's gonna catch

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When the bitch gets back

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If I'm a father, that's all right

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you relax, they're gonna sad tonight

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Bitch, the red, the distortion of dudes

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't hide your feelings

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're gonna find a blue blue blue

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm a weird time, I'm a weird time

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Bad, and you historia the blue

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not F***er the blue

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Killed to tight, not big in brains

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sell a so, stop tonight

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,240
But the night, I don't know what's my God, what's that?

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,280
Oh, it's summer now, and the hair is rimmed, the bills get dry, the way

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a better than you

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,440
It's the way I'm a fool, the fight I do

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, you're a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitch, you're a bitches style, bitch, You're a bitch, you're a bitch, you are a bitch, you shit you, you

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
I do know what's going on

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
All I miss my freaking hell around

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I run around the whole thing

54
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
And let him back

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Let him back

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Let him back

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,240
As right, Shuckle Hands, the bitch is back

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
The source code, Episode 820

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Two of them are brand new location of brand new life

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
And still your old trusty source code

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Man, I've been this nervous in years

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
It's weird

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Loving me here, how I've missed all of you

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Blasting out live on noise and the stream dot com

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,240
And of course, the podcast is see the available at daily source code dot com

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,240
And curry dot com, we're going to be breaking it down today

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,240
But first we've got to celebrate the fact that it's a food bar Friday

68
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Turn up your speakers, let's write turn them out

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
But Shuckle Hands is back

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
And I've got a way new lust for life

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:48,320
Soul

72
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Soul

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
See me lie to my little friend

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
ôt got lost in source code

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
He's so strong

76
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Come on, you're done

77
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Here comes the day

78
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
We're low in dust

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,240
We're about to change

80
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,240
He is one of the most proud days

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,240
He made me want to kill him

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
On the ocean

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
And I've never heard he said

84
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
I've never heard of him

85
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I've never heard of him

86
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Some color

87
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Yes, I'm color

88
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
We're dancing

89
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
We're dancing

90
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
Killin' the time

91
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Checkin'

92
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
When there's a room

93
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I've got

94
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
The truth is

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
I've never heard of him

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I hear it before

97
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I've never heard of him

98
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I've never heard of him

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
I heard of him

100
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
When there's a room

101
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
I've ever heard of him

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Now I've heard of him

103
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
All the enemies

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
All all the enemies

105
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
All the enemies

106
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,200
All the dead

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,240
All the enemies

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
All the dead

109
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
All the enemies

110
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
All the normal enemies

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
All the time

112
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
All the time

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
All the men get hurt

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
All the souls

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
All the soul

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
All the men get hurt

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Always having smiles

118
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
All the piss

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
And the air

120
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
All the에서

121
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,740
All the right

122
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,740
Yeah, I'm sure it's different, I'll set it off, no more beating my friends

123
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,740
I don't beat my friends, I'm a winner in drugs, I'm a winner in drugs

124
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Well, I need to start my life, of course I had it in the ear

125
00:07:50,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Yeah, I'm sure it's different, I'll set it off, no more beating my friends

126
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Yeah, I'm sure it's different, I'll set it off, no more beating my friends

127
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Yeah, I'm sure it's different, I'll set it off, no more beating my friends

128
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Well, I need to start my life, of course I had it in the ear

129
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,240
There's more light

130
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Love, not so long

131
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,240
When I hear bones down in the air

132
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
When I look on the dress

133
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,240
There's nothing she's

134
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
I know it's gonna do a nice practice

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,240
K-Man, where do you get there?

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Lose up, your skin starts into the water

137
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Badger, get in with what's in the water

138
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Oh, no, no, no, no

139
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Where dance, like different times in chickenlands

140
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Well, just don't mind God

141
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Oh, there's nothing I've been in my ear

142
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
And I'm not sure of that

143
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
K-Man, where do you get there?

144
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
How are you?

145
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm not sure about that

146
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm brand new, I'm not sure about it

147
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I gotta tell ya, I got a combination of

148
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
chills and goosebumps all the same time

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
As a daily source code is back on the air

150
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
After a year, a month

151
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Now more than a month, like six weeks, six days

152
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
And what a way to kick it off

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,240
The footballer Friday, the chuckle heads in the chat room

154
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
And no agenda chat.com, of course

155
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
This is now all initiative of the no agenda stream

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
More about that in a bit as

157
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
We still have to complete the opening ceremonies

158
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Of the footballer Friday festivities

159
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
This one thanks to Marcus Kouch, long time chuckle head

160
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
It's K-T-Night, call a toast

161
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
On the Charlie

162
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,240
We watch the cross

163
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,240
From the back-to-crash

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,240
We're waiting for the dream

165
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Inside us of my ears

166
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Like the skulls with spine

167
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,240
We lie in the evil eye

168
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Now awake, or sleep

169
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
We're in way to kick it off

170
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Call a toast, call a toast

171
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
And staring at the street

172
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,240
And all the things you want to be

173
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,240
So what a way to kick it off

174
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Call a toast, call a toast

175
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
So easy to believe

176
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Call a toast

177
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,240
But the only side of the stream

178
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Is the magnitude of the scenes

179
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,240
But no one sees you away

180
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,240
From each side, call a toast

181
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,800
It's so sweet to me and don't

182
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,720
The light which I can't

183
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,120
I can't feel the voice

184
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,160
I can't feel the distance

185
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,560
Not a way

186
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,960
Oh, sleep

187
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,800
What's the way to wake now with

188
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,440
Come with us, come with us

189
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,240
And staring at the streets

190
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,920
All I need to do is take it

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
So I can wake up

192
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,640
Come with us, come with us

193
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
So easy to deceive

194
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,920
What are all the ways

195
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,880
Come with us

196
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,440
When all the world is so fun to us

197
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,000
All the world is come with us

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,800
I will be here

199
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,200
I will be here

200
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,400
What happened to the dream?

201
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,040
What happened to the revolution?

202
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,760
When nothing in the dream

203
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,960
In sanity and our solution

204
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,440
I will be the way

205
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh, my

206
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Not a way

207
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,720
Oh, sleep

208
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,360
Come with us, come with us

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
Just staring at the screen

210
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,240
And all the things you want to do

211
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,960
Come with us, come with us

212
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,720
So easy to believe

213
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,160
What are all the ways

214
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,680
Come with us

215
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,600
I will be here

216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,400
Come with us, come with us

217
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,160
So easy to deceive

218
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,440
What are all the ways

219
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,400
Come with us

220
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,760
What are all the ways

221
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,040
Come with us

222
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,480
All the world is come with us

223
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,680
Oh, sleep

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
Oh, sleep

225
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,320
Oh, sleep

226
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Oh, sleep

227
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,040
This is something I've been wanting to do for years and years

228
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,920
Doing actual show from the sunny Los Angeles

229
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,720
And now my dream has come true

230
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,880
Marcus couch, thank you so much for sending this women for the Charlie

231
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,360
Think they are from Los Angeles, Cage 9

232
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,000
Comotos, which is something I certainly was

233
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
About a year and a half ago

234
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,800
And boy, I owe you guys so much explanation

235
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,040
I need to talk about so much

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,840
Finally, let me just calm down for a second there

237
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,560
That was an awesome start for the weekend

238
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,760
It's a footballer Friday

239
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
Daily source code, which

240
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,920
Maybe one of these days actually will be a daily source code again

241
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,160
So only just call it the source code

242
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
For now at least

243
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
So the last time we spoke was episode 821

244
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,640
This is 822

245
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,160
Just picking right up where we left off

246
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,920
It'll be kind of an interesting experiment

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,000
Mainly to see if all of the feeds pick up if iTunes works again

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,960
I

249
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,400
I don't know if I still need to activate radio, use a land to make some of those feeds work

250
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,920
It'll definitely be on

251
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,600
DailySourceCode.com or dailySourceCode.mevio.com

252
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,240
Curried.com all of those should reactivate

253
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
All by themselves, but you'll never know

254
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,640
It'll be kind of interesting to see what happens

255
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,600
I have not will do a little bit of rejiggering here and there

256
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,920
So

257
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,080
I've rebooted fellow chuckleheads

258
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,240
Completely rebooted a lot of you have heard about what's happened in my life

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,800
You've probably listened to no agenda and you know that there's been some significant changes

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,080
All of which I want to get to today on the show

261
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,520
I'm not quite sure how long it's going to be actually I forgot to start my timer

262
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,520
How long were these shows back in the day? Do we do like half an hour? Do we do?

263
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I can't remember at all

264
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Maybe did like 45 minutes

265
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,440
I just don't remember. That's the beauty of course of of podcasting

266
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,960
Is that it doesn't matter you can start whenever you want you can end whenever you want and boy

267
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,120
I've learned so much about media in general new media

268
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,800
What does work would doesn't work where I think the future is going where I think my future lies

269
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,680
But to understand that first we have to go back to the past a little bit of history

270
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,760
So it was probably about a year and a half ago when I was in a pretty bad place

271
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,360
Actually a really good place in a bad place at the same time

272
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
I was in a bad place because I was

273
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Basically sitting up in the attic all day in

274
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
Well

275
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
If you go all the way back to the curry castle

276
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,560
This is a more or less when podcasting was birthed

277
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,160
And shortly after that I moved to the curry cottage in the United Kingdom

278
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,360
And this was kind of a a personal move as Patricia at the time had

279
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
contracted

280
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,200
a a reasonably mild form of heart disease and she'd always wanted to live in the UK and I picked up the whole family and we moved

281
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Just to get away from the entire media

282
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,600
frenzy that was surrounding us at the time and get monation low lands oops, there's no agenda term for you

283
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
And

284
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,840
I've been through so much together right remember the first three four months

285
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:30,520
I didn't even have an internet connection yet the show was growing. I would record it and go out in my car and upload it in the studio

286
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
A8

287
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,920
Then we moved around and finally wound up in the in the attic at the same time I started a company in of all places Sam from Cisco

288
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,720
Was flying back and forth every couple of weeks staying out there. I had the curry condo

289
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:52,040
You know essentially I would have two lies. I'd wake up in the morning. I'd work on stuff. I'd prep

290
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,520
I'd do a daily source code then I'd

291
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:03,240
Around four o'clock in the afternoon. I'd get on Skype and phone calls and be on with the office until 10 or 11 it was it was pretty crazy

292
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,360
And I also started awakening this is something that we talked about

293
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I believe on episode

294
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I'm gonna say

295
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,800
781. I think it was. Let me see. I actually have it here. I did a little bit of research for the show

296
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Let me see if it was yeah 781 is when I did the big awakening episode

297
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,840
Ooh, there's a this one of the black helicopters coming over now. You guys too early haven't gotten anything yet

298
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,160
I'm right here on the in the hilltop watch shower, which is a pretty much in the flight path of

299
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,720
Many helicopters going down to Robinson the factory, which is in torrents California

300
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,680
So back to the awakening

301
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,440
So I was really in a bad place because I was also smoking like a crazy guy and I'm not talking about cigarettes

302
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,120
I was self medicating to the max

303
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,320
I would pretty much smoke all the time unless I was flying

304
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,680
Which was the crazy thing about it because I you know, it wasn't like I couldn't stop. I just didn't want to stop

305
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,880
It was really

306
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,760
Really helping me feel much better and the show has had a certain twist to it as well

307
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
But then I think it was

308
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,920
Well, it all kind of came at once. It was probably when I was introduced to what

309
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,920
Congressman and Dr. Ron Paul was saying and was doing in

310
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,760
In government that I started to look around and say wait a minute

311
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Everything is fake

312
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Everything on the news is fake

313
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,440
The business I've been in is fake and at the same time we were being really honest with each other on the show

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,120
And it was such a dichotomy it was such a duality that I was I was really I was kind of freaking out

315
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
And then I wrote the

316
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,600
The episode 781 and I really did write a lot of that

317
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,440
Although I actually I listened to it before I started the show

318
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,520
And I was like wow, you know, I could really see where I was and you know what where my mindset was

319
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I was just like whoa, you know, I've basically been

320
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,200
A mainstream media hitman. I've been you know my job has been to entertain the slaves the masses and mean while I'm on

321
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,520
And covering all this stuff. I'm learning about the Lisbon treaty. I'm seeing how the elites of the world have always been in control

322
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
And I've been a total puppet

323
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,160
So of course, I'm not going to play episode 781 for you. You should go and

324
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,320
You can always go and dial put it hate. I'll put that in the show notes. I'll put a link to it

325
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,360
So you can listen to it. However good friend of the Charlie Ray

326
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Known as Ray on the Charlie

327
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,320
Maybe a four and a half five minute version of that show and kind of enhanced and and pulled out the

328
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,240
The main bits. I want to play that for you because that'll really give you an idea of where my head started to go

329
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,960
Just about hmm yeah about five months before we had our temporary interruption of service

330
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Stop it stopped as quickly as it had begun

331
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,360
Four years of conversation that we've been to having as brought me to this point

332
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,120
Many of you may feel the same some may be afraid to speak out and fear of ridicule

333
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,520
Fear not chuckle heads together. We're going to face the future the light that is our destiny

334
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
Welcome to the next level

335
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Welcome to the Awakening

336
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,840
Awakening now. I say it's uh in a six month

337
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,240
Excursion, but the process is actually something's been taking place my entire life

338
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,120
Imagine a world where you wake up one morning only to realize that everything you believe in

339
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:12,040
Functioned entirely differently from the way you're receiving it all of your life a world in fact with a truth as often the direct opposite of your reality

340
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
My story is a pop

341
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:23,720
Three kinds of power the power of our minds the power of rule and the power as in what makes our lights glow and keeps our vehicles moving

342
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,360
Individually collectively these three tones of power all the system of energy

343
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,480
My conclusion is that energy innovation was stifled in lieu of this new black hole that would power the

344
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,880
Generators to create a world of energy and motion based on oil

345
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,040
CD illusion and of course we're final five, but we know this is a trick because of the context of being aware

346
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,640
Then we're watching imagine show take a course you'll instantly be the love like a god or fear like

347
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,760
Like you wake it take a red bill follow the other row down the rabbit hole on mail

348
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,120
The man behind the curtain

349
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,560
We interrupt this program to bring you this new splatter

350
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,840
Media in particular television is a trick. I was a multimedia

351
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,440
I was merely meant to give me a slave entertained until the next commercial break

352
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Creating a reality in our minds

353
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,320
There's a servant of the energy at least a gender man is working a media program

354
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,480
I can create content that will make your brain react in a free-determined manner if you really can't figure out how works

355
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,240
And you understand that it becomes ineffective once you're aware of the code

356
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,040
It can easily be borrowed from executing into your personal super computer brain

357
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,960
That's how the new infinite X of EJ with a podcast can do that

358
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,080
Imagine when people would money to plan for their accomplish

359
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,160
Over the decades it built up an impressive infrastructure

360
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,200
Government

361
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,440
Social and monetary systems that they control entirely all of the continued exploitation of us

362
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,840
This perpetual system however has one fatal flaw

363
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,240
It must continue to grow in order for it to survive

364
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,040
It needs us the slaves to be

365
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,880
Inged into it in order to prosper once our houses cars and other true physical stuff has been

366
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,400
Repossessed there'll be no more meaning to the content of money

367
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Remember that none of this machinery would ever been created at free energy

368
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,600
In the able to everyone I think we are about to discover ourselves thanks to the evolution of our species

369
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,360
I'm certain

370
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,040
Martin A has been the finally pre-programmed to evolve and due to centuries of suppression

371
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,080
The internet was of course the elite's big concoca

372
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
I simply cannot resolve it

373
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,760
Or what design our beautiful body machinery wouldn't have added the real hair bits to our brains to make us

374
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,000
capable of even insisting love bread

375
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:08,520
It can't turn up turn up either way most of your still very much asleep in the reality

376
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,000
Created by the masters that own us many of you are awakening

377
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Seeing the truth lies with it

378
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,040
It's so living too outlanding

379
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,600
The elites where she is creaking under the strain of itself and fear of Earth

380
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,040
It's all about the tiny

381
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,600
She comes from one down and now for us need to be awake prepared to take action

382
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,440
That's actually my role to assist in your awakening and to communicate it's a question learning as I can

383
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
I don't see an argument yet

384
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,040
All right look praise please told ones

385
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,360
The earth probably won't come to the screeching hall

386
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,520
The plain tsunamis are earthquakes and land mass relocation nor do I fear black

387
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,400
How accomplished you know this will need away the stealth of the night

388
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,960
But I served here not gonna rule any of it out before years of prophecy

389
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I

390
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Awakening

391
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Excellent piece of montage done by Ray on the Charlie and I really appreciate it because it was perfect to be able to reset where I'm coming from

392
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,200
So I started to realize things around me and

393
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,520
Maybe at an age as a little bit later than and I would have wished

394
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,320
I had no regrets ever in life, but boy, I wish I would have woken up when I was 30 instead of instead of like 42

395
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,600
And there are three people who've been instrumental for the transformation that I'm going through

396
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,600
And the transformation that I hope to bring a lot of chuckle heads along on the on the ride for

397
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,000
the first one

398
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,800
Interestingly enough is John C. Devorek by the way don't tell him I said all this okay

399
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,360
Let's keep this little secret amongst us chuckle heads please

400
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,920
You know we started out doing this show

401
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,040
Or just about the right the same time I started doing a radio show in the morning in the Netherlands

402
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
And very quickly

403
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,720
I

404
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,760
Discovered that you know this guy was amazing. He was I

405
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,360
I hate to say it because if he hears that he'll ridicule me forever

406
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,960
But he was kind of like a father figure you know and he had a lot of knowledge and and he really didn't care

407
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
He just doesn't care about

408
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,160
bullshit

409
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:25,560
And I was like yeah, I like this guy and I could ask him questions and I could butt heads with him and I could

410
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,120
Throw out crazy ideas and theories and things I've been looking at and investigating

411
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,760
I remember I was still very unsophisticated in reading government documents, etc

412
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
And he really started to

413
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,320
Help me shape the way I thought

414
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,720
And this went on for for several months in the meantime of course

415
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,520
You know I'm still traveling back and forth like a madman all of my money is invested in me vio

416
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,080
Of course, I still have a salary and

417
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
That helped greatly

418
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,200
But everything else pretty much fell by the wayside you know I find myself sitting upstairs in the attic at the curry compound

419
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,720
At all you know all hours of the day just kind of my own little

420
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,080
Yeah, my own the ecosphere if you will

421
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,760
At a certain point I was even producing mevio today for oh gosh like six months straight

422
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,560
Which really blew my creativity out of the water?

423
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,000
You know if if you have to be creative every single day

424
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,400
This is probably the hardest part of producing something daily like the daily source code

425
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,360
Although it's much easier when it's audio because you can just you know say what you're thinking about

426
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,840
And you know there's no visuals to distract

427
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,720
You can really create a an entire theater of the mind which is pretty much the field that I play in

428
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,880
At the same time by the way radio was pretty much dying on the vine

429
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,640
Thanks to roll-ups like clear channel, etc. So I started to see

430
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Yeah new possibilities

431
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,960
But still I was very very stuck I was

432
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,640
Absolutely unhappy and I really couldn't

433
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,840
Really couldn't figure out why and I don't think I actually knew why I didn't think I even knew I was unhappy because all I had to do was just

434
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,600
Say another hit and boy. I loved my weed

435
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
I really loved it and

436
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,720
But the thing is it what it all it really did is is it would

437
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,480
Dumb down the pain or whatever I didn't even know as feeling would bring out the true me so

438
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
In essence it's still the same guy you're here and now

439
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,120
And then another thing happened I met Miss Mickey

440
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,080
Now this happened on we're just coming up on our first anniversary of this meeting on April 3rd

441
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,520
This was one year ago and it was

442
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,000
It's hard to even explain what happened but

443
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,880
When you meet someone and there's a physical moment which was just one kiss after I saw her bookcase

444
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:08,440
And the universe splits open and things start to happen and I laid down the weed and like oh my god

445
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,840
What is going on here? It was like a force of energy electricity had just just thrust me

446
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:23,480
Through the last membrane of whatever was holding me back from a true awakening and that's not just the physical person it's the

447
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
Spiritual person

448
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,280
And the mental connection we made which by the way was not

449
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,600
On the same side of an argument we had when we first met

450
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,920
And then it took me about five months, sorry five weeks

451
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,640
of really

452
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,280
Birthday reburthing myself in a way so yeah, and literally this was the time when I had to swine flu

453
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,200
Yeah, I went through that I couldn't smoke you know as I was completely messed up

454
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
My my head was just out of control

455
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,720
But I was starting to become clear. I was like wow wow that sounds like a Scientology phrase doesn't it's starting to become I was becoming clear

456
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,920
And of course, I'd only had one moment with Mickey and

457
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,560
Had not seen her for the during this entire period of five weeks while I was going through the goo and coming out to the other side of the membrane

458
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
With pieces of it still cling into me

459
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,720
And just the conversations we had

460
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,000
The thoughts that we shared the music that we shared

461
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,880
The ideas outlook on life and she has her own

462
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Interesting story by the way, which hopefully

463
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,400
In the future I shall come on the daily source code and we'll talk about that because we're both pretty much about what's real

464
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,440
And that's really where I want to take the source code from here getting you to authenticity something that it that is

465
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,080
Not full of hype and BS and crap and even on this show sometimes I've fed you that

466
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,520
But that would become that would be more like business models and

467
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:07,400
Other things that we have to talk about oh gosh. I feel like I want to do a show tomorrow just to get into just to get into all these

468
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,600
Am I gonna have enough time to talk to you about everything I want to

469
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
so

470
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,400
After about five weeks of this

471
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,960
Rebirthing process I was in San Francisco. I'd been there for several most of those five weeks and actually had

472
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:30,520
Committed to being out in San Francisco for longer periods of time because you know the economic crash was just starting to happen the company

473
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Really needed me to be around

474
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,760
Unfortunately, I was doing a lot of things that I'm well, I may be good at but that I really are not truthful to what I am

475
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Which is a creative being

476
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,520
I was managing

477
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,560
Managing departments going out on the road doing sales calls, you know jerking

478
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,960
Advertises around really just also unhappiness in a way

479
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,720
Whereas I just I'm I'm doing what I'm should be doing and I've learned fellow chuckleheads

480
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,160
I've been to the mountain top of the financial world

481
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,000
It ain't all what it cracked up to be I'd much rather be

482
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
Creative and happy and poor

483
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Far from that actually

484
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:23,720
But it's a it's a lot more fun and and the fulfillment comes from things on the inside and not from things on the outside boy if I learn that oh my goodness

485
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
So

486
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
I

487
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,120
sent Mickey a an email with a ticket and a hotel reservation in a hotel and a completely different

488
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,400
Part of the city and I said please come to San Francisco

489
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,000
I want to figure out what's going on between the two of us remember that only been one kiss

490
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,560
Nothing else at all not not even hadn't even seen each other physically since then

491
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,080
I said you know what maybe we'll just wind up being really really good friends

492
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,040
Whatever it is please come and we'll figure it out and she did

493
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
and

494
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,560
She had me from hello

495
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,760
We spent a pretty much a week in a hotel room and it was all just talking to each other

496
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Well, there's some other stuff

497
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,480
But it really was just as such a deep connection and you know and it sounds like a cliche

498
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,800
But of course, that's what cliches are all about

499
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
soulmate twin flame

500
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,000
Lost souls reconnection and we really feel like we've known each other for

501
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,200
300 years and we've been searching and

502
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,720
We're good for another 300 and it doesn't happen to a lot of people

503
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,040
But I think that we're one of the fortunate ones that actually have been ripped apart somewhere in some parallel

504
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,000
Universe and have made a quantum leap and have reconnected through just the craziest

505
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,640
I mean it isn't even logical that this would happen and now I'm gonna get to the third person who's been very important in this change

506
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,560
So after I had told Patricia because I really I had after that week in San Francisco

507
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,440
I came back and I had to be honest. I I couldn't hold up any front and I just had to tell her and

508
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,480
You know I got back in the evening and the late afternoon and the next morning

509
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,920
I told her and I said you know here's what's going on and and here's what's was happening and of course

510
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,360
This is a very sad and dramatic and traumatic process that is still ongoing

511
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,440
Because there's a you know when you've been with someone for over two decades as a lot of intertwined

512
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
life

513
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:38,200
Including a beautiful daughter made by the way purely out of love and we've raised her I think pretty well

514
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,080
And she's now 19 and has her own life and by the way, that's another thing I got to deal with

515
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,520
You know, kid doesn't really need me anymore. Yeah, except for money

516
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,000
But you know I got to think back and put to my own

517
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,800
My own life when I was 19. I didn't want I didn't need my parents anymore

518
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,000
But interestingly enough my mom played a quite a quite a big role in all of this that's happened

519
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,000
So I stayed in the house for the week remaining

520
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,680
You have to try to hold Patricia and I stayed in one of the guest bed rooms and

521
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,520
Something amazing happened to me

522
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,920
Now you recall those of you who were charcoal heads who have been with the show for the past

523
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,360
Well for the four years that was on the air and the and the year that it's been off so let's you say the past five years

524
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,280
You went through my mom get in cancer

525
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
through

526
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Most of the ordeal and her passing

527
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:46,520
We shared that together and I know many of you still will probably think of my mom when you see a butterfly float by I still get emails from people who

528
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Say wow, man, I thought of your mom today

529
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,440
But I really

530
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,240
I really hadn't come to terms with that. You know after my mom passed away

531
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:04,520
I pretty much went to San Francisco the week after and spent two weeks in the curry condo and

532
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,120
I really wasn't very good at crying. I don't think I'd really really really cried for

533
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
15 years

534
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,800
And I still really hadn't and my mom had been been gone for for three and and you know

535
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,480
I don't think I'd really dealt with that

536
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,680
And so during this week that I'm in in the house

537
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,560
I'm lying in my bed and I'm completely sober. I'm completely awake

538
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:38,600
And I'm thinking of myself. How is it possible that that this meeting this by chance meeting came about between Mickey and I

539
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,480
And let me just give you some background on that

540
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
I

541
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
flew to see my banker

542
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,680
You know, I think we've talked about her before once a year I'd fly over to Holland in the Delta Sierra

543
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,720
And we'd have a dinner and just kind of catch up

544
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,560
And it was a beautiful day April 3rd. I flew out there and we had a nice

545
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,440
Glass of champagne on the roof of her house and she was going through her own shit by the way

546
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,320
We had dinner to restaurant of her choosing an Amsterdam right near her house on the canal

547
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,120
And after we were you know we'd finished eating we were kind of having dessert. I think maybe a dessert wine

548
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,000
She said hey, why don't I call Mickey and have her come over and join us now

549
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,680
You have to understand that Mickey doesn't really know her

550
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,240
She doesn't really know Mickey other than you know one or two conversations and

551
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,480
This banker fairity is her name actually I believe she mistook

552
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,480
Another client of hers who does know Mickey well

553
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,120
And thought yeah, she was just maybe she was drunk. I don't know she was confused

554
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,000
And so she sent a text message and Mickey received this and thought wow

555
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,680
Well, you know, I don't know. That's interesting. Well, she was in the neighborhood anyway, so she hopped on her bike and

556
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,000
She came by and we had known each other for 10 years, but it never really spoke in more than 10 minutes at that

557
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
And

558
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,120
That's you know, that's kind of where it all started to happen. There's a whole back story to that

559
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,640
But that's for another time

560
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,160
But I really was thinking how crazy is it that we get together by some fluke

561
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,040
And really completely by accident and at that very moment

562
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:29,560
My mom says to me. Yeah, it wasn't easy to pull off, but I did pretty well. Didn't I I'm telling you

563
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,720
I heard my mother speak to me and she was taking credit for pushing the two of us together

564
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,040
And I was I was like what and I started talking back to her and I swear to you

565
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,640
Chuckleheads I had a 30-minute conversation with my mom. She made me write stuff down

566
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,840
Stuff I have to do people I have to look after

567
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,360
Thing and it was it was completely mind boggling

568
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,520
Completely actually I cried like a baby after that but it was just for the first time

569
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,760
I really really connected with my mom after she had passed away should be gone for three years

570
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,720
So I'm a believer in

571
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,720
A lot of things for since that day obviously

572
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:23,480
And my mom has really been very very close to me. I can feel her around me. I can feel her presence

573
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,280
And it's really giving me a very peaceful feeling

574
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:35,240
And it's just really wonderful and it is completely helped me on my way to the next level of wherever

575
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
I'm supposed to be whatever I'm supposed to do

576
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:47,480
So those three people are teaching me to spread my wings and learn how to fly and you're invited along for the ride

577
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:01,400
I'm going to do the distance

578
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,800
I'm going to lie

579
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Stretching to the point of no turning back

580
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,320
Fly away to fancy on a little sweat and feel

581
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,120
Standing in the moon

582
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
My senses real

583
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Feel the stretch

584
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
I'm so sleepy fast

585
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Can I escape

586
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,440
It's irresistible for us

587
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,440
Can't keep my eyes from suddenly sky

588
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,440
You're tongue-tired and twisted just above us

589
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I

590
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Sips for me

591
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
I'll touch my wings

592
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,920
I'll be the one

593
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,880
I thought I thought everything

594
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
What I would get

595
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
To find my way home

596
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,360
I'm late and empty and turned to stone

597
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm so worried tension

598
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
I'm saying to find

599
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,960
I'm just running out of time to try

600
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'm going to keep my eyes from suddenly sky

601
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,640
You're tongue-tired and twisted just above us

602
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,400
Sips for me

603
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,360
I'm going to lie

604
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,400
I'll be the one

605
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
I'll be the one

606
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,520
You're okay

607
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,320
Sips with me

608
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,400
You're okay

609
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,800
You're okay

610
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,360
You're okay

611
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,620
You're okay

612
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,380
Are you adding to the notch?

613
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,620
It's 1100.

614
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,880
Let's make it at home.

615
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,740
And then.

616
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,480
Come on.

617
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:33,740
Round 1.

618
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,400
The boat has all the颍s.

619
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I'm a little brim, I'm a hatey, I'm a baby, I'm dreaming and I'm dead

620
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly

621
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I've come, all my wants is in vain

622
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I trust you, I'm afraid, I'm lonely

623
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,400
There was so much to do for the night

624
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,400
There was no sensation to help you this time

625
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,400
To spend it at a mission

626
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
To take love of this

627
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,400
I'll keep my mind on the side of you side

628
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Turn the time to listen to the sound

629
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,400
I'll keep it on the side of you side

630
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
I'll keep it on the side of you side

631
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Well, nothing like a little bit of flowing to help you learn how to fly

632
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,400
And the source code A22 just joining us on the stream

633
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
And no agenda stream dot com

634
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Welcome

635
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
What should we talk about now?

636
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Yes, probably about what is going to happen with the daily source code

637
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,400
And what's going on, everyone has been in a huge debate

638
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,400
As you're going to be, it's going to be like no agenda without John

639
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Or is it going to be all about technology?

640
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Well, you know what, it's going to be about a whole bunch of things

641
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
As usual, but of course this show started off

642
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,400
Really is just a test to try and get podcasting working

643
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,400
With guys like Andrew Grummet, the iPodder

644
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,400
And later iPodder lemon team

645
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,400
And then it morphed into more like a reality radio type show

646
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,400
And it's been through a number of different changes

647
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
But essentially it's just us, I guess

648
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,400
And the stuff that we're into, the stuff that we're talking about

649
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,400
Of course some of our old friends are still hanging around

650
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,400
And still want to be a part of the show

651
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Which I welcome with open arms

652
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
So let's say hi to a couple of them

653
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
The first one up

654
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Comic strip

655
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Comic strip

656
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Comic strip

657
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
Comic strip

658
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Come on in my European correspondent friend

659
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,400
No other Mickey Carey, you meddling Gringo

660
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Here is Comic strip blogger, your European correspondent

661
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
So nice to hear you again

662
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,400
Nice to hear that he's also called back on the internet

663
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,400
And since the work from agenda is a fracking sick of hand

664
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,400
I think feedback from office like myself will be really healthy to your soul

665
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,400
You know, I have missed you comic strip blogger

666
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Yes, you are healthy from my soul

667
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,400
There's only a few people who push back like you do

668
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
And I love you for it

669
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,400
So what's up with your opinion?

670
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Yeah, what's up?

671
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
You're thinking like Titanic

672
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Yeah, we know we're thinking like the Titanic

673
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
And you're keeping your eye on it for us

674
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
I have to tell you, and I don't want to point

675
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Think as of blame, but let me say this

676
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,400
In the 1970s when Greece and Spain were joining you

677
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,400
They were getting huge money from you

678
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Much, much, much, much, much, much, much

679
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,400
Much, much, much, much more

680
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
The new East European members

681
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
They're joining 2004, we're getting

682
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Since then, and now what?

683
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,400
Slovakia and Slovakia and Slovakia are in euro, euro, zone, euro currency

684
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,400
But they are not bringing it down, it is Greece

685
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
This is bringing it down now

686
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,400
And Spain, soon, ish

687
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
So what is the moral of the story?

688
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Yeah, what is it?

689
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,400
Judices are bad for business

690
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Believe me, emotional preferences are often misleading

691
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,400
You

692
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
You

693
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Oh, CSB, my dear friend, good to have you back

694
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Find him at comicsreadblogger.com

695
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
Not the only person who's come back

696
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
By the way, it got a couple more audio comments

697
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
And of course, the best way to get those two of me

698
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
Send them to Adam at bvo.com

699
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
And let's see if this works

700
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
Hey, yeah, my name is Andy B

701
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
And I'm listening to your show

702
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
From Des Moines, Iowa

703
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
Since about the time that you did a keynote

704
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Around nomdex, I believe that's when that was

705
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Oh, man, I think that was episode 200

706
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Wow, that's quite a while

707
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
I love the warble by the way

708
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
On your recording, that's so authentic

709
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Yeah, it's been a while

710
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
So, I just want to let you know

711
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
I do love the show, I'm glad to see it's back

712
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
I've been missing it

713
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
I do listen to no agenda as well with you and Dvorak

714
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
Which is a good show as well

715
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I mean, I love the commentary between the two of you

716
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
It's pure chemistry

717
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Anyway, I was just wondering what your future plans were for the show

718
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:03,400
And I hope to hear this daily source code going for another couple

719
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
You know, years

720
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
Yeah, that gave me that sense out

721
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
There you go, anyway, good to hear from you

722
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
Thank you very much

723
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Well, you hit the nail right on the head, my friend, Andy B

724
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,400
Because that's really, I think

725
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,400
I hate to use the term, but yeah, the business model of podcasting

726
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
Which we thought would work in the beginning

727
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,400
It's kind of come for a circle, the idea that if you build up a community and audience

728
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,400
And I am and always have been basically in the audience business

729
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Building one, nurturing them, taking feedback, adapting

730
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Then you can actually create

731
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
A little business for yourself

732
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,400
And we went down a wrong path pretty quickly, I feel

733
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,400
And this is nobody's fault per se, it's just the way that things go

734
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,400
And the idea of building a huge network

735
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,400
And having enough scale to sell to large advertisers

736
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,400
Well, it worked out and it didn't work out

737
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
In one way, it's worked out where

738
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,400
MeVIO, formerly known as Pod Show

739
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,400
We probably do about 100 to 150 million video views per month

740
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
And of course, we've more from audio to video in the meantime

741
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,400
And that's enough to actually have some business that you can make profit on with

742
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
Pre-rolls

743
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,400
And that's basically the

744
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,400
It's nothing new, that's the thing that's always bothered me about that

745
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,400
It works because repetition works

746
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
We buy our soap powder by repetition

747
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,400
As long as you hear

748
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,400
Or see the commercial often and often

749
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,400
It has a catchy enough jingle, you're going to remember it

750
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,400
And it works, it's mind control, it's programming

751
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
It's how we vote for presidents, by the way, as well

752
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,400
That's why when you have $800 million like Barack Obama

753
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,400
You're able to become president

754
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
Of course, depends on who's giving me that money

755
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Is to what kind of favors you have to pay back later

756
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,400
But that's a whole different conversation

757
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
So, although it works

758
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
To me creatively, disappointing

759
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
On the other hand

760
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,400
We've got the old Senseo Vulcan mind trick

761
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
That really does work

762
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
You know, you can get people

763
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
We were selling hundreds of Senseo machines

764
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Just based on me burping and people remembering it

765
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,400
And of course, my endorsement that I like the product

766
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
So, we also had me via

767
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,400
We have a pretty large business

768
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,400
It's more than half, I'd say, of the revenue

769
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Of discount codes

770
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
Now, the thing that I don't like about that

771
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,400
Is that it's not all based upon the media

772
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,400
And not necessarily based upon

773
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,400
The audience and community you build up around that media

774
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,400
But more on how good you are

775
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,400
Marketing the codes, to your audience

776
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,400
But also outside of that audience

777
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Which, by the way, also feeds back into more people

778
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
Being an audience member of your programming

779
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,400
As well as the relevance

780
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,400
That your marketing provides

781
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Because you actually do a show

782
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
And just aren't some kind of shield marketer

783
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,400
But then there's all kinds of external factors

784
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
And they're like Google

785
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,400
And, you know, how search terms work

786
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
And oh boy, the big SEO

787
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
I mean, it's all great stuff

788
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
And it all makes money and I'm really happy

789
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
And I'm happy it's functioning

790
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
But creatively, no

791
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
Doesn't do anything for me

792
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Then we stumble upon this no agenda

793
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
And what's been really interesting

794
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Is that John and I have figured out

795
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
That there is a path

796
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,400
And we're on it

797
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
We're a long way from our destination

798
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
But there is a path

799
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
To creating media

800
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Without advertisements

801
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,400
Or at least not the traditional advertisements

802
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
By

803
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Delivering a quality product

804
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
First and foremost

805
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,400
And boy, I think we're doing a pretty good job on that

806
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,400
And then by asking your audience to sustain

807
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
The product

808
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
And if you think about it

809
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
Even when you watch television and how many products

810
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
You're advertised to and

811
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Just think of movies alone

812
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
You've got to go see the movie

813
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
And what kind of money you show out for that

814
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,400
And I think that if we would count up

815
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
The support that we were receiving

816
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
From the no agenda listeners

817
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
You probably

818
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
If it was a one-man show

819
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
So of course we split everything down the middle

820
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,400
And we split the costs etc

821
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
If it was a one-man show

822
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
It probably would be self-sustaining

823
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,400
If you know

824
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
Let's say it was me

825
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
And I was living in Montana

826
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,400
And I didn't buy good-looking clothes

827
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
You know, I could get by

828
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
So the system works

829
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Of course we have to double or triple

830
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
What we're doing now in order to focus on it

831
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Full time

832
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
But part of the promise that I made

833
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Is I'd bring the daily source code back

834
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Because we believe that the no agenda stream

835
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,400
No agenda stream.com

836
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Can become much bigger than the show itself

837
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
The technology is finally gotten to the point

838
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Where we're seeing in-car audio

839
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,400
We're seeing, well, the iPhone apps

840
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Android apps, even some blackberry apps

841
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
That are working great with streaming

842
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
People are listening to our show

843
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Not by the thousands yet

844
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,400
Live the stream is absolutely built in audience

845
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
And it's starting to grow

846
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
And there's a huge gaping hole in media

847
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
A huge one

848
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,400
It's so obvious like I turned a 747 around

849
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
And it's namely that radio has become

850
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Completely commoditized into playlists

851
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,400
And it's not what it's about

852
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
You want someone who is

853
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
Either in your geographic community

854
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
Or in your community of interest

855
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,400
So that you can be

856
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Factual actual talk about things

857
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
Happening at that very moment

858
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
If I was doing a program

859
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
And it was only for Los Angeles right now

860
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
I could look outside and talk about the beautiful weather

861
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
And I could play a beautiful weather

862
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Record and I would we would connect

863
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Much better that's been blown away

864
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
It's been blown up by

865
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
Um

866
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Efforts like clear channel

867
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Who have rolled up all of these stations

868
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Into into one disjockey

869
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Sitting in one market and talking to five

870
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Markets simultaneously in the warning

871
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,400
And it's it's ruined an entire art form

872
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
And it is by the way

873
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Radio arts and sciences

874
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,400
It's not just you know playlists

875
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
That that string your favorite music together

876
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
And by the way the experience of

877
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Last FM

878
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
And Pandora

879
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
And iTunes

880
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
It's all great

881
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
But sometimes you just you need serendipity in your life

882
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
You need someone to play a crazy song

883
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
Or to hook into something that you're thinking about

884
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
To talk about something

885
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
We now have all these instant

886
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Instant feedback loops

887
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
Like the chat room

888
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
Like forums

889
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
And that is

890
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
One of the questions that I'll just answer now

891
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,400
People have been saying oh so what's the business model

892
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Going to be of daily source code

893
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
Well it's a part of

894
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,400
The business that we're building

895
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
The part of no agenda stream

896
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
No agenda stream dot com

897
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,400
And if you want to support it

898
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,400
You can go to devorac.org slash n a s

899
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
Not just n a but n a s for no agenda stream

900
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
And you can become a

901
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
A sustaining producer

902
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
And we're going to get a lot more programming on here

903
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
Besides

904
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Obviously no agenda daily source code

905
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
We have devorac Horowitz on plug

906
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,400
There will be lots more

907
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,400
And that in combination with the

908
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Delayed aspect of podcast

909
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Which all kind of melds into one

910
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
I think we can actually build a real business

911
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,400
With a couple of people

912
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,400
And everyone can take it as an example

913
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
And create whatever they want to

914
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
And build up a small audience

915
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
All you need is

916
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Really 25 to 50,000 who will

917
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Who will support you

918
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
And then you in turn turn around and support other people

919
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
It works and by the way thank

920
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,400
God for PayPal

921
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
They're right in the middle of this

922
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
And those guys are genius

923
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Adam Clark Curry

924
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Born September 3rd

925
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
1964 in Arlington, Virginia

926
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
There's a broad testing

927
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
And internet personality

928
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Well known for his stance

929
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
From 1987 to 1994

930
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,400
As a video jockey

931
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
On the music video channel

932
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
MTV

933
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
In the mid 1990s

934
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Curry was a worldwide web entrepreneur

935
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,400
And one of the first celebrities

936
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,400
To personally create and administer

937
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
A website

938
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
In the 2000s

939
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
He helped pioneer podcasting

940
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
And is often called the pod bother

941
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,400
Because of his efforts

942
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Disappointed fans of Adam Curry's daily source code

943
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
We're left hanging when Curry stopped

944
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,400
Producing the show on February 16, 2009

945
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
But now he's back

946
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,400
Let me hear you a little bit of pot saved music

947
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Shall I? This is best for me

948
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Who's back

949
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
I know

950
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,400
But I thought you said

951
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
Good God

952
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,400
Oh you did

953
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
That never fly

954
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
But anybody

955
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,400
I can watch you quitting

956
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
You got a natural

957
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
I can't take care of somebody

958
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,400
But anybody

959
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
Return something free

960
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
You don't let me

961
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
Won't let you

962
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,400
Can give me the true straw

963
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,400
But even can't watch you clean

964
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,400
You got a new movie

965
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Findin' some damn boring

966
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,400
It's got some big button

967
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
I just made a velvety

968
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
You just won't meet

969
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
I know you got all you need

970
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Whatever

971
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
Okay

972
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
Alone

973
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Those kids are walking

974
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Everybody come naked

975
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Not smoking

976
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
But anybody

977
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
Can watch you clean

978
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,400
You got a natural

979
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
I can't take care of somebody

980
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
Got a new movie

981
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,400
I can't take care of somebody

982
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,400
You got a new movie

983
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
Can give me the true straw

984
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,400
But even can't watch you clean

985
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,400
You got a new movie

986
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
You got a new movie

987
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
You got a new movie

988
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
You got a new movie

989
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
You got a new movie

990
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
You got a new movie

991
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
You got a new movie

992
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
You got a new movie

993
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,400
You got a new movie

994
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
You got a new movie

995
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
You got a new movie

996
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,400
You got a new movie

997
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
You got a new movie

998
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
You got a new movie

999
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,400
You got a new movie

1000
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
You got a new movie

1001
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,400
You got a new movie

1002
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
You got a new movie

1003
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
You got a new movie

1004
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,400
You got a new movie

1005
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
You got a new movie

1006
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,400
You got a new movie

1007
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
You got a new movie

1008
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
You got a new movie

1009
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,400
You got a new movie

1010
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,400
You got a new movie

1011
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:08,480
When I'm the thing I certainly want to do is bring back a lot more pod save music to the

1012
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,480
full.

1013
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,720
That Thorne Lee she is from California and you can find her on the pod save music network

1014
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,720
which I believe for legal reasons has been changed to the music alley dot com but I think

1015
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,920
if you hit pod save music network dot com it still works.

1016
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,440
Don't tell Apple.

1017
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,520
And looking at the chat room, I p-dub, p-duby fence is in there and yes, I agree

1018
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
p-dub.

1019
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,920
I think you were the first person to ever play Beth.

1020
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,400
She sent me a note and alerted me to her brand new tunes on the pod save music network

1021
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,640
and I'm very happy about that.

1022
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,760
She sounds great and now that I'm out of here in Southern California, I can't wait to catch

1023
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,920
one of her shows.

1024
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:09,120
By the way, chat room wondering where the cowbell is, I hate to say it but it's in my

1025
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,080
shit that is on the boat right now coming over from London so I don't have to wait until

1026
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,920
I actually have it back to my possession soon to come.

1027
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:59,080
The first star that I saw last night was a lie who meant this guy but man, they never

1028
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:04,920
made our dreams fly fly.

1029
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:14,720
Here we are now in the forest sky and we're in the way, here we are now in the test

1030
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:30,240
It's way you've spread the way we've been, we're working this garbage which.

1031
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,720
It isn't like you're a black and black woman, but the flavor from the watermelon

1032
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:52,720
Like sweet summer limousine, I've been blinded with my deadby skybar, this town doesn't look the same tonight

1033
01:03:52,720 --> 01:04:01,720
These dreams started singing to me, I don't know where, and all my life are

1034
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:08,720
I don't know that I've ever felt so alive, alive, alive

1035
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:16,720

1038
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:49,720
I want to wake up, kick in the screening, I want to wake up, kick in the screening

1039
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:56,720
I want to know that my heart still will be there, there's a reason, I'm leaving

01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,400
to keep my eyes peeled to curie.com to check it out.

1060
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,320
So welcome back, Daily Source Code,

1061
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,160
along May you live, okay, let's be real,

1062
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,080
John C. Duboric is okay in small bursts,

1063
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,640
but he kinda disrupts the sexy.

1064
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,840
You know what I mean?

1065
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,480
Ah, oh, and G-Baby, I love you.

1066
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,120
Ah, oh, yeah, we gotta get it our sexy back, baby.

1067
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,080
I'm sure we can work on that.

1068
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,520
I'm looking forward to it.

1069
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,320
And I would mind hearing Roger Smalls as well,

1070
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,400
but he's really dropped off the radar entirely.

1071
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,840
So anyway, so what are we gonna talk about

1072
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,480
in the coming weeks?

1073
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,560
I've regained my ability to be reading five books

1074
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,600
at one time, and I'm reading five excellent books

1075
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,280
as we speak, so I'll be working through those with you.

1076
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,600
Tell you about my thoughts, and yeah,

1077
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,720
a lot of business stuff, some technology stuff.

1078
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,640
You know I'm gonna be one of those smocks

1079
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,560
who's gonna stand in line for an iPad,

1080
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,680
you know I just can't help myself.

1081
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,680
Gotta get one.

1082
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,560
All right, we're well into the hour,

1083
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,520
let's wrap it up with one more pot safe tune

1084
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,600
from back in the day.

1085
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,560
Fire ain'ts, only you could make me happy.

1086
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,320
As I look down the risk of

1087
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,320
I love the way that we are.

1088
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,480
It could never go away.

1089
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:26,080
It's just feeling that makes you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1090
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,920
All you could make me happy.

1091
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,200
All you could make me smile.

1092
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,360
All you could make me happy.

1093
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,360
For wild, for wild.

1094
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,360
For wild.

1095
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,360
I find myself against the wall.

1096
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,360
I hear your voice you call it cold.

1097
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,360
Just the name of my school reign.

1098
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,360
As the only explanation.

1099
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,360
All you could make me happy.

1100
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,360
All you could make me smile.

1101
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,360
All you could make me happy.

1102
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,360
For wild, for wild.

1103
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,360
I love the way that we are.

1104
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,360
I love the way that we are.

1105
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,360
I love the way that we are.

1106
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:13,360
I love the way that we are.

1107
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,360
The end of the day is busy.

1108
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,360
So near the end, still I can breathe.

1109
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,360
I need you now, so I can feel you.

1110
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,360
All you could make me smile.

1111
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,360
All you could make me happy.

1112
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,360

All you could make me happy.

1116
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,360
All you could make me happy.

1117
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,360
All you could make me happy.

1118
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,360

Time to determine but there will be another source code.

Stick it in your ear.
