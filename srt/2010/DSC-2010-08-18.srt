00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Adam Curry and Bobby Eden and we are wet. This is Delta Sierra Charlie 841.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're 16 million citizens in showing five nons of time.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The 21st century oil stars here.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're giving a lie.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I know it's in the strength of our podcasting. He's Adam Curry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're riding a camp leader fight.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My goal is to come in us with late night.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Can't believe that my head feels right.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But what I need to make me tired of those girls.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Girls, girls, girls.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll wait and look at you live.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Girls, girls, girls, girls.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dancing, they all know some strength.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Girls, girls, girls.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're lips, big guns.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We're lips, wings, wings, wings.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're through a queen.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm hoping to hear you sing.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, you girls, you're just keeping me free.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We're your best when you're out to be.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Girls, girls, girls.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll see you forever too.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Girls, girls, girls.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Walking in the light night.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And time will tell.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Girls, girls, girls.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We're raising here with the same veil.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Can't you read the news?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're the soul to hold your feet on.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can't know she didn't need it.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let me see my eyes.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm trying to feel good for it.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm just in the toy.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I tell you what girl they're calling me.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll be your forever too.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Just tell me, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You don't want to meet me.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm just in love with you.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm just in love with you.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm just in love with you.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We're the host, there is quiet for God

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but God never needs we never would dance.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
For one man's, I got the foes of another one

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Muscle broke down, which is love

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't scare us, girl

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But the body's shopping the heart

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can't scare us

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Trapped my tears, where I lost my heart

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can't scare us, girl

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's on the chin that I'm in

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And what is weird, right now

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And it's a world where we can bring you

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, no, no, no

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no, no, no

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, no, no

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, no, no, no, no, no

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hell yeah

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do I have a vision life of one?

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Nothing but girls, girls

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Everybody, Watin Denny's source code

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Episode is actually eight, four, two

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I was so flustered starting this off here

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
At the watch tower

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I went back to last Friday

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But no, it's not a footballer Friday

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
It is a wet Wednesday, I'm the Charlie,

68
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,040
as promised, lots of good rock and roll,

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,040
lots of tunes, and we are, oh, here she comes.

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,560
Bobby Eden in the pool, how are you doing, girl?

71
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,600
Very good.

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Oh my goodness.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah, well, yes.

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,960
We, uh, there's something with the wireless mic,

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,320
it's a little funky, but we decided not to do the hot tub today

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
because it's like, it was like 95 degrees here in Los Angeles.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Yeah, it's really, really hot.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,480
So we're in the pool, we've got the wireless mic set up,

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,080
we've got some laptops, uh, just to use the towel, Bobby.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
So, um, you know, so you don't put your wet hands on the, uh,

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
on the keyboard.

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
Oh, I think it's your hair.

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,600
But it's that's supposed to mean, you don't want to use my hair

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,280
to dry anything.

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,280
Well, actually, that's the thought there, as long as Miss Mickey's

86
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
not looking.

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,360
So Bobby, what the hell are you doing in Los Angeles?

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,480
Does it have a great vacation?

89
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Yeah, how long have you been in the States now?

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,040
Because I know you've, you've been traveling, you've been around,

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
you've been doing all kinds of stuff.

92
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,920
I know.

93
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,960
I've been here now for five weeks, yeah, five or six weeks.

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
Wow.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,920
And two more to go.

96
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,600
And any work or just, uh, just pure vacation?

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Just holiday and I do all my cam shows because I can't stay away

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,720
for my computer.

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Yeah.

100
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Yeah, the way to make it say, do you do those on, on Dutch time now?

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,800
Uh, or, when do you, when do you do?

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,560
I do, I just want to be doing show right now.

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,080
Yes, I actually was supposed to do a show right now.

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Oh, no.

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,640
So you're, you're actually giving up your valuable cam show time for, uh,

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
I did one before I came here.

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,040
Oh, really? Did you tell everyone that you were going to be over here?

108
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,520
Yes.

109
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
Oh, thank you.

110
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,800
She's in the pool.

111
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Ha ha ha.

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,640
Yeah, yeah, that's funny.

113
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,440
I like it.

114
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
I like it.

115
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,120
Wow, well, Bobby, you, um, you brought along a whole bunch of music.

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,240
And I definitely want to talk about, uh, you know, what you're up to.

117
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,520
And I know that some, maybe some stuff that some exciting news,

118
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,680
you can, uh, talk to us about.

119
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,960
And, uh, and we've got some cool stuff to give away as well.

120
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,760
Yeah.

121
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,040
Like, uh,

122
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,720
promo clothes, promo clothes.

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
My cam show.

124
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,200
Yeah, baby, we love it.

125
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,720
Oh, yeah.

126
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
And by the way, no video guys.

127
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,320
That's the only thing that we agreed upon because I didn't want you to see my ugly ass naked.

128
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
Oh.

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,800
By the way, Bobby, you look very healthy.

130
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Thank you, too.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
And by the way, let's go beyond.

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,800
So what is wrong with an innocent, efficient time reaching needs to tell.

133
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,800
So be my inches and feet on the path.

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
What does it come to?

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Plays us to go.

136
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I've got to leave it.

137
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm on a job.

138
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
He Ryan,

139
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Raji like a man in the face.

140
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
He Ryan,

141
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Raji like a man in the face.

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
But buddy, he's burning.

143
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
That's the shot.

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
He sized his tummy.

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
He breaks out lull.

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
That's easy, easy.

147
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Just have to make it, we're so much better

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
The night is cold, I have to go

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
And for the time being, you're like this, you're

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
You're sleeping, isn't it?

She's ready to win, on the hot to nightfall

Real life, get it's blurry, scratch my skin

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
you build yourself, Bobby?

175
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,920
Can we just call you a massively famous porn star, or do we say adult film star, or what

176
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
do you like to go by?

177
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,840
Whatever you're going to call me, baby is all I'm going to call you.

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,360
So, you know, it's so fascinating because you actually, you're so well-known in outside

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,240
of the Netherlands, where you're from.

180
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,600
Did you start your career in the states or where did you really get, how does one get into

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
this?

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm not saying that I would want to try it or anything, but, uh, want to do a casting with

183
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
me?

184
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,840
Yeah, because it involved a couch, we just sit here in the pool and just, uh, we do it

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
in the pool.

186
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,920
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,840
Now, when I actually started, I first did like for four years with men's magazines,

188
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,800
like it's playboy, hustler, penthouse, all the stuff, like the top shelf's one.

189
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Well, how did that even happen?

190
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,760
You just said, I just said that over pictures to penthouse.

191
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,040
And they said, yeah, baby, come on, bye.

192
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Uh-huh.

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Good, you know, who made the decisions back then?

194
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,720
No, it was a better year.

195
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,040
Oh, so this is Dutch, Dutch, okay, yeah, yeah.

196
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

197
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,640
And since then, since I was in the magazine, I actually got a model agency in the

199
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,120
Netherlands, a glamour agency that wants to have me, so I went there and they gave me a few

200
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
jobs for the rest, I did everything myself.

201
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,480
I just took the plane to the states.

202
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Right.

203
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
That was it.

204
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
They're up with an agent.

205
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,920
I never saw and never knew.

206
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,160
I only knew that he was wearing a baseball cap.

207
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Uh-huh.

208
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
And his name was John.

209
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Right.

210
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
So you got on a plane.

211
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,200
You go see this guy with a baseball cap named John and then what was your first

212
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,160
movie you ever did?

213
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,640
My first movie was for private and I think it was explosive women.

214
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Right.

215
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
I see that.

216
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,240
Get on the other side of the pool, you.

217
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Yeah, I've seen that.

218
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Explosive.

219
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah, what was the plot of that movie?

220
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,080
Do you remember the story line?

221
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Please come in my face.

222
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Cool.

223
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Yeah.

224
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
How is that?

225
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Not originally.

226
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Well, yeah.

227
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,280
You know, that's what guys want though.

228
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,560
What is not what guys want?

229
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,360
I mean, what does every guy want?

230
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
You would know.

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Hold on a second.

232
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,160
Guys, get your girlfriend, get your wife.

233
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,640
Have a listen right now because Bobby Eden knows exactly what guys really want.

234
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,200
When it comes to sex, what does every single guy want?

235
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,160
I think they want a fantasy.

236
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,160
That's it.

237
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Yeah.

238
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
That's interesting.

239
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Okay.

240
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,520
But there are like different guys.

241
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,360
I have so many different guys that email me like some of them just like to wing, unlike

242
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,040
the most hardcore movies that they can see, like, only the real big, well, big shit.

243
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm pretty hard-crushed up and I'm pretty, I'm actually a wimp.

244
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
But there are also...

245
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Yeah.

246
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
I've seen your movies.

247
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
You're no wimp.

248
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Excuse me.

249
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
She says it.

250
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,720
You're doing stuff that I can, yeah, no, you're not a wimp by any means.

251
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,040
Yeah, it's compared to other, it goes sometimes, and I'm pretty finilla.

252
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
I think.

253
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Okay.

254
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,760
But I do like it's rough sometimes.

255
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Yeah.

256
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
That's what I must hear.

257
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Do you enjoy it?

258
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
I haven't done a movie in a while, but you're doing some of your own independent movies,

259
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
now, is that what you're looking for?

260
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Yeah.

261
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,720
For our website, Bobby EdenLive.com.

262
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,480
Is that with just you, or with girls, or with the farm animals, or...

263
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,760
That is with me.

264
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,640
With me, with girls, and the stuntcock.

265
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Oh, really?

266
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
A stuntcock?

267
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
So everything is almost in POV style.

268
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Awesome.

269
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
So you can imagine.

270
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,880
So how does one apply for the stuntcock position?

271
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,800
Is this like a hand model, and you look through pictures, through headshots, and...

272
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
I just look at the cock.

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's it.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And what a great job.

275
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,560
I'm in the wrong business.

276
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,040
Speaking of fantasies, we got to Billy Idol lined up with flesh for fantasy, which is

277
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
one of your requests.

278
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,640
Now that we went to Billy Idol, thank you very much, by the way, for inviting us for a great

279
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
time.

280
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Have you been in a long time fan of a Billy?

281
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Yes.

282
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
I love him.

283
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
And he was so sexy, and you think?

284
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I probably, you probably won't love him.

285
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
No, he looked good.

286
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Yeah.

287
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
I was surprised.

288
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Nice body.

289
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Yeah.

290
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
It was like 54 or something.

291
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I know.

292
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
I was surprised.

293
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
It was okay.

294
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Yeah.

295
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Did you get a lot of shows, a lot of rock shows?

296
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,360
I think porn and rock and roll somehow always feels like it goes together.

297
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,200
Well, lately I go to shows, but with the scorpions, I don't read.

298
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
I didn't like that.

299
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
It sucked.

300
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Suffolk to relax.

301
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
There's still alive, right?

302
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Yeah.

303
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
It was in the key club.

304
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Okay.

305
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Yeah, perfect.

306
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,240
And it went to steel pants, or actually two days ago.

307
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Really?

308
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Yeah.

309
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
That was fun.

310
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Yeah.

311
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
I love that.

312
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
That's awesome.

313
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,640
Well, let's play some Billy Idol here for a second and we'll be back with more of adult

314
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,440
superstar Bobby Eden on the Daily Source Code streaming live at noagendastream.com.

315
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
Don't forget the chat, noagendachat.net.

We got a special surprise everyone hanging out in the chat, stay tuned.

318
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:58,040
I didn't like the music, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like

319
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like

320
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like

321
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:10,040
the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like

322
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:24,040
the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance,

323
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance,

324
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance,

325
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:47,320
I didn't do anything without the dance, I didn't like the dance, I didn't like the dance, down,

326
00:16:47,320 --> 00:17:02,320
It's out to midnight, why don't you feel it all right?

327
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Oh yeah, tonight's a light day, I used to want more days to know how I am.

328
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,320
In the name of the door, the last questions I read all.

329
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Oh yeah, bass two bass, I'm back to back.

330
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,320
You've seen and feel me, my shakes are shining.

331
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Rich, let's hope and to see.

332
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:53,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

333
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

334
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

335
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:29,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

336
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Rich, let's hope and to see.

337
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:47,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

338
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:57,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

339
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:10,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

340
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

341
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:25,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

342
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:34,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

343
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:52,320
We come high, let's hope and to see.

344
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,320
So we were just trying to reminisce about the concert.

345
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,320
I don't remember playing the song, but you do.

346
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Yeah, I guess I had more to drink than you did.

347
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,320
So we're reading along with the chat room at no agenda chat.net.

348
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
If you have any questions for Bobby, now it would be the time.

349
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
I even saw someone just voted by in the morning.

350
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Very nice.

351
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
We appreciate you guys thinking with us.

352
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Bobby, I know that you were in Vegas for a day or two.

353
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Yes.

354
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,320
You care to tell me what happened there?

355
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Or is this one of these what happens in Vegas days and Vegas type things?

356
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
No, I can tell you.

357
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Are you ready?

358
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Do I have to sit on the side of the pool or something?

359
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
No, you can stay.

360
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
All right, all right.

361
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I will be a live part.

362
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Okay, what happened in Vegas?

363
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
I got married.

364
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
What?

365
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
No.

366
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Yes, Elvis gave me a way.

367
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,320
This guy back over here with the guy who came with you to the night.

368
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
You got married in the box?

369
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Yeah.

370
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
He's going to be with us.

371
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Nice.

372
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
And it's a real, you're really, you're off the market now.

373
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
You're done.

374
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Yeah.

375
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
But I'm still, but I'm still, you know, available for some, you know.

376
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Let's keep the fans to see a live good.

377
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Yeah, I like that.

378
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
I'm just like, wow, you know, but you're not going to stop.

379
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,320
You're going to keep doing your shows and definitely.

380
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
God, I love you so much.

381
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
You're so awesome.

382
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
I cannot stop.

383
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Those breasts by the way, Bobby.

384
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
I know you're so proud of you had them done.

385
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
They are awesome, man.

386
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
I'd like the way they were before.

387
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Because they're better now.

388
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Yeah.

389
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Was that a tough decision?

390
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Yeah.

391
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Yeah.

392
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Actually, yes.

393
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Yeah.

394
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Yeah.

395
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Because I was chicken.

396
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,320
I have seen so many bad book jobs, and I'm pretty happy with it.

397
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Yeah.

398
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
So.

399
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Were you ever done here in this day?

400
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
To those Americans?

401
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
No.

402
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Those are Dutch books.

403
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Yeah.

404
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
But actually, by an American guy.

405
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Okay.

406
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Of course.

407
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
I see.

408
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Americans know how to make books.

409
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
You do not want to have your books made in any other country, but America.

410
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
We understand books really, really well.

411
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Yeah.

412
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
And what do your fans think of they commented on it?

413
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
They all are happy.

414
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
They love it.

415
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
They're like, did they grow up?

416
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Yeah.

417
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
And I'm like, what?

418
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
You noticed?

419
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Oh, man.

420
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Oh, those.

421
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
Just a little.

422
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Well, one thing I know is I can't drown now.

423
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
No.

424
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I just grab onto you and I'll be fine.

425
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
I'll be fine.

426
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I'll be with rare bags.

427
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Yeah.

428
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Yeah.

429
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
That's right, baby.

430
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
We're here with these old bags.

431
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
In the hilltop.

432
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Watch tower track.

433
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Come on.

434
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Come on.

435
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Come on.

436
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn.

437
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
So get those stakes up higher.

438
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,320
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there.

439
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
They're all living and they will make care.

440
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
And I'm just a devil with no despair.

441
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Some people are always beggars.

442
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,320
People are always beggars.

443
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Oh, I wish that there were more.

444
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
And the 24 hours in the day.

445
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Now, even if they were for it more,

446
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,320
I wouldn't sleep a minute of a way.

447
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Oh, those black jack and poker and the roulette.

448
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
We're a lot.

449
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
A fortune one and a lot.

450
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
It's on and every hit deal.

451
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
All you need is for hard and a new steal.

452
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
People are always beggars.

453
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,320
People are always beggars.

454
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
People are always beggars.

455
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
People are always beggars.

456
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Where do you need the unflagging and your warm and discretion?

457
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,320
All those holes down the drain.

458
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
People are always beggars.

459
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Turn and day in the night.

460
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Turn and night in the daytime.

461
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
If you see it, it'll watch.

462
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
You'll never be the same again.

463
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm gonna keep on the run.

464
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm gonna have me some fun.

465
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
It costs me a month, very less dime.

466
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Here, by wind, I'll broke a bill.

467
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Always remember that I had a swing in time.

468
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm gonna give it everything I've got.

469
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
They look for these, let the dice stay hot.

470
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
But then we shouldn't sell them with their fresh shots.

471
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,320
People are beggars.

472
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
People are beggars.

473
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
People are beggars.

474
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,320
People are beggars.

475
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Tell you, okay.

476
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Viva Las Vegas.

477
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Bobby even compiled her own playlist.

478
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
So these are all her favorite songs.

479
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
You got some real good ones in here.

480
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,320
In fact, you could program a daily source code any time.

481
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,320
You've got all of our songs here, man.

482
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
That's amazing.

483
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
It will be a partnering crime.

484
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
You can be my partner in a lot of things.

485
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,320
I've just decided, Mickey, it's too bad that you're leaving me.

486
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
No, Mickey.

487
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,320
It's too bad you're leaving me because I have a new girlfriend.

488
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
This is my new partner in crime.

489
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
No, I like Mickey.

490
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
Yeah.

491
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,320
I get out of the pool now.

492
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
You know what?

493
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I can have you both, okay?

494
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
I can handlaid.

495
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Now she's talking.

496
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Yeah.

497
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,320
That is one of your specialties is women.

498
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I love women.

499
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Yeah, me too.

500
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Pretty picky, but when I like them,

501
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
I go, just go.

502
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Have you ever like had to do a performance with someone

503
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,320
that you just thought, no, you're rich?

504
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Yes.

505
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
And did you go through with it?

506
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
Or did you just walk away?

507
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,320
I went down and I went up again.

508
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Oh, no, was it that disgusting?

509
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Yes.

510
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Oh, no.

511
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Tell me what happened.

512
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Yeah, it was actually, it was one of her first go-go.

513
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
And there was actually supposed to come another go.

514
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
So these girls show up.

515
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
I'm like, well, where should I go?

516
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Just like she couldn't come.

517
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
So you have this girl.

518
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
She looks kind of hot, and I'm like, okay, cool.

519
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
All right.

520
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
I wonder what's going down.

521
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
I'm like, oh, what's it like?

522
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
We're going up.

523
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Just not fresh.

524
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
No.

525
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Oh.

526
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Poor girl.

527
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
This is disgusting.

528
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
So went up.

529
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I look at the camera when I'm like, I don't know.

530
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
I said you're going to make this up to me.

531
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
So.

532
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Wow.

533
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
But I make her work mine.

534
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
So that's good.

535
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,320
But do you really get into it when you're, when you're, yeah?

536
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Yeah.

537
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
They all sit all right.

538
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I'm convinced all of, well, adult actors just say that.

539
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Oh, yeah.

540
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Really enjoying it.

541
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm really into it.

542
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I'm really coming.

543
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Well, let's say, like, you have good days and bad days.

544
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
But most of the time, like, 95%.

545
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
I choose my own actors and actresses.

546
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
And most of them are friends.

547
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
So I make sure I'm going to have a great time.

548
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Right.

549
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,320
And if I don't like it, then well, then probably you will see it in my phase or whatever.

550
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,320
But like, I think 95% that I've done with the scenes, I enjoyed it.

551
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,320
And do you have a real script and a whole idea of what you're going to do?

552
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Or just, is it kind of free form or how does that work?

553
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,320
It depends for which company, because they actually decide which you're going to do.

554
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Like some, some like companies tell you, do whatever you want to do.

555
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,320
And some companies like, for example, private will, you know, direct you into it.

556
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
Yeah.

557
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Isn't that water home?

558
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Yeah.

559
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
I really do love it.

560
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm, I think I'm going to have to stay in the pool for a little while.

561
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I can't get out right now.

562
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
If you know what I mean.

563
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Let's point another song then.

564
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
How about that?

565
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
This is David Lee Roth.

566
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
You big fan of Anne Hayman.

567
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
David Lee.

568
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
I mean, whatever.

569
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Why California girls?

570
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Because I love it.

571
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
We're in California.

572
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Makes so much sense to me.

573
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
We'll be taking some questions from the chat room.

574
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,320
We've got the laptops here at the pool, Miller, gender chat.net.

575
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Just put them up there.

576
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Bobby is reading along on the laptop as well.

577
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,320
In the meantime, Diamond Dave, California girls on the Charlie.

578
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Well, he's close through time.

579
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,320
I've been waiting till no stars can wear.

580
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Me and the sun.

581
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
They're hooked with the waving top.

582
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
They're not the outfit.

583
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
I'm down there.

584
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,320
I've been waiting till stars can wear.

585
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,320
They really, really feel all right.

586
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
The dawn of girls sweep the waiting.

587
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,320
He's saying if there's objects on their thigh.

588
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,320
I take it home to pick energy on your neck.

589
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Playing on the road.

590
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Yeah, when we play on theOne Air Society

591
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Sapphire Systems.

592
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,320
The way it's closed, it's the sunshine

593
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,320
In the room, it's all been so dead

594
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I've been a free journey

595
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm wild, I'm close by a hungry person

596
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,320
I've been all round, it's great being world

597
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,320
And I've seen all kinds of girls

598
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,320
In the game, but I couldn't wait to get back

599
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,320
In this stage, back to the theaters

600
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Girls in the world, I've taken a kiss

601
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
This song, while you're young

602
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Who wish they'd love to think of

603
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:17,320
I wish they all could be gathered on your feet

604
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Girls in the world, I've taken a kiss

605
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
This song, while you're young

606
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Who wish they all could be gathered on your feet

607
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Girls in the world, I've taken a kiss

608
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,320
This song, while you're young

609
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
I've taken a kiss

610
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
This song, while you're young

611
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I've taken a kiss

612
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Diamond David Lee Roth, which they all could be

613
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,320
California girls, and right now I'm surrounded by a couple of them

614
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,320
I've got the lovely and his Mickey here, splashing around in the pool

615
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,320
And Bobby, even here, I'm glad you didn't decide to wear a bathing top

616
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,320
No, do you even own one?

617
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
I do own one, because where I'm staying

618
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm sorry, we're in America, that's the right

619
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,320
It's like crazy that we make the best porn in the world

620
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,320
In America, yet there's so prudish about everything

621
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,320
You would have to agree, American porn is the best, right?

622
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Why can't I say no now?

623
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
No, seriously, that was okay

624
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,320
I mean, you won't insult all of America, if you say it's not

625
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,320
But I think American porn, maybe because of the language

626
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
You know, it's like, yeah, baby coming up face, you know?

627
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Yeah, that's better, it sounds good

628
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
You just say it in Dutch, it's like snipping a work

629
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
No, no, it sounds like you're going to throw on

630
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,320
But French is cute too

631
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
You've done French movies?

632
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
I've done one

633
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Did you have to study lines for that all?

634
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,320
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

635
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

636
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,320
And German is, well, I think German is pretty hard, it's like harsh, but I like it

637
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Yeah, but German films are always like, come in and then got a fit to it

638
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
It's like a snush, yeah, I think it's nice

639
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
For nush me, I don't even want to know what that means

640
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,320
You better not be for nush in me any time

641
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Just take that girl

642
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Let's take scare in you

643
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,320
No, no, you need to have a lot more going

644
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Disgare me, I think

645
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Couple questions from the chat room, Memphis Jeff says

646
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Bobby, you've obviously have to keep the sex appeal turn on

647
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Full as a self promotion vehicle

648
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,320
He says salesman getting burned out from being on too long

649
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Hell, even Adam got tired of sucking advertising cock

650
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
What do you do to get yourself turned on?

651
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,320
I do not so many movies, it's like a lot of bills too

652
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,320
So I keep it exclusive and fun

653
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,320
If you don't do them every day, then it's a new experience every time

654
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Who the hell does it every day?

655
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
There are girls doing it every day

656
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Every single day

657
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Every single day

658
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
Really?

659
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Can you bring that to you?

660
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
How can we didn't bring them by?

661
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
I think of you some numbers

662
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,320
But seriously, every day that's outrageous

663
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
How can you even do it every day?

664
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
No

665
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Can you imagine if they have a private life

666
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
And they would then again

667
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Yeah

668
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
Do people recognize you on the street?

669
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Do you dress down or dress differently?

670
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
So you're a little less recognizable

671
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Well, I think I'm kind of down to earth

672
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,320
So I don't wear a really full on makeup

673
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
What's going on?

674
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
To destroy the supermarket

675
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
Or if they do recognize me

676
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Then people are not gonna say

677
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Like, I saw you in this movie

678
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
I went on you

679
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
They're not gonna say anything

680
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
I would

681
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
I guess what I would just do

682
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
They're about me, you know what I was doing

683
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Exactly

684
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,320
You must have a lot of regulars of the webcam shows

685
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Who would drop by

686
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Do you know them by their face?

687
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Yeah, because they actually turn on their webcam

688
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Really?

689
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Yeah, by face and by their cock

690
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Do you think that's a turn on for a lot of guys

691
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
To show their face to you?

692
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
I think so

693
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Interesting

694
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Yeah

695
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Interesting

696
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I like it when I get, you know, being watched

697
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
So

698
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Wow

699
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Do you like it?

700
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
You're getting, you know, being watched

701
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I don't know what I'm touching myself

702
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Yeah

703
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
Yeah, I think so

704
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Yeah, I don't know

705
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Shall we try that later?

706
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
Watch me

707
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
Mickey, will you set up the gallery?

708
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,320
She's always watched

709
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Funk wants to know

710
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Bobby, if everyone has a fantasy

711
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
What is yours?

712
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
My fantasy

713
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
He's getting a big orgy

714
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
What goes

715
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
And guys

716
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
I'm in the middle

717
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
And they wash it me

718
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
With fresh fruit

719
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
I'll over my body

720
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
And leak it off

721
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Really?

722
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
That's truly your fantasy

723
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Yeah

724
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
And have you ever fulfilled that fantasy?

725
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
I mean, it seems like we could get a, I mean, Mickey, get the camera

726
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
What's that?

727
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
It seems like we could arrange that

728
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
And you've ever done everything like that?

729
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Sometimes

730
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
If you can keep it a fantasy

731
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Then it's better

732
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
It's nicer

733
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Nice better

734
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,320
You say most guys who, who call in your webcam shows

735
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Are they, are they married or in a relationship?

736
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
Yeah, a lot of them are

737
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Yeah

738
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,320
And, you know, actually some of the girls like wives

739
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
They come on chat too

740
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
When they do it together

741
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Really?

742
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Oh, that's kind of hot

743
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Yeah

744
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
So I like a few couples there too

745
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
And I like a few guys that just want to talk

746
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Or, yeah, play games

747
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
I love a guy that play games

748
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
What kind of games?

749
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
It's like blind games

750
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
No, mind games

751
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
Minds, psychology

752
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Games

753
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
They do, yeah

754
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
With my sports

755
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Puzzles

756
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
No

757
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Crossword

758
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
And you help them with the crossword puzzle

759
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Yeah

760
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
We even watch, you know, soccer together

761
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
If there's like a big game on

762
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
Speaking of which

763
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I know

764
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
Man, team, team Bobby

765
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Team DJ

766
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
You know, we were all like really excited

767
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
I even got John C. DeVore

768
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
To sign up to your Twitter feed

769
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
He was following you

770
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
And then they lost

771
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
I mean, you must have a lot of

772
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
Disappointed fans out there

773
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah

774
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
But there is a

775
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Yeah, a consolation

776
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
What do you call it?

777
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Consolation

778
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Price

779
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
A really?

780
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Yeah, and they can win

781
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Also some stuff

782
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
If the trader may be the best picture

783
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
With me actually in it

784
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
So they need to perform in the picture

785
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Wait, let me get this right

786
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
So they have to take a picture of themselves

787
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Yes

788
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
And you have to be in the picture

789
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Yes, I have to be in a picture too

790
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm very clear

791
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Or just a picture

792
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
A big cardboard cutout

793
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Yeah, they can see whatever they want to do

794
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Be creative

795
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
And they can win like a package

796
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
DVDs, poster, shining cards

797
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Do you have a lot of merchandise

798
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Do you have like, do you have the Bobby

799
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Even real doll?

800
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Do you have one of those?

801
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
No, not yet

802
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Have you ever considered it?

803
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Because they're expensive

804
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
But they're good, man

805
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
They look good

806
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
But they're good

807
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Have you like felt one inside?

808
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
No, have you?

809
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Yes

810
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
And how does it feel?

811
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
How does it compare to the real deal?

812
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
Real real

813
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Really?

814
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
It's scary, yeah

815
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Let me just have to ask Santa

816
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
See if I can get one of those

817
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
You can have one behind the window

818
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,320
When Mickey is going, just put her on

819
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Just sitting there next to the clouds

820
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
I don't think I could have sex with the doll

821
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
I just don't have sex

822
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,320
But it's good just to have to have one

823
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Yeah, it's good just to have one

824
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
And maybe then too

825
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Because when you're leaving the house

826
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
And she's not alone, no?

827
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Please don't

828
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Right, baby, don't worry

829
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
I'll be gone for just a couple days

830
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm in San Francisco

831
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
It's a freak out of neighbor

832
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
But here's Bobby, the real doll

833
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
You can lose her

834
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Mr. oil wants to know

835
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,320
Oh, second

836
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,320
As you're aware that Adam is a former Soviet spy

837
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,320
If you were to be in a spy porn film

838
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
What would your spy name be?

839
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
My spy name

840
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Yeah, like

841
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
What did you say?

842
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Bobby Curry

843
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
Bobby Curry

844
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
That's not Russian enough

845
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
It's got to be Soviet

846
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Bobby and Bruce Gaff

847
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I don't think we can answer this question

848
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Yeah

849
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
But you asked me to

850
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Decuab Nika for you

851
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
I love Nika

852
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
It's kind of an interesting choice

853
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Yeah

854
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,320
And you particularly

855
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
And I like the songs

856
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I do actually show them

857
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
But I'm touring

858
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Oh really?

859
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Of course you do touring shows as well

860
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Yes

861
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
No shows you all you were in Los Angeles

862
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Why not?

863
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Okay, you were just on vacation

864
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Have you done shows in America though?

865
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
No, not really

866
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Well, I did the AVN

867
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Adult video

868
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Yeah

869
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
What is it?

870
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Network

871
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Adult AVN

872
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,320
What is it?

873
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Well, the adult

874
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Is it a video award?

875
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Yeah

876
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
That's in Vegas, you should write

877
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Yeah, that's in Vegas

878
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
That's in January

879
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
That's where I've been a few times

880
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Do you nominated for anything?

881
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
No

882
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
Not this year

883
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
I haven't done

884
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
You know, won't be for a while

885
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
So, okay

886
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
But you're going to do one soon

887
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
And you're going to tell us about that next

888
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
I hope

889
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Of course

890
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay, good

891
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
What do you want?

892
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Anyway, you're gone too

893
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
Love, love, love, love, love, love

894
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Love, love

895
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Hey

896
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Hey

897
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Thought so long

898
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
I didn't taste it together

899
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
But now

900
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,320
But now it's going away

901
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Hey

902
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Hey

903
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Hey

904
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Hey

929
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320

But stop it, but stop it, but stop it

933
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,320
Am chanting and learning about the song of the skull

934
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:39,200
Love, love

935
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Don't worry, we don't explain

936
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,160
God to God, love, love, love

937
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Lainer sits on my Zephyr

938
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Give your dollar and shine

939
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
And kiss love, look up

940
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Look up, look up, look up

941
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Walk away

942
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Hey, hey, hey

943
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Jesus, look up, look up, look up

944
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,160
You see, it's like there's something

945
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,160
I'm not just a team, I was just a good judge

946
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I'm not just a judge, I'm just a genius

947
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man

948
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I'm not a man, I'm not a man

949
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,160
I'm just a good detective today today

950
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,160
You're not a detective today

951
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
It suits me, it suits me there

952
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,160
You don't believe me, anyway

953
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Even though I don't believe you

954
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,160
I wish immortals beumental

955
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Instead of Space I'll Only Last

956
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Out For The Road

957
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Somewhere in the world

958
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Once I've left...

959
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
I'll be called monster

960
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,520
Everybody's gonna love today,

961
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,360
and everybody's gonna love you

962
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,200

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
Everybody's gonna love me

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Everybody's gonna love me

973
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,680
Everybody's gonna love me

974
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,280
Everybody's gonna love today

975
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,440
Everybody's gonna love

976
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,120
Everybody's gonna love fattier

00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,640
Everybody's gonna love tonight

978
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,920
Everybody's gonna love you

979
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Everybody's gonna love you

980
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,440
Everybody's gonna love me

981
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,520
Everybody's gonna love me

982
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,120
Everybody's gonna love me

983
00:41:38,120 --> 00:42:01,120
I love today on DSC 842 coming to you from the pool. We've had the transmitters kind of breaking up a little bit.

984
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,120
But I don't care how I'm in the pool with Bobby Eden.

985
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
It's worth it.

986
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Yeah, it's worth it. Absolutely.

987
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,120
So while the song was playing a couple of people came up with some really good,

988
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,120
so be it's by adult names for you.

989
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Yeah, we've got Natasha Sakamoff, which I think is good.

990
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
Yeah.

991
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
And Molotov cocktails.

992
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,120
That could be a home movie, by the way.

993
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Do you imagine that?

994
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
That's Natasha Wang.

995
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
What was her?

996
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Natasha. Natasha Sakamoff.

997
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
That could be.

998
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
We could do a home movie.

999
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Yeah.

1000
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
Seriously, could I produce it?

1001
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Sure.

1002
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
Want to stare in it?

1003
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Uh, it's done cock maybe.

1004
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Maybe.

1005
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
I don't know.

1006
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Then we'll do it then.

1007
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
And I actually would do it with Mickey.

1008
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
And then you could feel like good.

1009
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Yeah, this is something like a very good idea.

1010
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,120
A lot of a sudden I'm really liking this.

1011
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,120
Mickey, say yes.

1012
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,120
We're going to get in so much trouble for this show.

1013
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
I'd be gentle Mickey.

1014
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Oh, yeah.

1015
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
So, uh, she likes it right.

1016
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Yeah, no, she does.

1017
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
She does kind of.

1018
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
And I'm the vanilla one and she's.

1019
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Yeah, no, it's, you know, it's, uh, what's that?

1020
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,120
I think you should remove yourself from the pool area.

1021
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,120
You're, uh, you're getting way too into the show.

1022
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Uh, a question from Shaki, I think.

1023
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,120
Bobby, did you ever fulfill a random fantasy from a fan?

1024
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,120
And if yes, what was it?

1025
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,120
If no, would you ever do such a thing?

1026
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
No.

1027
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
No.

1028
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
No.

1029
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Never ever.

1030
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
No.

1031
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,120
I bet the fans, you know, if they come out to see what shows and stuff,

1032
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,120
a bit, they're like, are all hoping you will.

1033
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,120
Yeah, and they ask me if I do fan fucks and everything.

1034
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
But I'm sorry.

1035
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Is that a category fan fuck?

1036
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
Yeah.

1037
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
What?

1038
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Yeah.

1039
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Yeah, a lot of girls do it.

1040
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,120
Really?

1041
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Yeah.

1042
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
For free?

1043
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Well, I don't think it's for free.

1044
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,120
So, fascinating.

1045
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,120
Yeah.

1046
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
This is a very interesting business.

1047
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,120
But I think if you want to fulfill a fantasy, then it should be a fantasy.

1048
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,120
If it should be a fantasy, I agree.

1049
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,120
You think that that's a lot more important in your line of work is really the fantasy aspect,

1050
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,120
versus the actual physical stuff.

1051
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
That's what I think.

1052
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
Yeah.

1053
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
Definitely.

1054
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Yeah.

1055
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Okay.

1056
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
I think.

1057
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,120
So every, now you want every night of, uh, is it, uh, are you on your own side?

1058
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Or we're, we're, we're, we're, we find you.

1059
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,120
I'm a webcam babes, uh, dot com.

1060
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
You know, huh?

1061
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,120
And you can find me four or five times a week, most of the time two times a day.

1062
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Really?

1063
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
Yeah.

1064
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
And, and for how long are you on like an hour or a hour?

1065
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Most of the time for two hours every time.

1066
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
Right.

1067
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Uh, it depends.

1068
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Like, if I have a lot of fun and, you know, there are a lot of people in.

1069
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,120
And I will stay longer.

1070
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,120
Right.

1071
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,120
It seems like if there's a lot of guys and girls and couples in the world,

1072
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,120
where else calling that, you know, it maybe doesn't feel quite that personal.

1073
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,120
How do you, how do you, how do you manage that?

1074
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
Do you have like a million windows open on your screen?

1075
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,120
And you can see everybody or how does that kind of work?

1076
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:04,120
Well, we call it like, there are like, people that come in and go out like right away.

1077
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
But like, after a while, you get to know the people.

1078
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,120
If they've been like, my memory is pretty good.

1079
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,120
So, um, yeah, if they actually tell me the story,

1080
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,120
the most of the time the next day, I will be a member of the name.

1081
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,120
It's like, I think I'm training my memory.

1082
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,120
So, you know, if there is a special guy, yeah, it's good.

1083
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
Yeah, it's good.

1084
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,120
If there is a special, a special story or a special guy,

1085
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,120
a little bit more like, the assholes are probably won't remember or.

1086
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Right.

1087
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,120
I'm sure you, yeah, I'm sure you must get a fair amount of those, too.

1088
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,120
Yeah, maybe once in a while, that's so often.

1089
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Tell me about your, I think, and girls on it.

1090
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Like, well, yeah, I'd hope so.

1091
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Yeah.

1092
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,120
It's one of your specialties.

1093
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,120
What are the girls want when they, what do they want to see?

1094
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
They're the talk.

1095
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Really, really.

1096
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
It's like dirty talk.

1097
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120
Yeah.

1098
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,120
Cool.

1099
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,120
And do you type that, are you actually, is it live voice connection as well?

1100
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,120
I can do sound, but most of the time they hear my music or they hear me sing,

1101
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,120
because once you get into somebody personal, then everyone can hear it.

1102
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,120
So they all want to ask you, like, scream my name and my name.

1103
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,120
So I'm not really into that.

1104
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,120
Right.

1105
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,120
You're like, most of the time too many people in.

1106
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,120
If there's one or two, then it's fine.

1107
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,120
All right.

1108
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,120
I type it.

1109
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,120
Do you also do private sessions with people?

1110
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Uh, no.

1111
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,120
We are like one on like one, so they can, like, check with me one on one,

1112
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,120
but there are also other people that can few exactly what I do.

1113
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
Okay, but if I'm chatting with you, then no one else can see one.

1114
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
No one else can see one.

1115
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Yeah.

1116
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
You can, like, click on private and then reprived.

1117
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,120
So no one else can see it.

1118
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,120
And if you stay in the main chat, then, of course, everybody can read it.

1119
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,120
But most of the time, I click on the name right away, because I think it's something

1120
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,120
personal.

1121
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,120
Right.

1122
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,120
Interesting, though.

1123
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,120
The girls want dirty talk.

1124
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
I know.

1125
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
That's, there's some, I got some girls.

1126
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,120
I'm like, oh, yeah, we do this.

1127
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Sweet thing is she was like, no man, open your pussy.

1128
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
Let me eat your out.

1129
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
And I'm like, oh.

1130
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,120
And then what's the dirty part?

1131
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Everything, no.

1132
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,120
Everything is like, you would be amazed.

1133
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,120
Is it like that?

1134
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,120
Go ahead.

1135
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,120
I'm listening.

1136
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,120
Well, I get this for myself.

1137
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,120
Oh, shoot.

1138
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
Guys, I try.

1139
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,120
Yeah.

1140
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,120
I think we actually, we might have already out of control right now.

1141
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,120
Yeah, I'm trying.

1142
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,120
We might have a couple of minutes in the chat room.

1143
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,120
I don't know.

1144
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,120
I think silver might be one of, we don't have a lot of female listeners, unfortunately.

1145
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,120
I'm not quite sure why that is.

1146
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
Maybe too much of a boy's club.

1147
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
We're going to change that.

1148
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,120
So tell me about your own psych.

1149
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,120
Because this is kind of recently, you relaunched or you really put it all together.

1150
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Yeah.

1151
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
I've relaunched my new site.

1152
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,120
It's BobbyEdenLife.com.

1153
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,120
And I have every week.

1154
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,120
I have a free cam show there.

1155
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,120
Okay.

1156
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,120
For my members.

1157
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
There was a forum.

1158
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,120
You can see new pictures, new videos.

1159
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,120
It's all exclusively shot for the site.

1160
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
So where you can, yeah.

1162
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,120
You can't find it anywhere else.

1163
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,120
And I'm very interactive.

1164
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Uh-huh.

1165
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,120
She's very interactive.

1166
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Yeah.

1167
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,120
Very interactive.

1168
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,120
What is it cost to a membership?

1169
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,120
I think it's $29.

1170
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Yeah.

1171
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,120
And you get a free cam show for that as well?

1172
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
Yeah, every week.

1173
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,120
Really?

1174
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,120
How long does that cam show?

1175
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,120
4 an hour.

1176
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
Really?

1177
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Yeah.

1178
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
Well, that's a good deal.

1179
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,120
That's very good.

1180
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,120
Yeah.

1181
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,120
I love that.

1182
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
I got to see it.

1183
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,120
Mm-hmm.

1184
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,120
What does it build?

1185
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,120
Something else like librarybooks.com.

1186
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,120
What?

1187
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
What?

1188
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
When I charge to my credit card.

1189
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,120
How is it show up on my statement?

1190
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,120
To be honest.

1191
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,120
I don't know.

1192
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
Who cares?

1193
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,120
Pet love for pets.com or something.

1194
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
Yeah.

1195
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,120
But also, when you're joining, you get like seven or eight out of pills.

1196
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
From the DNA.

1197
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Because I'm part of the detonation army.

1198
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
The what?

1199
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
The detonation army.

1200
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,120
Same as the kiss army, but then detonation army.

1201
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Okay.

1202
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,120
And who are the other girls?

1203
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
Ficky fats.

1204
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
All just.

1205
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,120
They're American.

1206
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,120
I'm actually the only European one.

1207
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Huh?

1208
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,120
Well, Ficky is actually from Norway.

1209
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Uh-huh.

1210
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
She's hot.

1211
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Is she really tall?

1212
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Is that when I'm thinking of her?

1213
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,120
Oh, I know.

1214
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,120
She's very hot.

1215
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,120
Yeah.

1216
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
No.

1217
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
That's good.

1218
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,120
Yeah.

1219
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Yeah.

1220
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,120
Yeah.

1221
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,120
You're driving me crazy.

1222
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,120
I'm meeting with her next week.

1223
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
I'm going to do a cam show.

1224
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Yeah.

1225
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,120
So they better sign up so they can see it.

1226
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Yeah.

1227
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
And that'll be on your side.

1228
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,120
The cam show.

1229
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,120
Yes.

1230
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,120
I'm so becoming a Mickey.

1231
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,120
Can I spend 29 bucks a month?

1232
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,120
I'm not a member yet.

1233
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
Yeah.

1234
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,120
And do you take like direction for your pictures?

1235
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,120
Do you do certain things in your videos?

1236
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,120
That people want that that your members want to see?

1237
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,120
They can do re-crest on the like forum what they want to see.

1238
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,120
And maybe if I'm a good move, we can do it.

1239
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,120
It's a fascinating business.

1240
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:48,120
I've always been intrigued by the adult industry mainly because you're always like three steps ahead of really transactions online.

1241
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,120
I mean, just, I remember back in the day,

1242
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,120
Casa Rosa was doing live shows.

1243
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,120
And even it may only been like one frame per second or something.

1244
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,120
Yeah.

1245
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,120
They're already in charging money for it.

1246
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
I know.

1247
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:07,120
I mean, I would argue if we say that the adult business really makes the most money online to probably any business.

1248
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,120
Maybe it's equal to air travel.

1249
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,120
But I don't know.

1250
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,120
Do you have any, any view on that?

1251
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,120
I think it's, well, it's certainly a business that is always there.

1252
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,120
Yeah.

1253
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,120
And I think it's a billion, yeah, billion dollar business.

1254
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,120
Yeah.

1255
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,120
I'll take one percent of that.

1256
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Mm-hmm.

1257
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,120
That's nice.

1258
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,120
Just a start your own side.

1259
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,120
Yeah.

1260
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Yeah, that's what I need.

1261
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
Yeah.

1262
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
I need to get into porn.

1263
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,120
Together with Mickey.

1264
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
Yeah.

1265
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,120
I'm like, I joined in.

1266
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,120
Well, that's plan B.

1267
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
If nothing else plans, tens out.

1268
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,120
If the listeners don't support,

1269
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,120
then we'll have to move to plan B.

1270
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
We can always do that.

1271
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,120
But how long do you plan on doing this?

1272
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Well, as long as I just like to do it.

1273
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,120
Mm-hmm.

1274
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,120
I'm no 30.

1275
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,120
Oh, that's where it is when I said that.

1276
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,120
I, girl, you don't look a day over 22.

1277
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
That's good.

1278
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,120
Yeah.

1279
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
I'm trying.

1280
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
No, as long as I like to, like, perform.

1281
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,120
But that's why I only do it now for my side.

1282
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,120
Because, um, I think, you know, I...

1283
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,120
Well, you're building your own empire.

1284
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,120
Yeah.

1285
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah.

1286
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,120
You're on, uh, brand Bobby.

1287
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
Yeah.

1288
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
And as long as my body, you know, still looks okay to do it.

1289
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,120
Like, if I'm, let's say, well,

1290
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
50.

1291
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,120
And I look like a sack of potatoes.

1292
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Mm-hmm.

1293
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,120
There's a market for that.

1294
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,120
Yeah.

1295
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,120
But I'm not really interested.

1296
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,120
Oh, you're getting ready.

1297
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Like, oh, my God.

1298
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,120
I'm getting ready.

1299
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
Oh, my God.

1300
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,120
All right.

1301
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,120
Now, let's take a vote, everybody.

1302
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,120
Do you think Bobby's still good for these?

1303
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Yeah.

1304
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
I think we're still good for these.

1305
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
I don't know why.

1306
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
Absolutely.

1307
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,120
I'm glad you chose this next song, Bobby,

1308
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,120
because I've not heard it in a long time.

1309
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
Cinderella.

1310
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
Yeah.

1311
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,120
I mean, God.

1312
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,120
I've seen it recently.

1313
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,120
Oh, boy.

1314
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,120
Really?

1315
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,120
Oh, boy.

1316
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,120
Where?

1317
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,120
Here in, in, just, yeah.

1318
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,120
It was for the scorpions.

1319
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
They opened up for the scorpions.

1320
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,120
Wow.

1321
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,120
That's crazy.

1322
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,120
How was Tommy Keeper's voice?

1323
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,120
Was it still up there?

1324
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,120
I think it was really good.

1325
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,120
Yeah.

1326
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,120
I really like what they were doing back in the day.

1327
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,120
And they kind of like disappeared.

1328
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,120
I'm not going to show what happened.

1329
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
It just got kind of weird or something.

1330
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,120
Oh, the disappeared now.

1331
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,120
I saw them live.

1332
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,120
And it still works.

1333
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,120
He still got it.

1334
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,120
This is, uh, don't know what you got till it's gone.

1335
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,120
I can't tell you baby.

1336
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,120
What we've run.

1337
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,120
I can't make you feel.

1338
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,120
Won't you feel so lonely?

1339
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,120
I let it show.

1340
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,120
I can't give you back.

1341
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,120
What's been heard?

1342
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,120
How did it come and go?

1343
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,120
To all that's left.

1344
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,120
All the world.

1345
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:03,120
I can't give you.

1346
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:11,120
If we take some time thinking of baby.

1347
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,120
Take some time thinking of you.

1348
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:22,120
If you pray that one of you.

1349
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:29,120
Don't know what you got till it's gone.

1350
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,120

I can't tell you.

1352
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:46,120
Now that you're what I've got till it's gone.

1353
00:53:46,120 --> 00:54:06,120
I can't feel the things that the cops have paid.

1354
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,120
I can't give you back.

1355
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,120
You have so far away.

1381
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,120
That's huge.

1382
00:57:46,120 --> 00:58:01,120
Thank you.

1383
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:11,120
Thank you.

1384
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:16,120
I love that.

1385
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:31,120
How many codes are you giving me?

1386
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:41,120
What are they thinking about your vocation?

1387
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:48,120
I'm the Benjamin of the family.

1388
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:58,120

1389
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:13,120

What are they thinking about?

1392
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:52,120
I think I'm a huge fan of the adult industry and I promote it wherever I can as long as it's safe and as long as it's all done within some adult context and not crazy.

1393
00:59:52,120 --> 01:00:08,120
I think it's a great way to do it and I think that what you guys together doing with all the promotion and using the internet is fascinating to watch and I hope you can really continue doing this for a long time.

1394
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:23,120
I think that's what everything you do with all the work you do.

1395
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:33,120
You're a scrapbooker?

1396
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:48,120
Really?

1397
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:57,120
Good idea.
