00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Shara Charley, 8-2-9-er, the Snapfoo Saturday.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're 16-1-7, and've been showing 5-9's up-time turn.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're not being lost.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're getting me out live.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I know it's in the street right now.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm destined to get a new curry.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the morning to get a new Sunday.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're back, baby.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Family, I'm a world black, baby.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Family, I'm back, baby.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Had a child.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Family, I'm sitting with another mind.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going blind.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Family, I'm a city of black, baby.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Family, I'm a world black, baby.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Family, I'm a world black, baby.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Family, I'm a world black, baby.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Family, I'm the damn things going by.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Family, I'm the damn thing going by.

98
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Black Betty kickin' off with Ram Dam's classic there.

99
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Oh boy, it looks like the chatroom's hose, but that's okay.

100
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
We'll get through it eventually.

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Maybe someone can check in and fix it.

102
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Meanwhile, there's some great tunes and talk coming up

103
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
on this edition of the Charlie.

104
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
With the Vapers.

105
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I see this narrative, there's nothing I should do.

106
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Oh, it's in colour.

107
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
You're here, it's brown.

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
You're right, I hate it.

109
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
It's a disguise.

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I have focused you when there's no one else around.

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
I got your picture.

112
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I got your picture.

113
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I laugh at me.

114
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I laugh at my self.

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Or I'm a doctor.

116
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
So I can look at you from the size as well.

117
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
You can control you not but turning down.

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
You're true, your invention.

119
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:35,460
Dark

120
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,500
Gently goENN

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I think I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling it I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you now I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you I'm telling you

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,500
It's a total spring, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:07:15,500
It's a total spring, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cycl

125
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:45,500
rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every another race, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us let us meet like a cyclone rain, every one of us

126
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
That's an intensive acting group.

127
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,740
And I've got the pod daughter hanging out here at the Crackpot Command Center.

128
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,260
And she's probably going to be bored to tears and she can't turn on the television.

129
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,060
What we're doing the show, of course.

130
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,740
In the morning, everybody in the chat room, we know agenda chat.com.

131
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,340
It seems like we have a couple of issues with the Mibbit service, which is the web-based

132
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,180
interface to get into the IRC chat room.

133
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,900
So the alternatives right now are to find an IRC client for the platform of your choice

134
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,860
and log in that way, or I don't know if it's Mibbit or what's happened, but something

135
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,100
maybe Leo Leport and I just broke it.

136
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,380
That's one of the suggestions coming in through the chat room right now.

137
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,340
But that's okay, because it's a snafu Saturday that means I didn't get to do a show at

138
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
all.

139
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,020
There was nothing happening on the Fubar Friday.

140
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,220
I actually hope to do something on Wednesday.

141
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,220
It's just been a crazy week.

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,860
We've had so much going on, of course, with Christina in town, trying to do as much

143
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,580
stuff with her as possible, and can't wait after the show, we're going to pop on down

144
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,980
to Fry's Electronics in Burbank.

145
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,740
She has no idea what nerd heaven she's about to be thrown into in a pick-up netbook, so

146
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,100
she has something good to use for the next couple of months, while she's back in that

147
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
get-monation east.

148
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,540
Hey, babe, are you here?

149
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
Can I tell him about your plans?

150
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
Yeah.

151
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,780
Plan is, she's going to come back and conquer the United States of America, which I'm very

152
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
excited about.

153
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,220
She's going to set up shop here, and we're looking for a place for her, also later this

154
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
afternoon.

155
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,940
It's going to be fantastic.

156
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Ha!

157
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,940
It's basically my investment in my retirement plan.

158
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,100
She has promised me an old folk, well, what?

159
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:46,740
She's promised me an old folk's home with cable and wireless internet, so it's an investment

160
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,340
in my future.

161
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:55,300
This is the Charlie, it's episode 829-829er for the Delta Shara, and some of our old friends

162
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,500
checking back in as the show starts to crank up again to full speed, nice to hear him

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
all checking in.

164
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,780
Here's our buddy Steve Runner.

165
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,060
Sounds like cowbells.

166
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,500
Yeah, what do you mean?

167
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,300
Everyone here at the Boston Marathon is listening to the D.S.C.

168
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,980
Hey, Adam, it's Steve Runner from the D.P.A.A.A.A.C. podcast for runners over at

169
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
Steve Runner.com.

170
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:31,220
And from the sounds of the crowd here in Boston, I think overwhelmingly everybody is happy about

171
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,260
the return of the daily source code.

172
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,500
Yeah, I'm in the way of the trend of screaming.

173
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I mean, listen to what I mean.

174
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah.

175
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,300
The about half million people out here, and they're all saying the same thing.

176
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,180
Mr. bringing back the D.S.C. man, we've missed your voice out there, and you sound really

177
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,980
been like you in a good space.

178
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,980
Oh, man, I got to tell you Steve, first of all, it's great to hear you.

179
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,500
Yes, I am in a good space.

180
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm feeling fantastic, and it's not just me bringing back the Charlie, it's you guys,

181
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,300
essentially pulling me back into it.

182
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
It's real good to hear you, man.

183
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,220
That sound you hear is me going over a computer math chip.

184
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,420
Oh, you've been to my time, it's being uploaded right now to a server somewhere,

185
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:22,060
so that my listeners can track me as I run, but anyway, thanks so much for returning

186
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,780
back to the airways and this new awakening of yours, it's fascinating to listen to.

187
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,700
Obviously, we've been listening to you over at no agenda, but the SC just warms the

188
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
cockles of our hearts.

189
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Good to hear you, man.

190
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:42,100
It was my podcasting from the Boston, Arizona, on Steve Runner reminding you to one

191
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
long and taper.

192
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Yay!

193
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Go to the SC!

194
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
You night, Chuckleheads!

195
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Oh, yeah, awesome Steve from the Fidipidations podcast.

196
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Thank you so much for checking in my friend.

197
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Good to hear you, you're still running the inshift.

198
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Do you hear me?

199
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Do you care?

200
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Do you hear me?

201
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Do you hear me?

202
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,100
My whole thing in the sounds coming out.

203
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Who is the autobot I am?

204
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,100
I don't fit you real life.

205
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Who underspended?

206
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
You look at me as if you're in a date.

207
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's like the feeling of a humble page with you real life.

208
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You don't know what you just read.

209
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
What was before?

210
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
When no one listens anymore, what was before?

211
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,100
When no one listens, what was before?

212
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,100
When no one listens, what was before?

213
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,100
When no one listens, what was before?

214
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,100
When no one listens, what was before?

215
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
When no one listens, what was before?

216
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,100
When no one listens, what was before?

217
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,100
When no one listens, what was before?

218
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,100
When no one listens, what was before?

219
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
When no one listens, what was before?

220
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,100
When no one listens, what was before?

221
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:29,100
When no one listens, what was before?

222
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I know one is one, one is one, one is one

223
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I know one is one, one is one

224
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
It's no use stopping at all

225
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Do you hear me?

226
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Do you care?

227
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Do you hear me?

228
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Do you care?

229
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Do you care?

230
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Do you?

231
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
Do you care?

232
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Do you care?

233
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,780
And they all they didn't tell me

234
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,100
Being doing blind, no one knows it

235
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,700
I think I'll die in my head, too

236
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,700
The apple boom boom, bombing me

237
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Work out, bomb Bang Bang, bomb out

238
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,120
In the

239
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,280
Until action's coming, and me

240
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,440
What a worse smell, but no one

241
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,000
Listening to eating ball gans

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,720
But no one knows all the words

243
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,720
But no one listens, no one's talking at all

244
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,720
For the worst world, no one listens anymore

245
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,720
For no one listens for the worst world

246
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,720
But no one listens, no one's talking at all

247
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,320
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be laptops

248
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,860
Do youAnyone?

249
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,700
Do you care?

250
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you hear me?

251
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,860
Do you care?

252
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,820
Do you care?

253
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,240
So support the world's hope?

254
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,060
Do you Anyone anyone anyone what's hope?

255
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,160
Do you care?

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,760
Just holding his hands a half an hour

257
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,420
All right, when it comes to quintessential 80s music, that's got to be it, missing

258
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:01,260
verses, words, they really do matter, you know, my stance on that, and I'm just looking

259
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,200
through the archives here, I really need some new jingles for the Charlie new style.

260
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,560
He's kind of hurting on the jingle front, I don't have enough stuff to play, ah, let

261
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,200
me tell you, I'm very excited, you know, I'm setting up a studio here in the Hilltop

262
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,640
Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center in the garage, ah, garage, I should say.

263
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,600
And so I've got, ah, it's completely portable, it's got a great stand with a green

264
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
screen.

265
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,240
I learned a very important lesson for someone who's been in television and video so

266
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,760
long, ah, pretty stupid that I screwed in all my light bulbs using my bare hands.

267
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,800
Of course, the grease from my fingers made two of them pop almost instantaneously, how

268
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,520
new of me to do that, ah, I got this awesome camera, which I forget to make in the

269
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
model of it.

270
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
It's a Panasonic.

271
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,840
It says HD thing that records straight to SD chip.

272
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
So I got all that.

273
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,320
I got a, and by the way, everything off of eBay and Amazon, we really did some research

274
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,560
and, and found some cool stuff.

275
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I got a bitch and tripod with wheels, so I can do truck moves, but here's the kicker.

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,440
You know, for some stuff that I do, particularly when we do stuff for media for, for

277
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,480
client presentations, I need a teleprompter because I, you know, after all the, yeah, we

278
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,960
did some of the short-term memory has gone, I can still do a pretty good job, but I'm

279
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,800
not as good as I used to be.

280
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,200
So I like to have a teleprompter and I'm actually pretty good with a prompter.

281
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,720
You probably usually can't see I'm reading it all, and I know how to float in and out

282
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
of the words.

283
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,800
Look at me that look, I can shut up you, you can't.

284
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,760
So I'm like, I'm looking at prompters, like, you know, 1,200, 1,500 bucks, I'm like,

285
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,400
no, this is crap, man, this is, and then you still have to have a foot pedal or something

286
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
like that.

287
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
We'll check it out.

288
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,720
Check out this, this set up that I, a Jerry rigged.

289
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,280
So first of all, this is great app for the iPad called Teleprompter Plus.

290
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,960
It's 995, which I think is a pretty good bargain.

291
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,040
It lets you import files from Google Docs, it has a lot of ways to get text into it.

292
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,400
You can have a countdown timer.

293
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,920
Of course it does mirror text.

294
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,240
You can set up the fonts and the colors and everything exactly what you'd expect from

295
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,600
a display unit for a teleprompter.

296
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,400
And there's another free app you can get for the iPhone, which lets you control it through

297
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,120
the connection on the, on the Wi-Fi.

298
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,120
So that's, that's the perfect ideal set up.

299
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,520
Now, of course, you don't want this thing underneath the lens or above the lens or to

300
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,800
the right of the left of the lens, because that you will see.

301
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,440
You want to be looking straight into the lens.

302
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,400
So what you typically have with the teleprompter is the screen is beaming upwards.

303
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,280
It hits a, well, someone called it a 2A mirror, but it's actually a beam splitting mirrors.

304
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,000
What it's, is, I think the official terminology.

305
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,120
So I found this outfit, 2A mirrors, I think it's 2A mirrors.com, the 2A mirror company.

306
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,080
And they make a little frame, which is, it's just a wood frame, a tan made, it showed

307
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,840
up with the, with FedEx yesterday, and it cost me 60 bucks.

308
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,000
I've got a beam splitting 2A mirror in there with a nice hood that goes over the camera.

309
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,760
And it, and the iPad fits perfectly right into the, into the bottom frame part.

310
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:26,200
And so, well, if you take away the cost of $800 for the iPad, I have a really, really good

311
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,000
solution, incredibly cost effective for my teleprompter.

312
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,400
So I'll be cranking out stuff left and right pretty soon.

313
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,520
That also has to do with my eye, new eye phone app, which we'll talk about in a second

314
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
of my key.

315
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:41,600

317
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Oh, I think we can make it

318
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
So, though, there's no one this time

319
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
You burn the light in my heart

320
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Well, you put the spot to the side

321
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I got your heart in my side

322
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
You know, I didn't know that

323
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Oh, when I was down, I was a cry

324
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it

325
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
I gave you my heart

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
I gave you my heart

327
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
You know, I'm bringing my heart

328
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I don't know where to get your heart

329
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I don't know where to get my heart

330
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Oh, when I was down, I was a cry

331
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
You know, I didn't know that

332
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Oh, when I was down, I was a cry

333
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
You ran from the sky, I gave you my heart

334
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Oh, I gave you my heart

335
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I don't know where to get your heart

336
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
I don't know where to get your heart

337
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I don't know where to get my heart

338
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I don't know where to get my heart

339
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I don't know where to get my heart

340
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I don't know where to get my heart

341
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
So, good news for those of you listening at No AgendaStream.com

342
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
The chat is back up and working

343
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
You can log in at noagendachat.com

344
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,980
It fixed itself miraculously and of course immediately guys in the chat room

345
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,920
We're saying hey any porn stars here today. This is what happens when we do the show live

346
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,840
Yeah, I don't know as a little early for most of the porn stars to be checking into the chat room

347
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,580
Elton John Kiki D real pussy music on the Charlie, but it's great for a snap-oos Saturday

348
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:57,440
Just kind of makes you feel good. Yeah, we need that a little bit of a mellow happy music can't go too hard on you

349
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,920
Yeah, as he said hard on you can't go too hard on you on a Saturday morning

350
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:09,160
I particularly since it's only 11 30 and we're just kind of waking up and chilling out sitting here my sweats and

351
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,960
And no wife beater today, by the way. It's just the white t-shirt. So I mentioned the iPhone app

352
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I submitted it on Sunday and

353
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:26,120
It was waiting for review now last night 7 p.m. Get Monation West time. It switched to in review

354
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,200
So they're reviewing my iPhone app. I cannot tell you how I mean, I'm like a like a teenager on a first date here

355
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,640
It's like I'm I'm very excited about this thing. I hope they approve it. I'm I know that on some of the

356
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,280
There are human interface guidelines. I'm scurting around some of the

357
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,800
Well, the guidelines I guess so I don't know if if they understand what I'm trying to do with the app

358
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,880
Then they'll get it and they'll be okay with it if not I'm gonna have to either

359
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,240
Put some significant infrastructure behind it or

360
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,720
Make it Wi-Fi only which is something I don't want to do

361
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,200
Because it's it's so cool although I must say when you have a shitty connection like when you switch from 3G to Edge

362
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,440
Then it really it really doesn't perform at all and or very well and so I would understand if they rejected on those grounds

363
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,360
I'm just hoping it doesn't take now the four days to get back into review if they rejected it and maybe they'll just approve it

364
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,240
Because I'm very excited about this thing. It's

365
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:37,600
It's you know, I'm I'm not a a massive coder and it's not so much that the app does amazing things, but it is the perfect

366
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,760
I don't want to give it away. I want you to load it on your iPhone and and see if the magic appears before you're very eyes

367
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,360
That's that's rude. That's really I've done something and once it's been approved

368
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,560
I'll tell you exactly how I did it and why I did it and and

369
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,800
What the point is but it's really going to help anyone out there who's making iPhone apps

370
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,480
So take that to heart if you're a developer or a even if you're just a content producer and you're you're

371
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:14,120
Working with someone else putting apps together my app will help your app and it's going to be completely free which is

372
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I so believe in that

373
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,760
People who've seen this app who've been reviewing it with me say so what's the business model behind this if it's free?

374
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:31,200
It's not on and I you don't understand I got to build the audience first then everything just comes automatically or automatically. Should we say

375
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Real proof is in the no agenda stream.com project the John and I are doing a no agenda in general

376
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,480
You know when people like it they'll help you out if they don't like it if the think it sucks

377
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
They don't it's that simple

378
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,680
But of course, it's just the beginning the first of many apps

379
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,280
Only just begun that words of Karen Carpenter

380
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm sure you've had it all before but you never really had it out

381
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

382
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:55,680
Sharon rises that all through to us watching the signs along the way

383
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Talking it all the girls are too far

384
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:09,680
We're getting together together

385
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Today was gonna be the day but I'll never throw it back to you

386
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,680
But now you shut up somehow realize watching that to do

387
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:29,680
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

388
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Just think of

389
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Sharon rises that all new to us watching the signs along the way

390
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Talking it all the girls are too far

391
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,680
We're getting together today

392
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Together

393
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Together

394
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,680
You're gonna be the one that saves me

395
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,680
And after all

396
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,680
You're my one to one

397
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:40,680
I don't know man I kind of liked that one

398
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,680
It's go home productions mash up with the carpenters and Oasis called Carpenter's Wonderwall

399
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,680
It's kind of struck me perfectly right for us now food Saturday edition of the Charlie

400
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Where we once again welcome back one of our old friends in one of our charcoal heads ray on the Charlie

401
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,680
We interrupt this program to bring you this news flash

402
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,680
I ran expected to launch military exercise in the Persian Gulf this week

403
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Does anyone know what's happening there

404
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,680
So it's going to be a beautiful weekend in Europe

405
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Sun in the sky birds whistling great tunes

406
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,680
It was a great experience last week to hear almost nothing

407
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
It's interesting things in the open air which no one had seen since 1911

408
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,680
That was the first year a small airplane flew over the Netherlands

409
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I really enjoyed to see and hear things I usually don't see or hear

410
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Or feel are we shaking more and more or it gets just my imagination

411
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Or in bladder if there are not a week of major and smaller earthquakes around the globe

412
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I finally read in the Dutch newspaper the answer to all my questions

413
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Earthquakes are not natural but caused by unruly muslim women

414
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,680
It says the Iranian cleric who got all this slum gazem said digi

415
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Iranian women dressed far too exposed

416
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,680
It brings ahead of many men going nuts

417
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,680
So they provide for adultery and that's why the number of earthquakes in Iran is increasing

418
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,680
So Adam that's maybe a solution to our problem

419
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
No more naked chicks around the globe

420
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
NAY

421
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Last Wednesday it was for 20 day

422
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,680
April the 20th is a special day to a certain facet of society

423
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,680
I at the other end had to do some research on the internet to learn about this great event in Denver

424
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,680
After we went through the Iceland major cloud of anesthes

425
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,680
The clock pounded down at 420 p.m. for a crowd of more than 1000 bucks mogers

426
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,680
To lit up the splits and wait for the airports and Colorado to be shut down after a while

427
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
They probably see things flying anyway

428
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,680
So in the meantime, our Dutch Christian democratic political party things

429
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Handing out free joints during the parliamentary elections in the Netherlands on June 9th is irresponsible

430
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,680
14 coffee shops in Mastricht

431
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
That's a capital city in the Netherlands

432
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Once to reward loyal customers with a free joint as they vote

433
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Can you believe that?

434
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Welcome

435
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,680
So the good news is in spite of what you inhale it's going to be a beautiful weekend

436
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,680
In the lower countries temperatures for the first time this year rising about the 20 degrees

437
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,680
It's finally spring and I'm definitely ready for the weekend

438
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Starting right here on the Charlie

439
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,680
This might be crossing the line

440
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,680
But it's time to just find it

441
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,680
But it's going to be just striking to me

442
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Maybe what you got to do

443
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Say it's all free

444
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,680
I know I'm on the floor

445
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I want to be just like you

446
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I want to be taking this room

447
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Turn down the walls and something

448
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Yeah, I'm taking this

449
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,680
You see, it's greener

450
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
This is so much fun

451
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
It's easy

452
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
It makes me so bright

453
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
Yeah

454
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm so excited about what I want

455
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,680
After a spots of the teenagers

456
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
No more chicks

457
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Don't be afraid

458
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,680
I'll just teach you a little and let it go

459
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
I want to be just like you

460
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,680
I want to be taking this room

461
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Turn down the walls and something

462
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Yeah, I'm taking this room

463
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
I want to be just like you

464
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,680
I want to be taking this room

465
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Yeah, I got a lot of some surgesmith on the knowledge industry

466
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm daily source code episode 829

467
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Thank you very much

468
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Ray for your ray on the Charlie

469
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
That's kind of a good wrap up for the week

470
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm really liking that

471
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
You know in there

472
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
And yeah, Ash McGetting

473
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Of course, we were all over that for the beginning

474
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
On the knowledge and

475
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Oh, gee, what is that even Richard Branson's coming out and saying

476
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Hey, that was pretty bogus

477
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
That made no sense

478
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Why the hell that we have to ground everybody

479
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Well, tomorrow morning in the morning at early service

480
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
No agenda, I'm sure we'll talk about that some more

481
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
But yeah, it must have been nice to have the sky

482
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
It's just completely clear

483
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Cleaned nothing flying around and no controls

484
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,680
For a change

485
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
But boy, what a rip off that was

486
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,680
And I got a 19 year old hero who was hoping for another eruption

487
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
So she could stay longer

488
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Unfortunately, no such luck

489
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Not often we play an instrumental on the Charlie

490
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,680
But that got a really nice email that came in from Mike Snyder

491
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,680
And you say as I got a track for you that I did

492
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
It's totally pod safe

493
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
No problem if you don't do instrumentals

494
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I understand

495
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,680
But anyway, I promise you my song does not suck

496
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680

They are very nice

612
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,640
very nice Mike, thank you so much, well spoken guitar, pod safe and he didn't give

613
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,840
me a link. I'd love to hear some more. Oh, there it is. Yeah, I'll put that in the show

614

notes at datingsourcecode.com. MSCGP, Mike Shira, Charlie Golf, Papa, dot wordpress.com.

615
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,280
You know, I got to tell you, I'm sitting here with iTunes Connect Open, not just during

616
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,400
the show, but pretty much ever since it changed to going in review. I'm not quite sure

617
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,000
why it takes so long to review the app. But I guess they need their time to figure it out.

618
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,840
You know, and I mentioned it's like, I'm like a teenager. It's like, I feel like I've

619
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,000
gotten the first base. I mean, review now. Will I get to go to second, third and will I

620
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,520
score? Can I go all the way home? Oh, baby, I'd love to. You know, how sometimes something

621
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,600
can really ruin a song? Well, the Clintons ruin this song when they use it for their

622
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,560
campaign. But I think it's time to bring it back and it can be played again because it

623
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,600
is a great tune. This Fleetwood Mac don't stop on daily source code eight two nine

624
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:55,600
four. You never don't want to smile. If it takes just a little while, over your eyes,

625
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:06,600
forget the day, you'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you're not too much, don't stop.

626
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:21,600
You'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way.

627
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way.

628
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way.

00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Don't stop. You'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way. Don't stop, you'll say things in a new way.

630
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Yeah, baby, we're all up before

631
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Yes, we're this girl, yes, we're this girl

632
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Oh, I don't know this is me who's mine

633
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Give the face closer to my heart

634
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I know you don't be that it's true

635
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I've never met any harm to you

636
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Don't stop, and I'm out tomorrow

637
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Don't stop, you don't see me

638
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Give the face closer to my heart

639
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Yes, we're this girl, yes, we're this girl

640
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Don't stop, and I'm out tomorrow

641
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Don't stop, you don't see me

642
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Give the face closer to my heart

643
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Yes, we're this girl, yes, we're this girl

644
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,600
You know what I mean?

645
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
You know what I mean?

646
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
It's like, I hated it when the Clinton did that

647
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I hated when politicians co-op songs in general

648
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,600
It's like politicizing art, man, it's no good

649
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
So, what was that now?

650
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Ten years ago, so I guess we're okay to bring it back

651
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Out of the closet and play it again, it's just a good ass song

652
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Fleetwood Mac don't stop on the Charlie 829

653
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Are these snafu set or day edition

654
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,600
And we've been seeing lots of friends of the Charlie coming back

655
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,600
and reintroducing themselves to the new audience

656
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
To the old audience

657
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Great to have them all coming back

658
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Of course, comic strip blogger

659
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
We'll check in later on this program as well

660
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,600
And I think it was two or three episodes ago

661
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I inadvertently thank Jersey Todd

662
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,600
For sending in some tunes, of course, I'm in to say, Jersey Joe

663
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
Had quite a tough time in self over the past couple of years

664
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
And it was great to catch up with him

665
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
And see the things are going well

666
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
And I don't know if it was just the karma

667
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Or if the mistake made it happen

668
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
But, ladies and gentlemen, I probably present the return

669
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Of the music colleges, the official musicologist

670
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Of the David source code

671
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
You're honored, I'd like to make a motion

672
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,600
To rock this mother out

673
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,600
You're honored, please don't bang that gavel

674
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,600
You can try this cowbell out

675
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,600
And it's all give a knock

676
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
To the hardest work in law here

677
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,600
It's Jersey Todd and Megan

678
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,600
It's Jersey Todd and Megan

679
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
You're honored, what do you say?

680
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,600
He might even fit with this case

681
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,600
Jersey, you said I'd be dead yet

682
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Jersey, you said I'd be dead

683
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,600
Jersey, you said I'd be sure

684
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Now, you're Jersey, you said

685
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
Hey, how's it going Adam?

686
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,600
It's Jersey Todd, the official musicologist

687
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Of the Chacha

688
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Damn that feels good to say once again

689
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Man, I've missed a DSC

690
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Well, I'm glad you're back

691
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I hope all's well on your role

692
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
Man, it sounds like you've seen more lawyers than I have lately

693
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
But she's, you know, things have been crazy over here too

694
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
Since we've last talked

695
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,600
The kids are getting bigger, Robin, my daughter

696
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Who was essentially born on the DSC

697
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Wait a minute

698
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Is she dateable yet?

699
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,600
As we texted back and forth back in the day

700
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
During her birth, I was texting you from the delivery room

701
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,600
She's already three years old

702
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
I saw Charlie five years old

703
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,600
So things are a little crazy

704
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
I'm no longer an associate at the front of my work for

705
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
I'm now the big partner

706
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
So, I'm back as your musicologist

707
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm happy to do it

708
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
I'll check in as much as I can

709
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,600
But the nice thing about the new DSC

710
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Is even though we still love pot safe music

711
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,600
On your show, I can play whatever I want

712
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
And we're not just limited to pot safe music

713
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,600
That's right

714
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
So, hey, what do I care?

715
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
You don't want to be in suit right?

716
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
And I got a lot of pot parts of it

717
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
From noise in the UK

718
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
This is one of my favorite bands

719
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Got to check out the album, the house and dirt built

720
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,600
It's the heavy on the daily songs called

721
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
How you like me now?

722
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Jersey Todd, good to have you back

723
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Thank you so much, can't wait to check out the tunes

724
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
Coming from you

725
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Now you need to know

726
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,600
I'll see you up in the back

727
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Back, back, back, back

728
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,600
And I'm in a deal

729
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Yeah, I'm out of fire

730
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
And you'll uphold this man

731
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,600
Think and wait till you see

732
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,600
I can't wait

733
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
Say you don't know

734
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
I need to know

735
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,600
I need to know

736
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I need to know

737
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,600
I need to know

738
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,600
I need to know

739
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
I need to know

740
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,600
I need to know

741
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Remember to film

742
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,600
Where I need to go

743
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Yeah, I was alive

744
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:56,600
And that you can't even get almost to see

745
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:02,600
Oh, now what you see right through me

746
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Get the same sense and sense on the book you've been dreaming of

747
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,600
Put your knees out, now, coming down

748
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,840
I ain't like it nor, I ain't like, I ain't like me, man

749
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,240
I ain't like it, man

750
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,240
I ain't allowed, man

751
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,760
I ain't allowed, man

752
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,360
I ain't allowed, man

753
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,480
I ain't allowed, man

754
00:47:40,600 --> 00:48:10,140
We're going on Begin with the

755
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,140
It's time to make you fall in pain

756
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,140
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes

757
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:40,140
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes

758
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,140
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes

759
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,140
Oh yeah, Regnet Snorsko,Where compression leaps

760
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,140
perfhечe beheee

761
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,140
Jersey Tan, thank you so much my friend

762
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,980
And the official music college is not the trot, trot,

763
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,740
check him back in, I'm sure I'll be back sometime next week.

764
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,340
By the way, this coming week, I'm going to be in San Francisco

765
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,420
for a major portion of the days.

766
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,700
As first of all, I'm going to be taking Christina,

767
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,860
as she's flying out of the SFO, and we're both very sad about it.

768
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,220
All three of us are sad about her leaving.

769
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,900
I had really sucks, but she'll be back in, I give her six weeks.

770
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,460
She thinks it's going to be two months,

771
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,980
but I think it's going to be even less time than that.

772
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,940
And then I'm going to be working at the office.

773
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,460
So I don't know about a Charlie, because I've

774
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,020
kind of gotten to this new mode of traveling only

775
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,460
taking the iPad, because I don't really need any more.

776
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,540
And I hate striking down my entire setup,

777
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,580
once it's set up, it's really rocks.

778
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,580
And by the way, there's this fantastic service

779
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,180
that I've been using for a number of years called

780
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,740
LogMeIn.com, which is a free service.

781
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,540
You can access all of your computer's via remote.

782
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,140
It's very similar to VNC.

783
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,540
In fact, I think it even uses the VNC protocol

784
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,700
probably in the background there.

785
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,380
But the good thing about it is they essentially

786
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,860
have a location service, so you don't have to go routing

787
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:09,540
around for IP addresses and do all kinds of NAT translation,

788
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,220
network address translation, tricks to VNC,

789
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,060
and it just kind of works.

790
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,100
And even though that's free, the iPhone and iPad versions

791
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,340
of the app are rather expensive.

792
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,140
I think there's like 20 bucks, but man does it work well.

793
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,460
So if I need anything from the computer at home,

794
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,740
I can just log right into it.

795
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,820
And it's just really kicks ass.

796
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,700
I got an interesting email.

797
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,340
And as you know, I'm trying to do more with the music

798
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,980
on the daily source code, despite the fact

799
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,540
that there are lots of things to talk about going on the world.

800
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,220
And I do want to talk specifically about this porn stuff

801
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,940
going on at the SEC, and how that will affect us all

802
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,020
and what I think the, and I'll probably talk about it in the

803
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,900
morning as well, early service tomorrow.

804
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,700
How that, that is going to be used for evil ways.

805
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,500
But the email just kind of got my, my attention.

806
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,900
It starts off dear Adam, forget about unpronounceable Icelandic

807
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,180
volcanoes.

808
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,820
The only sound eruptions you need to be wrapping your ears

809
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,180
around this week are right here.

810
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,860
We've got two molten hot new remixes for you of our debut

811
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,980
single, 61, 74.

812
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,660
And this is from Don't Wait a Minute.

813
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,300
At least that's the, the sender on the email.

814
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,660
We met coin-operated boy at a warehouse party in white

815
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,540
chapel last month.

816
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,300
He promised us a remix of our track,

817
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,300
despite intoxications on both sides of that conversation,

818
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,500
which is always the start of some great art, my friends,

819
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,580
editorial provided by me.

820
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,220
He followed through with his word, and we're glad he did,

821
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,460
as he provides for us a garage-flavored reinterpretation

822
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,700
of Don't Wait animates original track with a healthy dollop

823
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,140
of Parallan-esque glitchy electronica.

824
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,500
We think it's pretty epic.

825
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,460
And with a different take on the track, we've got some techno-pop

826
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,340
hybrid with a distinct Euro-pop vibe courtesy of Dirty Disco.

827
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,220
That's next on the Daily Source Code.

828
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:23,660
Let's get started.

829
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,340
I don't go in.

830
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,540
Ah.

831
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,340
Ah.

832
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,340
Ah.

833
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,340
Ah.

834
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,340
Ah.

835
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340
Ah.

836
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
Ah.

837
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,340
Ah.

838
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,340
Ah.

839
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,340
Ah.

840
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Ah.

841
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,340
Ah.

842
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,340
Ah.

843
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,340
Ah.

844
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,020
Ah.

845
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,020
Oh my god, that's too much

846
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
So, let's now look at the show

847
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,020
Time to go, let's take a long shower

848
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
We'll never change our mind

849
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,020
I'm the morning, you're my cookin' better

850
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,020
That's not true, let's take a selfie

851
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,020
Coming name up on the break

852
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,020
Oh the love, let's go to sleep now

853
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
No, what you see the hours

854
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,020
See the lady think, oh the weather like a cow

855
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,020
It's hot in the waves

856
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,020
Like a life that's not true

857
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
The pounce became panties

858
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,020
But a pound went from flatchy

859
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,020
And no, the cow was bored

860
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,020
And no, the cow was bored

861
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:40,020
And no, the cow was bored

862
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:44,020
And no, the cow was bored

863
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
And no, the cow was bored

864
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,020
And no, the cow was bored

865
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,020
And no, the cow was bored

866
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
And no, the cow was bored

867
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,020
And no, the cow was bored

868
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
And no, the cow was bored

869
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,020
And no, the cow was bored

870
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,020
And no, the cow was bored

871
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,020
And no, the cow was bored

872
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
And no, the cow was bored

873
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,020
And no, the cow was bored

874
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,020
And no, the cow was bored

875
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,020
And no, the cow was bored

876
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,020
And no, the cow was bored

877
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,020
And no, the cow was bored

878
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,020
And no, the cow was bored

879
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,020
And no, the cow was bored

880
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,020
And no, the cow was bored

881
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,020
And no, the cow was bored

882
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,020
And no, the cow was bored

883
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,020
And no, the cow was bored

00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,020
And no, the cow was bored

885
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,020
And no, the cow was bored

886
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,020
And no, the cow was bored

887
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,020
And no, the cow was bored

888
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,020
And no, the cow was bored

889
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,020
And no, the cow was bored

890
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,020
And no, the cow was bored

891
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,020
And no, the cow was bored

892
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,020
And no, the cow was bored

893
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,020
And no, the cows was bored

894
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,020
And no, the cow was bored

895
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,020
And no, the cow was bored

896
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,020
And no, the cow was bored

897
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,020
And no, the cow was bored

898
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,020
And no, the cow was bored

899
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,020
And no, the cow was bored

900
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,020
And no, the cow was bored

901
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:42,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

902
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:49,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

903
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

904
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

905
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,020
It could also only get worse for guests that either

906
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

907
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:29,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

908
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:34,020
It could only get worse for guests that are

909
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:41,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

910
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:48,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

911
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:56,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

912
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:03,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

913
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:33,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

914
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:41,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

915
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:47,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

916
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:52,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

917
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:57,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that'sULL

918
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,020
Take it out like this, yeah, that's all

919
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,020
Take it out again when it's bored, yeah, that's all

920
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,680
Take it out

921
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,420
Take it out

922
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,420
and now this really reminds me of those days.

923
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,420
I'm in it too, you know?

924
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,420
I do like it.

925
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,420
Awesome.

926
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,420
Don't wait a minute.

927
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,420
It's 6174.

928
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,420
It is the COB remix.

929
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:35,420
And of course, links to all of the tracks played on the daily source code can be found.

930
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,420
In the show notes, a daily source code dot com.

931
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,420
People asking me, you're not just playing potsafe music,

932
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,420
why you're playing non-potsafe tunes as well.

933
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,420
And it's very very simple.

934
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,420
It's basically a Vulcan mind trick.

935
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,420
You see, if you want to get people to hear other tunes,

936
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,420
you've got to make them happy and you've got to play something familiar.

937
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,420
Something they really like.

938
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,420
Something that's been around for a while.

939
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,420
You rarely hear me play Beyonce, by the way,

940
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,420
or something that's current on the track on the charts.

941
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,420
You have to do it.

942
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,420
It's how you put a show together.

943
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,420
If you go to a David Bowie show,

944
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,420
he's going to play some stuff from the spiders from Mars.

945
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,420
He'll play something off the heroes album.

946
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,420
Then he'll play something off of whatever's latest project is.

947
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,420
And I encourage every band to make sure they do their hits.

948
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,420
You've got to mix the hits with the new stuff.

949
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,420
Otherwise, people just won't listen.

950
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,420
It's what it takes.

951
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,420
Ah, okay.

952
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,420
Ah, what should I talk about here?

953
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,420
Oh, yeah.

954
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,420
I had a great meeting yesterday with Dave Matthews.

955
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:44,420
Now, Dave Matthews is probably the closest thing to an inventor,

956
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,420
a person that I know.

957
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,420
He's created a lot of amazing stuff.

958
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,420
He has a lot of patents on things.

959
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,420
And he's just a great guy.

960
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,420
And he was very much a Bay Area resident for a while.

961
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,420
And we both moved Los Angeles around the same time.

962
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,420
So we hook up from time to time.

963
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,420
We had a meeting yesterday.

964
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,420
Oh, so LA Friday afternoon at the Skybar,

965
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,420
La Mondrian Hotel.

966
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:14,420
And I laid out a project for him that I'm very interested in pursuing.

967
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,420
He Dave was really good with his hands and with metal.

968
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,420
And he can make things.

969
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,420
And he's got a tool shop and he can do stuff, right?

970
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,420
And I, of course, have none of that.

971
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,420
I'm very bad with my hands, actually,

972
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,420
except for certain things.

973
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,420
But that's for another show.

974
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,420
When Bobby's back in the chat room.

975
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,420
I've been following this guy called John Surrell.

976
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:43,420
And he's an inventor and he's been working on free energy

977
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,420
or zero point to whatever you want to call it

978
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,420
for many, many years in the United Kingdom.

979
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,420
And it was someone who sent me the link of him on coast to coast A.M.

980
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,420
And I had missed this particular episode.

981
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,420
He was interviewed via phone.

982
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:01,420
And he essentially is, I think, the granddaddy of the idea of creating free energy

983
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,420
through magnets, magnetism.

984
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,420
And he has the system called the Cyril Effect Generator.

985
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,420
You can see tons of examples on it on, of it on YouTube.

986
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,420
In fact, some Hollywood producer and I made a movie about him called

987
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,420
the Cyril Story.

988
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,420
I think it's the CyrilStory.com.

989
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,420
As Sierra Echo Alpha Romeo Lima.

990
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,420
And that, of course, is a typical Hollywood production.

991
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,420
You know, it's like, it doesn't work.

992
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,420
It doesn't not.

993
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,420
You decide.

994
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,420
And one of those deals.

995
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,420
Now, I'm pretty much a believer in this stuff.

996
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,420
I see a lot of guys down under working on generators based on magnets.

997
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,420
And they're, you know, they're essentially hooking up nine

998
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,420
volts and getting 15 kilo volts out.

999
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,420
It's amazing or kilowatts.

1000
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,420
Whatever.

1001
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,420
I mean, it seems like this stuff was working, of course.

1002
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,420
It goes against the grain of anyone who doesn't think that a,

1003
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,420
the perpetual motion can exist, et cetera.

1004
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,420
But there's one interesting aspect.

1005
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,420
And the free energy aspect is one thing.

1006
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,420
It's actually what Dave was most interested in when I told him this story.

1007
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:09,420
What I really like about what John Cyril is doing is this,

1008
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,420
this generator of his has an interesting side effect.

1009
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,420
And the side effect is that it will levitate.

1010
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,420
And not just levitate like, you know, a little bit off the table.

1011
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,420
It actually, in his experiments,

1012
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,420
some of these rotating discs that he's created have,

1013
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,420
you know, actually shot through the roof of his shack.

1014
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,420
And he's flown them.

1015
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,420
And it looks very much like a flying saucer.

1016
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,420
And so here's the deal I made with Dave,

1017
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:42,420
who was interested in the, in the free energy aspect of it.

1018
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:44,420
I said, look, man, if, if we can make one of these,

1019
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,420
if we can make them work.

1020
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,420
And he has a lot of connections with a lot of the hackers and the freaks

1021
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,420
who go to a burning man who have, you know, have stuff like,

1022
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,420
you know, super magnets line around in their shed.

1023
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,420
Oh, I got a draw full of those.

1024
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,420
If we can actually make it work,

1025
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,420
I told him I would fly it.

1026
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,420
And I can't wait.

1027
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,420
And I have faith.

1028
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:12,420
I think we can take to the skies, baby.

1029
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,420
All right.

1030
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,420
If it was something to turn out.

1031
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,420
Yeah.

1032
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,420
Oh, nice.

1033
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,420
The angels.

1034
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,420
They're the source.

1035
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,420
They're a two-niner.

1036
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,420
Take them on time.

1037
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,420
Oh.

1038
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,420
Oh.

1039
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,420
Oh.

1040
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,420
Oh.

1041
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,420
Salem Boys stars from a paper stand with whisky bottle in naves

1042
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,300

1043
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:47,400
慢慢 hope I can t see, the science out, can head my shadow up.

1044
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
For our memories take inside ofdev Pinecrot.

Take a long ride.

1048

Take a long ride, take a long ride

1049
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,220
Take a long ride, I'll be with you

1050
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,220
Try to look into the game of mine

1051
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:13,220
Tell them just take a side to my sacred ride

1052
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,220
The king is sick, you ain't got no right to come

1053
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,220
That's it, get out of my sight

1054
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:23,220
Take a long ride, take a long ride

1055
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,220
Take a long ride, I'll be with you

1056
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:58,220
Take a long ride, take a long ride

1057
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:07,220
The king is sick, you ain't got no right to come

1058
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,220
That's it, get out of my sight

1059
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:14,220
Take a long ride, take a long ride

1060
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,220
Take a long ride, take a long ride

1061
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,220
Take a long ride, I'll be with you

1062
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,220
You give them a smile, a lot of them all alone

1063
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,220
It's an I've never exactly given myself time

1064
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:30,220
Take a long life, take a long life

1065
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:37,220
Take a long life, take a long life

1066
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,220
Take a long life, take a long life

1067

Take a long life, take a long life

1069
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,220
Yeah, we're in a moment, take a long ride

1070
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,220
Less talk like pirates

1071
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:09,220
We are the pilots, we know too any lead

1072
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,220
We say no, we lie around

1073
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,220
And if you task us

1074
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:18,220
Do anything, we'll tell you, we don't do anything

1075
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,220
But I'll never be, then I'll never be

1076
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,220
Then I'll never be, then I'll never be

1077
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,220
So let's say we all say all, then I'll never be

1078
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:29,220
I'll stay with, I'll never be, then I'll never be

1079
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,220
I'll stay with, I'll never be, then I'll never be

1080
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,220
I'll stay with, I'll never be, then I'll never be

1081
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,220
I'll stay with, I'll never be, then I'll never be

1082
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,220
I'll stay with, I'll never be, then I'll never be

1083
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be, then I'll never be

1084
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:40,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be, then I'll never be

1085
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be, then I'll never be

1086
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be

1087
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be, then I'll never be

1088
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be

1089
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:52,220
I'll never be, then I'll never be, then I'll never be

1090
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:07,220
Justin 23, don't do anything,'t do anything

1091
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,220
Justin 27, don't do anything

1092
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,460
I'll do it again!

1093
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,120
Wow!

1094
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,120
Fuck the rest of it, I'm not too good.

1095
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,660
I'm gonna pop it up, throw my meth potatoes,

1096
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,860
forget the wall, and I'll never cancel it.

1097
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,800
You're walking out, never got me at last.

1098
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:24,300
And I'll never be in the ball, and I'll never be in the ball.

1099
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,200
By your acceptance love, 2002,

1100
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,300
we'll be this bad way like a king.

1101
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,500
That way I need a soul full of confidence.

1102
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,780
We don't know why you did over time,

1103
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,620
and can't take kids.

1104
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,780
We don't wait for a lunch, but we don't need y'all.

1105
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,280
We can't take crush, we don't fall, we don't shoot.

1106
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,820
We must get the cake a rule.

1107
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:45,220
I'll do it again, let's get money here.

1108
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,780
Go on, go on, go on.

1109
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,780
Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on.

1110
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,780
We just make it all, we'll lie around.

1111
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,780
We have to run, do it again,

1112
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,780
we'll tell you, we don't do it again.

1113
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,780
Yes!

1114
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,780
Ha! Let's get the fun going.

1115
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,780
If you don't do it again, I love this.

1116
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,780
Oh, my God!

1117
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,780
Nice!

1118
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,380
You are the star of the student,

1119
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,780
Brendan, Brendan,

1120
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,780
we're the sound of you, we don't play the band.

1121
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,780
Hey, don't do anything like you were doing.

1122
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,780
Sorry, Boris!

1123
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,780
I don't know why I don't want to play anymore.

1124
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,780
I don't want to sing this song.

1125
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,780
I want to play the band.

1126
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,780
I don't want to know to the more.

1127
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,780
I don't want to play the band.

1128
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,780
I don't want to listen at all.

1129
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,780
I want to play the band.

1130
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,780
I want to play the band.

1131
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,780
I want to get high school.

1132
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,780
Sorry, I want to play the band.

1133
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,780
I don't want to turn the train.

1134
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,780
I don't want to see a play.

1135
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,780
I don't want to use turning.

1136
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,780
I want to play the band.

1137
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,780
I want to play the band.

1138
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,780
I want to get high school.

1139
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,780
I want to play the band.

1140
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:12,780
I don't wanna play, don't need time

1141
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:17,780
I don't wanna play, don't need time

1142
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:22,780
I want to play, don't need time

1143
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:28,780
I don't wanna play, don't need time

1144
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:35,780
I want to play in parking

I wanna get high Alrighty pay with me

1146
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:43,780
I want to blame for everything I want to give myself

1147
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:47,780
I want to blame for everything I want to give myself

1148
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,780
Yo! Oh, that's so really good

1149
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,780
Just a little bit of punk, the punk corner on the tour

1150
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,780
And I don't want to blame the fender

1151
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,780
Comix dripping

1152
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,780
Comix dripping

1153
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:03,780
Comix dripping

1154
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:07,780
Comix dripping

1155
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,780
Come on, he is my e-friend

1156
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,780
Hello Adam for 20k

1157
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,780
Former for 20...

01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,780
But I still celebrate in spirit

1159
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,780
So I am all

01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,780
guns and on

1162
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,780
I am focussing on the future and stuff

1163
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,780
But I might say I am apart

1164
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,780
By too high-est e-o officials

1165
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,780
Oh...

Oh, well, they talked about it after

1168
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:41,380
President of the Repian Commission and the guy who you know the guy who gave cause

1169
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,180
the EU jobs to his Portuguese pal.

1170
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,580
Oh yeah, all the guys at Total Bastard go look at his wiki pedi a page.

1171
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,580
I mean even that has stuff that you won't believe.

1172
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:56,460
He's from Portugal and by I'm angry by Hermann Van Rampoy, the president of the

1173
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:57,460
European Council.

1174
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,460
Oh yes.

1175
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,460
Heiko Hermann.

1176
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,100
And also a target of many many jokes by yourself.

1177
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,100
Oh yeah.

1178
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,100
He's a total dickhead.

1179
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,100
Why not?

1180
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,700
He's the president of the United States of Europe and all he's doing is reading his high

1181
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,700
coups.

1182
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,700
And by your boyfriend it worked.

1183
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:21,420
And you know what I'm angry, I have to tell you, these two bosos both and Van Rampoy

1184
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:29,220
didn't come to funeral of Polish president and they make it on the S. I mean come on.

1185
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:35,820
They could just drive through Germany with cars and quickly on the funeral.

1186
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,780
They didn't have to cross all shen or see or anything.

1187
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:45,620
So I must admit that you're remarks about him and Van Rampoy as spot on you.

1188
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,620
Yo.

1189
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,620
Yeah.

1190
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,620
Total Bastard.

1191
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:55,580
I'm sure we're talking about Heiko Hermann more in the morning early service at noagendashow.com.

1192
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,220
Yo.

1193
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,220
Dave Kossemi this.

1194
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:09,220
Dave is a founding producer of the noagendastream.com website.

1195
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,220
Showing his support.

1196
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:19,220
Not just for the stream but also for the Charlie.

1197
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:22,220
Journey little mouth.

1198
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,220
Undressed me.

1199
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:27,220
A link in the show notes to the video which is hot.

1200
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:33,220
If you're not hologram tricks that is.

1201
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:37,220
You can only guess what that video's like.

1202
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,220
Take it now.

1203
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:23,220
Yeah.

1204
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,220
Have you ever been faced?

1205
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,220
No face with temptation.

1206
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,220
Better than race.

1207
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:37,220
For the next morning I'll show you what I look at you.

1208
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,220
Orange nose.

1209
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,220
Time to meet her.

1210
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:46,220
Oh she won't stop looking at me.

1211
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,220
It's a surprise I expected.

1212
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,220
Take it now.

1213
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,220
Take it now.

1214
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,220
Take it now.

1215
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,220
Take it now.

1216
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,220
Take it now.

1217
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,220
Take it now.

1218
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Take it now.

1219
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,220
Take it now.

1220
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,220
Take it now.

1221
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,220
Take it now.

1222
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,220
Take it now.

1223
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,220
Take it now.

1224
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,220
Take it now.

1225
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,220
Take it now.

1226
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,220
Take it now.

1227
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,220
Take it now.

1228
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,220
Take it now.

1229
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,220
Take it now.

1230
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,220
Take it now.

1231
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,220
Take it now.

1232
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,220
Take it now.

1233
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,220
Take it now.

1234
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,220
Take it now.

1235
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,220
Take it now.

1236
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,220
Take it now.

1237
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,220
Take it now.

1238
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,220
Take it now.

1239
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,220
Take it now.

1240
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,220
You are my fantasy.

1241
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,220
Take it now.

1242
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,220
Take it now.

1243
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,220
Take it now.

1244
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,220
Take it now.

1245
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,220
Take it now.

1246
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,220
Take it now.

1247
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,920
Take it now.

1248
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,220
Take it.

1249
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,220
Take it.

1250
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,220
Take it now.

1251
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,220
Take it now.

1252
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,220
Take it now.

1253
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,220
Take it now.

1254
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,220
Take it now.

1255
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,220
Take it now.

1256
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,220
Take it now.

1257
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,220
Take it now.

1258
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,220
Take it now.

1259
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,220
Take it now.

1260
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,220
Do it now.

1261
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,220
Take it now.

1262
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,220
Take it now.

1263
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:53,220
There's no question, she's too fun

1264
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:59,220
Tell me, yeah, for the ride of my life

1265
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:03,220
Who do you want me to go?

1266
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:07,220
I'm going back to the body, yeah, yeah

1267
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,220
I don't know if you can take it more

1268
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,220
You can't believe it, yeah

1269
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:15,220
I'm dressed in, come and please me

1270
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:19,220
On the days you've got wings of their names ring

1271
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,220
Let me teach you

1272
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,220
You're my fantasy

1273
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:25,220
Think it's time for you to come

1274
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,220
Tell me, if you can take it more

1275
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:45,220
You're my fantasy

1276
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,220
Think it's time for you to come

1277
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,220
You're my fantasy

1278
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,220
Think it's time for you to come

1279
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,220
You're my fantasy

1280
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:01,220
Think it's time for you to come

1281
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,220
Think it's time for you to come

1282
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,220
Think it's time for you to come

1283
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,220
Think it's time for you to come

1284
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,220
Think it's time for you to come

1285
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:19,220
Think it's time for you to come

1286
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:23,220
I'm dressed in, come and please me

1287
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:27,220
On the days you've got wings of their names ring

1288
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,220
Let me teach you

1289
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,220
You're my fantasy

1290
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,220
Think it's time for you to come

1291
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,220
Think it's time for you to come

1292
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,220
Think it's time for you to come

1293
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:41,220
Think it's time for you to come

1294
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,220
Think it's time for you to come

1295
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,220
Think it's time for you to come

1296
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,220
Think it's time for you to come

1297
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,220
Think it's time for you to come

1298
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,220
Think it's time for you to come

1299
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,220
Think it's time for you to come

1300
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,220
Think it's time for you to come

1301
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:59,220
Think it's time for you to come

1302
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,220
Think that's time for you to come

1303
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,220
Think it's time for you to come

1304
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:08,700
a bunch of other shows that we're adding as we go along at nogendestream.com.

1305
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:19,220
We've got Divoracora, which's unplugged, and we've got that John C. Divorac, JCDJ, interludes,

1306
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:25,140
lots more stuff. For the first time, actually, I got an extra bandwidth bill about

1307
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:29,100
three weeks into the month that hasn't happened, because of course the stream is growing

1308
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:35,220
in popularity, so that's good news and bad news. Good news, because it's working bad news,

1309
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:41,460
it's cost a more money. By the way, it's so cool to use any of the nogend apps I drive

1310
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:47,340
wrong Los Angeles, and I've just got my iPhone. I just plug it right into the little holder

1311
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:52,500
on the dashboard, and the stream works great. I'm listening to it all the time. Christina was

1312
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,380
even in listening to the stream. She got the blackberry app, which is kind of a front end

1313
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,700
to the web browser, but at least it works. And, by the way, I've been moved into our

1314
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:05,380
priority app section on the blackberry, which is all cool, like that very much.

1315
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:11,380
Before I forget, if you're looking for information about John Cirl, it's CirlSolution.com.

1316
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:16,080
Again, CirlS Sierra Echo Alpha Romeo Lima, put a link to it in the show notes at dailySource

1317
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,900
code.com. So, way over the one hour mark, but of course, that is a snap food Saturday,

1318
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:25,700
edition of the Charlie. So, that's okay. If we go a little bit over. And, although I will

1319
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:33,580
miss her terribly, as she leaves on Monday, and it'll be sad not to have her around for

1320
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:39,100
the next two months. And I know she's coming back. That's great. I will say, I got to

1321
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:44,540
talk a little bit softer. So, 19 year old years don't hear me. The one thing I am looking

1322
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:55,060
for, too, is getting nasty again. Kind of can't do that when you're a kid in the next

1323
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:02,060
room, don't you? So, let this be the message.

1324
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:50,060
Let's get it all. We're all sensitive people. We're so much to you. I understand each other.

1325
01:18:50,060 --> 01:19:07,260
Once we got to be, let's live. I love them. I love them all. With me loving you,

1326
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:19,500
maybe not not. And, giving yourself to me, can never be wrong. If the love is true, I'll

1327
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:40,500
ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1328
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:55,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1329
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:05,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1330
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:15,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1331
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:20,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1332
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:30,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1333
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:40,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1334
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:53,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.

1335
01:20:53,500 --> 01:21:23,500
I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you. I'll ask you.
