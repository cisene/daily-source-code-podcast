She's sitting up.

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Hold on to the stand.

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Every time I touch her head.

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
She's like a burning in the fire.

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
She held it.

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Hold it too long.

92
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400

171
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,220
Oh.

172
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Oh.

173
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
I know about this school.

174
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
The little girl brought you along.

175
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
I can't be so old.

176
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,220
I think you know the girl in the room.

177
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,220
I think of the education that I've been.

178
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,220
But that my own work was never quite like this.

179
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Oh.

180
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,220
I've got the teacher.

181
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
I've got the pencil.

182
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,220
I've got the teacher.

183
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,220
I've got the teacher.

184
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
Oh.

185
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:42,220
Oh.

186
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Oh.

187
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Oh.

188
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Man.

189
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
I think the clock is slow.

190
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,220
It's good to speak.

191
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,220
I don't feel tired.

192
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
And it's.

193
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
It's.

194
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
It's.

195
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
The last I spent.

196
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
Oh.

197
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:08,220
I got to take it, got to take it, got to take it, I got to take it.

198
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
I'm not going to teach you all.

199
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,220
Back in the day when videos were so incredibly simple, all you had to do is have a lot of hair.

200
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,220
A lot of wiggly guitars was a hot ass Jackson video.

201
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
That's all it's done.

202
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,220
For a simple, we have to still have to do it.

203
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
We got it.

204
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
We got it.

205
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
We got it.

206
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Rock.

207
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,220
Diamond David Lee and Batman Hayland.

208
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,220
We're hot for teacher and baby source code.

209
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,220
The episode number is 844.

210
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
You are more than welcome.

211
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,220
As we singlehandedly bring back the art of radio.

212
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,220
You know, playing songs for people who give a crap.

213
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
Just let me get one more out of my system.

214
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
I got one more.

215
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
Got it.

216
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
I love these guys.

217
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:12,220
It's the cult.

218
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
Check this one.

219
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
There's a red roll.

220
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,220
It caught you the same.

221
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
I want my own.

222
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,220
She got me in fear.

223
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220

You're the same.

226
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
You do it on me.

227
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,220
You know what I mean for.

You're the same.

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
You do it on me.

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Yeah.

I'm what I'm million in trousers.

318
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
The end's always different.

319
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
I set it up.

320
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,260
No more beating my friends.

324
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,260
Where I need to start my guy.

Of course I had him in the earphone.

326
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,260

He's on the bottom of the stairs

418
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
He's gonna be your pranker

419
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
I let it through the shoulders, please

420
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Doctor said you're like a song

421
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
You were part of it in my head

422
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Doctor said you're like me

423
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I didn't mean to do such a real

424
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Doctor said you're like me

425
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
The only one they can't do

426
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,080
He said you are like me

427
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
You killed me

428
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Drunk the hole

429
00:24:42,080 --> 00:25:12,080

431
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Well, those of you new to the program, you should know by, well, you'll understand very quickly

432
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,080
that this program is produced by chuckleheads around the world.

433
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,780
Many of them do it in real time and we stream the show, which is usually on Friday, sometimes

434
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,080
on Saturdays and they're all in the chat room and no agenda chat.net and just saying,

435
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
hey we vote for this demolition demanded.

436
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,080
The demand is okay, that means we have to comply.

437
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Wouldn't want to get in trouble.

438
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Why are you all right?

439
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,080
She turned a 10-year-old baby.

440
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,080
She was taking the TV show.

441
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,080
She's sweet as any more.

442
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,080
And though she wanted me with her.

443
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,080
She landed me with a child.

444
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,080
Every night.

445
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Hey, what are you doing?

446
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
The science is in.

447
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,080
And I'm dancing faster.

448
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

449
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

451
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,980
I am the one who's running inside

452
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,980
She blinded me with silence

453
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Fading to her house

454
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,980
When she thousand next to me

455
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,980
I am the one who's running inside

456
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,980
I am the one who's running inside

457
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,980
I am the one who's running inside

458
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,980
I am the one who's running inside

459
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,980
Stokes

460
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
Fading to her house

461
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
She's back in love

462
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
I am the one who's running inside

463
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,980
I am the one who's running inside

464
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
She blinded me with silence

465
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,980
She blinded me with silence

466
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Fading to her house

467
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Fading to her house

468
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
She's back in love

469
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
She blinded me with silence

470
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
Fading into her house

471
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,980
She blinded me with silence

472
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,980
She blinded me with silence

473
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
She blinded etk

474
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Fading to her house

475
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:43,980
I guess the musical director for the Ted Comments is always hanging around Thomas Dolby.

476
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,980
She blinded me with science here on the Daily Source Code episode 844.

477
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Well, we're stuck in the 80s.

478
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,980
We might as well roll out some Doran Doran.

479
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Oh boy!

480
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:18,980
You're wild boys and calling, I may way back from the fire.

481
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:26,980
They're not good smooth, surrender to it, just cut on the rise.

482
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,980
What will it's more than far from glory?

483
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Breakfast and so on, good.

484
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,980
On the races that you smell,

485
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Because there's murder, murder, murder by the road.

486
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,980
Sight in a sore, afraid new world.

487
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,980
They start to break us.

488
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,980
Looks like they'll try again.

489
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,980
What will it be? Never lose it.

490
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,980
What will it be? Never chose this way.

491
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

492
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,980
What will it always?

493
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Sight in a sore, afraid new world.

494
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,980
You got sirens for a welcome.

495
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,980
There's bloodstained for your pain.

496
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:37,980
And your spell has fallen, bleeding while your dancing in the rain.

497
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,980
Why will it's more than far from glory?

498
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,980
Where is all you angels?

499
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Now the figure has something else.

500
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:57,980
And look us more with arrows over secrets they can tell.

501
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Please try to tell you,

502
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,980
It's like they're trying again.

503
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,980
What will it be? Never lose it.

504
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,980
What will it be? Never chose this way.

505
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

506
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,980
What will it always?

507
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

508
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

509
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

510
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

511
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

512
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,980
What'll it be? Never losing.

513
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,980
What will it be? Never chose this way.

514
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

515
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,980
What will it be? Never close your eyes.

516
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Never� be it.

517
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Why will it be? Never close your eyes.

518
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Never close your eyes.

519
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
What the hell did you get here?

520
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,980
Come on, come on.

521
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Come on.

522
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Come on.

523
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Come on.

524
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Come on.

525
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
Come on.

526
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Somehow we remember this is being cooler back in the day.

527
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
I was so involved with that.

528
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Wow.

529
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Actually it's my boy to get some women into the chat room.

530
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,980
The chicks all loved her and her.

531
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Actually, uh,

532
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
I'm a little bothered.

533
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
I have kind of a weird relationship.

534
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,980
There was like three live shows back in the day that I was hosting concerts.

535
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,980
And Duran Duran was slated to perform.

536
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,980
And every single time I was there with them,

537
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,980
Simon would be either so stoned or so drunk,

538
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,980
or both as drunk, I guess,

539
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
that that he would either walk off stage,

540
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
puke and halfway through,

541
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
or he wouldn't go on at all and the band.

542
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Everyone was hating everybody at the time.

543
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
I'll show up and before the concert,

544
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
and he'd be like, oh God,

545
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
not you again.

546
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,980
And I do just chill out, man.

547
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Just relax.

548
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
Whew.

549
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
Yeah, it's been quite a week.

550
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Very, very busy.

551
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,980
Got lots of stuff to talk about with y'all.

552
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
And of course,

553
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,980
I've received many tracks to play on today's Charlie.

554
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,980
And requests still coming in through our chat room.

555
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
Noah Jenna Chat.

556
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,980
And today is also a very special day.

557
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,980
We'll talk about that in a moment.

558
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,980
We've first got to take you back just a few years.

559
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,980
A few years in time.

560
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Thank you, Mr. Marcus Couch.

561
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,980
For sending this one along.

562
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Perfect for a footballer Friday.

563
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,980
Bad company.

564
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Can't get enough of your love,

565
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
and you know who you are.

566
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,980
We'll all take whatever I want.

567
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,980
And baby, I won't you wait.

568
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,980
You give me something I need.

569
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Now tell me I got something for you.

570
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

571
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
We'll do it.

572
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Come on, we'll do what you do.

I can't get enough of your love.

591

I can't get enough of your love.

592
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
I can't get enough of your love.

593
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
I can't get enough of your love.

594

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

600
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:45,980
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

601
00:37:45,980 --> 00:38:10,780
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah dried up so, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, original, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah and yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

602
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Oh man, they don't make music like that anymore, that's right, I'm old.

603
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Hey, it's my birthday next Friday, what a real footballer then.

604
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Can't get enough of my love, you're low.

605
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Back company, I'm the Charlie, Delta Sheriff Charlie, episode eight,

606
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
four, four footballer Friday edition.

607
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:56,980
It is August 27th, 2010, 20 years ago today, my daughter was born.

608
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:05,980
And, well, I got a bit of a story about that, but I want to hold back

609
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,980
because my good buddy Ray, you know, Ray on the Charlie, he also, of course,

610
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
sent in tracks for today's show.

611
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,980
He made a ray on the Charlie, it is episode 40 of Ray in the Charlie.

612
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,980
It's titled the Happy Daughter Birthday Edition.

613
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,980
And since I never listened to these beforehand, because I like being surprised,

614
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,980
just like the rest of y'all.

615
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,980
Let's see where it is, and then I'll come back and maybe play, maybe tell you the story.

616
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,980
Depending on what he has, he's usually pretty good with his history.

617
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
All we want is Ray. Hey, everybody!

618
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:50,980
So today it's August 27th and, of course, that's a very special day in the agenda of the family carries.

619
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Because Christina turned 20 today.

620
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,980
There are places, I'll remember, all my life.

621
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:11,980
Although some have changed, some forever, not for better.

622
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,980
Some have gone, and some remain.

623
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:23,980
All these places have their moments.

624
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:31,980
And lovers, friends, I still can recall.

625
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Some are dead, and some are living.

626
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,980
In my life, I love the humble.

627
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,980
So first of all, Adam, congratulations with your daughter.

628
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
Thank you.

629
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,980
I combine that with soundtrack to your life, I think.

630
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,980
I probably know what I'm going to play.

631
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,980
When you start off like Christina, you know, when she was born,

632
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,980
we had light at that time.

633
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,980
On in the Italy room, and as she was born during the Beatles in my life,

634
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
this soundtrack to my life.

635
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,980
There are places I remember, all my life.

636
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,980
Though some have changed, some forever, not for better.

637
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,980
Some have gone, and some remain.

638
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,980
All these places have their moments.

639
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,980
Well, lovers and friends, I still can recall.

640
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,980
Some are dead, and some are living.

641
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,980
In my life, I love them.

642
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:55,980
But of all these friends and lovers, there is no one.

643
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Converse with you, and these memories lose their meaning.

644
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:08,980
When I think of them as something you don't know.

645
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,980
I'll never lose affection, but people and things.

646
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:21,980
But when people, I know I'll always stop and think about them.

647
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,980
In my life, I love you more.

648
00:42:38,980 --> 00:43:07,980
All right, thank you, hit me deep here.

649
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,580
That's right, life, I love you, ma'am.

650
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:20,860
August 27th, 1990, Christina was born through C-section, the doctor, Dr. Louis Lodosi pulled

651
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,860
her out.

652
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,060
She was beautiful, she was perfect.

653
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:30,740
And in the delivery room at that moment on WLTW, Light FM New York Station, the Beatles

654
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,740
in my life was playing.

655
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,860
So whenever I hear that, obviously, I really transport back, so that is indeed totally

656
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,340
a soundtrack of my life tune.

657
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,820
And I had a feeling you were probably going to do that right.

658
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,900
I'm so nice that the keep track of all that stuff, man.

659
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,020
If I ever write a book, I'm not going to write it.

660
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,140
I'm just going to let you write it, and I'll just edit it.

661
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,380
It would be a lot better.

662
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,780
So Christina turned 20 today, which of course gives me reflection.

663
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
Nameless kid.

664
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
You know, that's weird.

665
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,420
It's really weird.

666
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,340
I don't feel older anything, but it's just like, wow, you know, she's launched.

667
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,340
She's off on her own.

668
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,940
She was feeling a little bit bummed out today, partially because, you know, no longer a

669
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,220
teenager yet, not officially legal.

670
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,180
It's 20 is kind of a weird age.

671
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,740
And I reflect back to where I was when I was 20.

672
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,340
Maybe you're thinking about that at this moment as well.

673
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,460
I will be really nice if you're listening to the show live.

674
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,060
It's a giver of tweet and a whisper.

675
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,060
We're a happy birthday.

676
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,780
It's still 15 minutes left to go and get Monation East where she currently resides,

677
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,100
although she will be coming to the United States in September.

678
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,300
Very, very happy about that.

679
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,540
She'll be coming to live here for a while and maybe for good, we'll see.

680
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:46,420
She's Chrissy at Chrissy Curry, CHRI SSIE, C-U-R-R-Y.

681
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,100
I never gave her that nickname.

682
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Nick names for her.

683
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,820
That might be kind of fun just to embarrass her.

684
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,300
Cupcake.

685
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
But head.

686
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,700
Don't we all call our kids but head at one point or another?

687
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,940
And shwarkin' which is kind of hard to explain but trust me.

688
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,500
That's the one that she will respond to immediately and she knows that I'm calling her.

689
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,820
And I do want to play a song for her.

690
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,580
And this one is from a couple years back.

691
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:24,460
This is actually a life performance in Los Angeles from 2008, John Mayer, really sums it

692
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,460
all up.

693
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,460
If you got a daughter, you'll feel it.

694
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:58,460
I know that you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you don't have a daughter but you

695
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:12,460
she goes to the color inside of my world she's just like a maze we're all over

696
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:38,460
I don't know I can't stand our steps with my heart and my hands now I'm starting to sing maybe it's got nothing at all to do with me

697
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:54,460
Father's beginning to your daughters daughters will live like you too

720
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,860
Back in a seven-day snack, don't blame

721
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,460
Thanks to Link and I got three

722
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,860
Blood on the surface, like it ain't no good in your hand

723
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,860
Whip, oh deep, players don't sense it

724
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,860
For you might get what we call a red crack

725
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,860
I don't slack when it comes to street

726
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,860
I can't really keep on doing games to beat you

727
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,860
It's so sweet, when you got money to spin

728
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,860
And I got a proper big tooth

729
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,860
And a floppy chance, I think it's been my throw

730
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,860
One more smoke, that's how it is, and that's how it goes

731
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,860
Like you know, when I treat this smoke

732
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,860
People love to the players that I know

733
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,860
When I was just a baby, my mama told me

734
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,860
She was always in the air, good boy

735
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,860
Don't ever pull me with guns

736
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,860
But I shot a man in Reno

737
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,860
Just to watch him last

738
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,860
I hear that it was full-blown

739
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,860
I think my hair is right

740
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,860
Don't drop on fools with a quick mix

741
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,860
I know you're for the sickness

742
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,860
I get grateful the way that I get

743
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,860
This kind of jista, and no jista

744
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,860
A good thing, I'll go play an A, E, C

745
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,860
And I live my life's great grace

746
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,860
And you don't need no one to spray

747
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,860
You've been in real poopies and you don't face me

748
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,860
I think too scared to back that release

749
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,860
Myself, you could put a man go on a record

750
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,860
So I go crack what I've done

751
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,860
It's like a straight-up piece

752
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,860
Before you do it, break it one hand

753
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,860
Look at this, and don't get lost

754
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,860
It's the number under, or you might wonder

755
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,860
What's up on the menu?

756
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
I gotta say this made a good thing

757
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,860
Teach out the way so I get rough to one

758
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,860
I was just a baby

759
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,860
My mama told me she was

760
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,860
Always be a good boy

761
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,860
Don't ever pull me with guns

762
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,860
But I shot a man in Reno

763
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,860
Just to watch him last

764
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,860
I hear that it was full-blown

765
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,860
I think my hair is right

766
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,860
Oh, you don't need to see that

767
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,860
I must hide it

768
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,860
It can't be at home, I straight up home

769
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,860
I leave from to the sound of a gang

770
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,860
The baby's watching him a record

771
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,860
But when on the computer screen

772
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,860
That old cheap beat, I am being low

773
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,860
Seeing and low, hip hop, thunder, so quick

774
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,860
To run just break, to the dirt, full of the work

775
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,860
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

776
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,860
That silence when it comes to beating

777
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,860
Because after so much, we get play an A, E, C

778
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,860
Women came play me, some say I'm crazy

779
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,860
What I go, think so, come and do a vocal

780
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,860
I get to tell about a standard trick

781
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,860
Let me hit him one time

782
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,860
The trick that's in, but don't trick

783
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,860
He's my don't knowful

784
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,860
That silence, I got no love for you

785
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,860
I was just a baby

786
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,860
My mama told me she was

787
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,860
Always be a good boy

788
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,860
Don't ever pull me with guns

789
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,860
But I shot a man in Reno

790
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,860
Just to watch him last

791
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,860
I hear that it was full-blown

792
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,860
I think my hair man

793
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,860
Right

794
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,860
Let me hit him one time

795
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,860
The trick that's in, but don't trick

796
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,860
I hit him one time

797
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,860
The trick that's in, but don't trick

798
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,860
I can't go with him, play me, some say

799
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,860
Boom, lazy work

800
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,860
One more, one more

801
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,860
We can't play it

802
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,860
He's like you wanna be the youngest

803
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,860
I'd like sure, I had picked that one up

804
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,860
I picked that one up, but I had it in my notes, maybe an email, I don't know.

805
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,860
It's kind of weird, it's like a Johnny Cash and easy-eat,

806
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:52,860
the Folsom Fursum Gangstas mashup by DJ Topcat.

807
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,860
Kind of thinking that.

808
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,860
A little drum and bass on the Charlie.

809
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,860
I've only had something to mix into it, I'll be just perfect wouldn't it?

810
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,860
I want to thank everybody for really supporting this program.

811
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:14,860
On the last week, I guess last week, on this Naftu Saturday, I asked you to support this program by supporting the big app show.

812
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,860
Now I think I'm actually going to be in trouble.

813
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,860
And here's what's going on.

814
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:25,860
I have this one ad, a Google Adsense Mobile ad in my app.

815
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,860
And everyone's happily clicking away, and that's great,

816
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:36,860
except if I look at the amount of ads to the click through rate ratio,

817
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,860
it's like some unbelievable number.

818
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:44,860
It's like 43% of all people who hit the about big apps tab.

819
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,860
If you haven't seen the big app show, it's an iPhone app, go ahead and download it from the app store.

820
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,860
It's a free.

821
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,860
I bring you an episode of a new app every single day.

822
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:05,860
So it's really working very well, but I have a slight concern that perhaps Google will think it's out of control.

823
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,860
And they may not even pay me.

824
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,860
I don't know, I'll have to see what happens at the end of the month.

825
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,860
They have this new thing where they go through reconciliation.

826
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,860
They give you these numbers in real time almost.

827
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,860
And I say, this is your estimated earnings.

828
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,860
And if it actually work like this, it'd be pretty good.

829
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:27,860
You know, I'm about a quarter of the way where I need to be considering all the work that goes into it.

830
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,860
But I also, the ads are just, they're not relevant to the people who are in the app.

831
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,860
That's the thing that bothers me the most is it's showing your web hosting ads.

832
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:42,860
And looking to move, looking to relocate, it doesn't make any sense.

833
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,860
The contextual nature of it just broken, just doesn't work.

834
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:54,860
So I'm thinking of asking you to find people who would be willing to be featured.

835
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:00,860
With an ad that actually, you know, when I say the people, hey, go take a look at this.

836
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:07,860
There's some kind of relevant product like maybe, oh, I don't know, something for the iPhone or something for your iPod.

837
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,860
You know, there's tons of products out there.

838
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,860
And I'll charge people the same that Google pays per click.

839
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,860
But then people actually see the ad and they don't make sense to them, you know.

840
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,860
So that would be a good way to help out this show.

841
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:30,860
Now, let me take you back in time.

842
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:36,860
To Miss Donna Summers, the ears of the disco queen and us.

843
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:54,860
She didn't hear eating at home.

844
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:59,860
I'm waiting for some love to come.

845
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,860
So I'm about a thousand months leaving.

846
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,860
I almost hang the phone off the wall.

847
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,860
Looking for some lights down free with this evening.

848
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,860
I miss a lot of stuff here at your desk.

849
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,860
I want some hot stuff here at this evening.

850

I need hot stuff.

856
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,860
Looking for a lover who needs a lover.

857
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:03,860
Don't want another night on my own.

858
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,860
Wanna share my love with a woman.

859
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,860
Wanna bring a woman back home.

860
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:15,860

891
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,860
Do you mind ladies?

892
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,860
Oh, yes, it's lady's night.

01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,860
Everything's gonna be alright

961
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,860
This is your make too late

962
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,860
Everything's gonna be alright

963
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,860
This is your make too late

964
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,860
Everything's gonna be alright

965
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,860
This is your make too late

966
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:34,860
Everything's gonna be alright

967
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,860
This is your make too late

968
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,860
Everything's gonna be alright

969
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,860
This is your make too late

970
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,860
I got a catastrophic failure here with the system

971
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:50,860
I got a freeze, so I might have to unbreak something

972
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,860
Ah, there we go, let's come back to life

973
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,860
Sorry about the poor mix

974
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,860
Kind of a little mac problem

975
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,860
Oh boy

976
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,860
At least we can keep the stream going

977
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:06,860
Please tell me this is your original Steve Jobs

978
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,860
Otherwise I will come to Cooper Tino and kick your ass

979
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:44,860
I got a freeze, so I might have to unbreak something

980
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:48,860
Ah, there we go, let's come back to life

981
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:54,860
I got a freeze, so I might have to unbreak something

982
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,860
Ah, there we go, let's come back to life

983
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:04,860
I got a freeze, so I might have to unbreak something

984
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,860
If you are sorry

985
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:10,860
I can't stop for that

986
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:16,860
Hugbing my body

987
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,860
You can pull my body

988
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,860
You can pull my body

989
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,860
I can pull my body

990
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,860
You can pull my body

991
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,860
Pull my body

992
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:37,860
You can be my bag

993
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,860
You can be my bag

994
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,860
Heart pockets

995
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,860
The night is young

996
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,860
And all of us are being the keys

997
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,860
But come on

998
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:57,860
And let your到底 sleep

999
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,860
My heart, how can you know

1000
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,860
I don't know

1001
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,860
So long I'll pass it

1002
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:10,860
And I'll make it for me

1003
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:16,860
You can be my bag

1004
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,860
You can be my bag

1005
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,860
Heart pockets

1006
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:24,860
The night is young

1007
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,860
And all of us are being the keys

1008
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,860
But come on

1009
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,860
And let your到底 sleep

1010
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,860
But come on

1011
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,860
And let your到底 sleep

1012
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:59,860
The heart's talking to me

1013
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:07,860
The heart's talking to me

1014
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:14,860
The heart's talking to me

1015
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:25,860

01:13:50,860 --> 01:14:00,860
The heart's talking to me

1020
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:09,860

The heart's talking to me

1024
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:55,860
You can take that to the bank

01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:30,860
The heart's talking to me

1026
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:41,860
The heart's talking to me

The heart's talking to me

1054
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,860
The heart's talking to me

1055
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:58,200
We'll do that!

1056
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:10,580
All in it y'all say

1057
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:40,580
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come

1058
01:20:40,580 --> 01:21:10,580
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

1059
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:40,580
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, coming on, so, go on, oh, hey, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, one on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

1060
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:43,580
I think I'm about like 10 songs left or so.

1061
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,080
I think I'll probably get through most of them before I have to shut down and get this show uploaded.

1062
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:51,580
So the rest of the universe can enjoy the sounds of the bar.

1063
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,580
Hit him from the right.

1064
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,580
Hang it outside that dirty laundry.

1065
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:05,580
Don Henley on the Charlie.

1066
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,580
I live my living, I'll be even news.

1067
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,580
Just give me something.

1068
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,580
Something I can use.

1069
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,580
People love it when you lose.

1070
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,580
They love getting away.

1071
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,580
Well, I could have been an actor, but I won't love you.

1072
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:39,580
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear.

1073
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:45,580
Kind of playing like it, give me what I'm expected.

1074
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:53,580
Get him lift him up, get him with him down.

1075
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:04,580
Get him lift him down, get him with him.

1076
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,580
The bubble headed bridge-plan comes on and on

1077
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:19,580
She can tell you about the plane crack with a gleam in her head

1078
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,580
It's interesting when you keep your dad

1079
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,580
You must dare and love me

1080
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:33,580
When we fill the ablation, it's the head gate

1081
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:38,580
You know the boys in the newsroom, got a running back

1082
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:45,580
Get the winner on the set, we get it all ready

1083
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:18,580
You don't even need to find out what's going on

1084
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:23,580
You don't even want to know just how far it's gone

1085
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:27,580
Just leave what's going on

1086
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:31,580
You don't even need to find out what's going on

1087
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:36,580
You don't even want to know just how far it's gone

1088
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:39,580
Just leave what's going on

1089
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,580
You don't even need to find out what's going on

1090
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,580
Get the winner on

1091
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,580
Get the winner on

1092
01:24:52,580 --> 01:25:01,580
Get the winner on

1093
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:31,580
All right, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

1094
01:25:31,580 --> 01:26:01,580
We can bring in you when we know we can nail us insane, when we said it now we haven't told you yet, we are all in the craft, this king, give us their love yet,

1095
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:12,900
let's go, let's go, ! pop!

1096
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:29,820
Just got an email for my real my sister real old man, really, apparently he musta

1097
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:33,260
She got her first iPhone app in the app store.

1098
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,820
Oh my god, that's awesome.

1099
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,420
I can't wait to load it up.

1100
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,220
Unfortunately, of course, I already did the app.

1101
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,460
So it's for most of this week.

1102
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:45,540
So I'll be sure to promote her.

1103
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,700
And the next run of the app is so good.

1104
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:52,900
I really have a lot of fun doing that, by the way.

1105
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:56,180
Totally, just great.

1106
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,500
So many amazing apps.

1107
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,700
And I actually wind up using a lot of them.

1108
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:06,340
Also, PC near 37 is working with me and looks like we're going to be doing an Android

1109
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,340
version of the app.

1110
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:11,420
If we can get most of the bits and pieces together, they're so I'm very excited about that.

1111
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:15,020
And I want to point out Mr. Oil just left to go to sleep, although he's listening

1112
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:16,020
to the stream.

1113
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,740
There's a new initiative for the No Agenda fans out there.

1114
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:24,180
It's called No Agenda Records, No Agenda Records.com and the first, hey, we've dropped

1115
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,180
something.

1116
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,180
That's right.

1117
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,180
