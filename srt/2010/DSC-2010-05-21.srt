Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

160
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

161
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

162
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

163
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

164
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

165
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

166
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

167
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

168
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

169
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

170
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

171
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Then the black clothes, more of Chris Robinson, the lead singer, so skinny, he passed away over three years ago

172
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm hoping Jeff puts it up for sale, I think that's what he should do with it

173
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,100
I think he should put it on iTunes and make everybody go buy it

174
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Because the guy's done so much for the Noah gender show

175
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,100
He laid this on me, and it's kind of a precursor to an album I think he's working on

176
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Jeff's a guy who's been around podcasting for a number of years

177
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,100
He's done a whole bunch of jingles for this show

178
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
It really builds a little cottage industry out of it

179
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,100
But also it's had a tough time recently with his piano bar in Nashville

180
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Mainly because of the flooding, so business is down

181
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
So when this comes out, I want you all to go and buy it

182
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,100
When his album comes out, you definitely have to go buy that

183
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,100
But when you hear this song, particularly if you are a fan of the show that takes place in the morning

184
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
You're going to trip out

185
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,100
It is the in the morning song, Jeff Smith on the Charlie

186
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100

Jeff Smith on the Charlie

207
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

208
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

209
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

210
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100

211

Jeff Smith on the Charlie

213
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

214
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Jeff Smith on the Channel

215
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

216
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

217
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

218
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Jeff Smith on the Charlie

219
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,760
From up on the hilltop

220
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,940
As the world occurs past bad

221
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,860
It's time

222
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,340
Same old history

223
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,940
Switching off the TV

224
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,400
Soon in and out watching the sky

225
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,440
It's a little bit cracked

226
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,240
But I didn't must kill it

227
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,640
Did you ride a kill in the mouth?

228
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I've been doing how, here in the morning

229
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm all doing how, here in the morning

230
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,680
It's nothing that old it is here in the morning

231
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,680
It's time to kill the morning

232
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,680
It's time to do it now, here in the morning

233
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,680
I want to do it now, here in the morning

234
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,680
It's nothing that old it is here in the morning

235
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,680
It's time to do it now, here in the morning

236
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:33,680
It's time to do it now, here in the morning

237
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,680
I want to do it now, here in the morning

238
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
It's nothing that old it is here in the morning

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,680
It's time to do it now, here in the morning

240
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
It's nothing too old

241
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,360
It's not here, not here

242
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
I can't tell if you're British or English бounds

243
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,940
I sure just met on the Charlie brand new

244
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,240
The Bean S alguns with her Noah alive in the morning

245
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,180
I, Jeff, I love your math

246
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,080
I really, really do

247
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,240
A Kit's ass

248
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,480
How many guys for give you your theme song is a gift?

249
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,560
Not many

250
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,960
This is Daily Source Code A 3-3

251
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,060
This is for survive edition with funky인 Copmt Duna

252
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,060
Oh, cool and add a ball, and I'm looking for some action

253
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,060
But like Big Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction

254
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,060
The girls are all around

255
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
But none of them want to get with me

256
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
But they're at depression, I'm looking deaf

257
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
Yo, what's up, what have you all seen

258
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
The girl who's all jacking

259
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
At the other end, get a ball

260
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,060
Have a trick with some no name, just want to know that I'm a star

261
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,060
Someone got up the stove, dove

262
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,060
To the other side of the cantina

263
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
I asked the guy, why are you so fly?

264
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,060
He's never funky, comb it'd be enough

265
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
This brother told me a secret

266
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
On how to get more chicks

267
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,060
Put a little Medina here, your glass

268
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,060
And the girls are all real quick

269
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,060
It's better than any alcohol

270
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Or have a dcac

271
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,060
A couple of sips with this love, both of it

272
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Still long, long, long

273
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,060
So I gave some to my dog

274
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
When he began to beg

275
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
And then he looked his bowl

276
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
And he looked at me into the wild thing

277
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
Oh, my leg it

278
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
He scratched it bite me

279
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Before he was much, much meaner

280
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
But now all the food is run

281
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,060
They're my house for the funky, comb it'd be enough

282
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
You know what I'm saying

283
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
I got a little big dog and my neighborhood

284
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
A break of them, I'm a dog

285
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
I got spurs with his feet

286
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,060
And Alex from his clothes

287
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,060
He won't leave my dog alone with that Medina girl

288
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,060
I wouldn't have to do this girl

289
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
He said, hi, my name is Sina

290
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
I thought she would be good to go

291
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
Or the little funky, old Medina

292
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
He said, I'd like a drink, I'll set a home

293
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Okay, I'll go get it

294
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
And then a couple of sips with this girl

295
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Listen to who they see with me

296
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
So I took my crib

297
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
And everything went well as planned

298
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
I thought she got a dress with a big old man

299
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Sina was a man

300
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
So I threw a mouth, I don't throw the wrap

301
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
When the Oscar mile went up

302
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
You must be sure that's the girl

303
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,060
It's pure for the funky, combed Medina

304
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
You know

305
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,060
You know

306
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
You know plans with a man

307
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
There's the 80s and I'll go with the lady

308
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm a man

309
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
Break it down

310
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,060
You got a subwoofer

311
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,060
Now's the time to turn it up

312
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm a man

313
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm a man

314
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
I'm a man

315
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Break it down

316
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,060
Look for a little affection

317
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,060
I took a shot, I took a test

318
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,060
You know, I'm the love

319
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Be all you guess, boldest

320
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
And you know, they picked a winner

321
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
I took my date to the opening for Medina

322
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
I asked them dinner

323
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,060
She had a food drink, something and so on

324
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
What I'll be getting

325
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,060
She said she started talking about plans for a wedding

326
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Still waiting, I love not so fast

327
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
The healthy Sina

328
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
That's why I fell, you don't play around

329
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
What the funky, combed Medina

330
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
You know what I was saying

331
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
Yeah Medina's a monster girl

332
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
The date is a masterpiece

333
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
I don't know Medina

334
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
The part of the airways is landed, and he's sounding good to me

335
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
This is the daily source cut

336
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
With Adam Curry

337
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:20,060
Oh yeah, you thought Tonlo was interested in the choice

338
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
I don't know

339
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Remember the video for this one?

340
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Flying up in the helicopter

341
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,060
Two problems with a baby

342
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
I think there was number one for weeks

343
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Couldn't get it off the charts in the 80s

344
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Eat the lover

345
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,060
Eat the lover

346
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
ese lover

347
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
You'll get ahold on you

348
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Believe in

349
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,060
Nigh your love

350
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,060
Before you know it, you'll beON YOUR MEAST

351
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
She's an easy lover

352
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,060
You'll take your heart that you won't be in

353
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,260
She's not the one

354
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,020
I know I love her, and I'm just trying to make you see

355
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,020
She's the kind of girl you dream of

356
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,060
Dream of keeping hold up

357
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,660
Better forget it

358
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,660
You'll never get it

359
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,900
You'll wear your mask and leave you

360
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,940
Leave you when it's safe you

361
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,540
Better forget it

362
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,940
Oh, you'll regret it

363
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
No, you'll never change it

364
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,340
So leave it, leave it

365
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,740
Get up, quick, cross the end

366
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,340
Leave it, you'll only wear it

367
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,740
You'll never know

368
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,180
She's the kind of girl you dream of

369
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,540
You'll get a hold on you, believe it

370
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,900
Like no other before you know it

371
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,500
You'll be on your knees

372
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,980
She's the kind of girl you dream of

373
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,940
She'll take your heart, but you won't be there

374
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,580
She's like no other

375
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,420
And I'm just trying to make you see

376
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,180
She's the kind of girl you dream of

377
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,420
You'll never change it

378
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,420
You'll never get it

379
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,420
You'll never get it

380
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,220
She's the kind of girl you dream of

381
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,620
She's the kind of girl you dream of

382
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,420
Oh, you'll regret it

383
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,420
I know it's trying to change it

384
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,820
Just leave it, leave it

385
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,060
You'll not be only one and see it

386
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Then leave it, don't you only wear it

387
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,220
You'll never know

388
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,620
You'll never get it

389
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
You'll never get it

390
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,620
You'll never get it

391
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,620
You'll never get it

392
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,620
You'll never know

393
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,620
She's the kind of girl you dream of

394
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,620
You'll never be there

395
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
She's like no other

396
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,620
She's the kind of girl you dream of

397
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,620
She's the kind of girl you dream of

398
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,620
She's the kind of girl you dream of

399
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
She's like no other

400
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,620
And I'm just trying to make you see

401
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:44,620
She's the kind of girl you dream of

402
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,620
And I'm just trying to get it

403
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,620
She's the kind of kind of girl you dreamed

404
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,620
And I'm just trying to put

405
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:12,640
The last time I had the

406
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,840
You're your two heads taller and you've got hair. I hate you along there with the filibalee easy lover filibalee

407
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,800
Of course from earth when in fire another awesome awesome performer

408
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,640
Oh, it's a little note to self. I got to play reasons from earth when in fire

409
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,960
You know where all of a sudden he's like oh filibalee he's things so beautiful don't you agree. Oh, yes

410
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,400
Hey, wow, it's been quite a week for me. I spent the first three days in San Francisco

411
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,760
which is always

412
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
It's great to be

413
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,200
In the office with the the guys and gals although it's

414
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,640
Relatively tough to keep the no agenda show prep going

415
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,400
Of course, I'm leaving my laptop at home these days. I'm going 100% iPad and it's really working out

416
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,480
Although

417
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,360
little interesting experience I had I finally released my iPhone app called the big app show and

418
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,280
I highly appreciate not only all the promotion that everyone's done by retweeting and

419
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Pointing pointing the show out to people

420
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,160
But also the trouble shooting as it seemed that we had some encoding issues and it therefore broke on older generation iPhones and

421
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
And iPod touches

422
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,320
And so here's you can only imagine in my hotel room

423
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:31,360
The thing is out. It's propagating through the the iTunes app stores worldwide and I'm getting like 15% of people saying hey man this thing don't work

424
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,880
Like what what after all after a month of rejection from the apple police

425
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
This is impossible

426
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
So

427
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,320
Once I once my buddy Rob Corver in the Netherlands figured out what it was

428
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,600
He he said well you got to re-encode the clips this way and by the way

429
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm still working on a new encoding compression settings and schemes and Nick Mac at the office has helped me out with that

430
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,240
Because I think we can get it even better, but of course the videos have to work over Wi-Fi and 3G

431
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,360
Otherwise you have to label your app as a Wi-Fi only and I really didn't want to do that and

432
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
So I wound up

433
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,760
Accessing my laptop through the iPad

434
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
Through log me in

435
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,240
Log me in dot com is where you can it's kind of like a VNC type thing and they have an app for the iPad

436
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,240
It was not the easiest

437
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,080
Setting up compression settings and and compressing them all with the iPad, but it did work

438
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,800
Proving that even in a dire emergency

439
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,760
I still don't actually need a laptop in my possession when I'm on the road

440
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
So I'm very very excited about

441
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,720
About the feedback I think everyone now understands what I've been trying to accomplish with with the app

442
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,880
I did it right up at curry dot com if you want to see if you want to take a look at that

443
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,000
Actually I'll put a link in the show notes for that a daily source code dot com

444
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
I think that you know why I think I basically said it in my am I blog post

445
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,440
There's a hole in the whole discovery mechanism of apps that is big enough to drive a Mac truck through

446
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
And no one is able to really do

447
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,440
Screencast properly to demo their stuff and you know it takes a dumb guy like me who thinks very simply

448
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,840
To come up on the way to do that and just the response has been great and for the apps are featured

449
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,920
People like whoa wait a minute. What is this someone featured my app and it's working

450
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,560
It's helping people get more distribution for their apps which is exactly

451
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,080
Kind of what you do in radio so it makes so much sense to me and right after the show after I

452
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Do my three by three workout, which I'm still on the program by the way

453
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,920
Room for three months for the three some has promised and I will collect in there will be cameras

454
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,920
Then I'm gonna cut a couple more shows so suggestions are always welcome

455
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,600
The thing I really want to do is show some really cool games, but I am such a non-gamer that I have no idea

456
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,000
What to show so if you got any cool ideas for

457
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Games on the iPhone that I can show off in the next big app show I would love to hear from you

458
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,120
Drop me an email at a Maccurry dot com or add them at levio dot com

459
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Parties we get ready for the weekend

460
00:31:44,480 --> 00:32:14,480
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

464
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Oh, they, they sing, they play in our song

465
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Rocks are gonna have a freemame workout

466
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
But you're gonna leave me fish with most of them

467
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Take a man, take a fight!

468
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to be thinking about?

469
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to be thinking about?

470
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to be thinking about?

471
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to be thinking about?

472
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to be thinking about?

473
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to think about?

474
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Freddy, do you know what you're thinking about?

475
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Freddy, do you know what you mean about?

476
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Freddy, will you stay with me for a while?

477
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Freddy, do you know what you're thinking about?

478
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Freddy, do you know what you need to be thinking about?

479
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Freddy, watch out for two?

480
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Freddy, Are you kidding me?

481
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Freddy, do you know what you think about?

482
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Freddy, Do you know what you need to think about?

483
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
Freddy, do you know what you need to think about?

484
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Freddy, I know what you need to think about.

485
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Freddy, Do you know what you need to think about?

486
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,960
It's like a roll, who'd you go off a try to eat three, three,

487
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,120
and put my pride in.

488
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,760
It's not through the winter first, so go away.

489
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,480
It was a night at the old town hall.

490
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,160
It was a good mother-child because they were waiting to death.

491
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
It's not through the winter first.

492
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,320
It's two years of old r69.

493
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,200
It's not through the winter nights.

494
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,680
I've been lighter, dear to all my life.

495
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,780
With love, love My love, love, love,

496
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,120
Love, love, they keep up the ring.

497
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,840
I've been a future, dear to you.

498
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,640
I ain't lost a breath, everything ain't pasted.

499
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:43,160
We've fallen in the grass and closed behind the bar

500
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,160
And I hear it's got to bring you like a fire alarm

501
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:58,160
And I hear it's got to bring you like a fire alarm

502
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,160
And I hear it's got to bring you like a fire alarm

503
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I'm just a little drunk on out, it's crazy

504
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,160
There's someone who's saying, you are like a...

505
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

506
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,160
She wrote that act, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

507
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

508
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Oh, oh, oh

509
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

510
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Oh, oh

511
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

512
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,160
I won't know what I'm talking about

513
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,160
When you're nothing really knocks me out

514
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I'll get higher the time of your all-out to you

515
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,160
The most we're going to do is to you

516
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Rock heroes who take you out

517
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,660
Rock heroes who take you out

518
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,160
When you're nothing like you

519
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
It's been these measures

520
00:37:44,160 --> 00:38:02,160
This is what's just about the point where I want to be cruising down Ventura Highway.

521
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:11,160
In a convertible with this song, jamming out Rick Derring to rock and roll, who's secured off the Charlie 833 football Friday edition.

522
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,160
As you know, a lot of the show was built up and produced from the people who listen to it.

523
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,160
If you are listening to this on the podcast, we usually do the football Friday live.

524
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Some are around noon, get my nation westtime on Fridays, and I'm so sorry I haven't had time to do any other shows.

525
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:39,160
But on the other hand, I really love just grabbing a whole bunch of songs from iTunes, throw them in, throw them in, throw them in, throw them in, throw them in,

526
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,160
throw them in, oh, I'm stuck. And just jamming out with a whole bunch of buddies in the chat room. Hey, where's Bobby eating by the way?

527
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,160
I mean, today's the exact other day where I feel like we need a porn star to join us.

528
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Anyway, so we've got some comic strip blogger coming up.

529
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
I'm sure he'll give us an interesting take on the European Union.

530
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,160
And right now, before it takes off on a two week holiday, it is Ray on the Charlie.

531
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:19,160
It's been a very busy week, but I'm finally facing two weeks off.

532
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:28,160
So, my vacation is starting with a beautiful sunny Pentecostal weekend, and I really could use a song that fits perfectly with this mood.

533
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
The soundtrack to my life.

534
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,160
First of all, I'm totally awake and I am not afraid.

535
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,160
This week, the Netherlands got a serious warning from El Qaeda.

536
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Within two weeks, the world championship soccer will be played in South Africa.

537
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:52,160
And to hit up the event, the Iraqi government has released a video of a suspected Islamic extremist of El Qaeda.

538
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,160
The man claimed, during his arrest, that there are plans for attacks on the world cup.

539
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,160
On the same day, the Dutch National soccer team went to a training camp in Austria.

540
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,160
There was a serious warning of possible terrorist actions.

541
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:14,160
El Qaeda fighter El Qaeda would have considered to commit an attack on the Dutch National team and their fans.

542
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,160
The guy has been detained in Iraq.

543
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,160
He also gets such a weird feeling, are they messing with our fear again?

544
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,160
No way, man, we are going to kick some ass over there.

545
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
I mean, we got a rough elephant apart.

546
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,160
This leads to the Ryan Babel in Clash and Undal Arts.

547
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,160
All big, international soccer players.

548
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
We are not afraid of anything.

549
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:44,160
But first, we got to deal next week with the Euroficient Songcome past, and the Norwegian capital has long.

550
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
I mean, talking about big names, aren't?

551
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,160
The Netherlands is going to send sneak up a lovely Dutch girl.

552
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,160
You all probably understand for this song, at least we need a typical Dutch sound.

553
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Something like a Herry Gurdie.

554
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,160
And then we add a little bit of brain control.

555
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,160
I mean, this refrain man really got snuggled in your head.

556
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,160
So I'm going to play just a little fragment.

557
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
It's still in this fragment.

558
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:21,160
This is so embarrassing.

559
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
This is so embarrassing.

560
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,160
This is so embarrassing.

561
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
This is so embarrassing.

562
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,160
This is so embarrassing.

563
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,160
I mean, we can't be sending anything like this.

564
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,160
We've got some better artists in the Netherlands.

565
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Brexit.

566
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Just a beat up tempo song with a international sound and a rough, tough rock chain.

567
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Let me tell me how to get to Jerusalem because I have kind of lost my way.

568
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:58,160
So will you help me get the rat class as I can tomorrow might be too late.

569
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
I know I'm not sure.

570
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I haven't changed it to myself.

571
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I have.

572
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,160
You all think I know I'm a show.

573
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,160
I need some artists because they're me out as hell.

574
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Just a smile.

575
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,160
You have me for what I've been to the Netherlands.

576
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh well, we're going to keep Belgium 10 boys.

577
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
And then they give the same points back.

578
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Actually, it's just one.

579
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
It's something each other's boss contest.

580
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Why am I even bothering you with this stuff?

581
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
That really.

582
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
So I have them.

583
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Congratulations, which you're first iPhone app.

584
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Well done.

585
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
Thank you.

586
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
I don't have an iPhone, so I can't follow your new creative artwork.

587
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,160
But I'm certain you're going to be the man again.

588
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,160
So to wrap it up, two weeks ago, there was a request at the no agenda chat about

589
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,160
a new soundtrack to your life episodes.

590
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Right.

591
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,160
So let's combine that with a perfect song to kick off a sunny weekend in Kitmo Nation

592
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Lowlands.

593
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,160
And it's a song you like at him because of the great memories on a time when 45s were just

594
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,160
the day's version of ads.

595
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Oh, he's been new all the time.

596
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:22,160
He's from 24 years ago when it was a beautiful sunny spring in the Netherlands.

597
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
In 1986, there were the brothers.

598
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
What a full belief.

599
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Thank you for the morning.

600
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
My fellow technical head.

601
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,160
She came from somewhere back in a long ago.

602
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,160
She said, remember, fool comes.

603
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,160
She tried hard to recreate and forget yet to recreate.

604
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
That's in her life.

605
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,160
She missed us all smart.

606
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,160
For his nostalgia table.

607
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Never come in there but you wanted to save.

608
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Only to realize.

609
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,160
It never really was.

610
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:08,160
You see, we had a place in his life.

611
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,160
He had a man half the dice.

612
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,160
As he rises to her apology.

613
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,160
Everybody else puts you in the dark.

614
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,160
He's got you right going.

615
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:36,160
But he can't see.

616
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,160
The wise man has to go back.

617
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,160
To be the way.

618
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,160
I see.

619
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,160
To be.

620
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Just by the way.

621
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Nothing at all.

622
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,160
Keep shining in the sun.

623
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Why don't you give me a lot of gold?

624
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Where he can still believe there's a place in life.

625
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Someday, someday.

626
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,160
She will return.

627
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:26,160
She had a place in his life.

628
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:33,160
He loved her man half the dice.

629
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,160
As he rises to her apology.

630
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,160
Everybody else puts you in the dark.

631
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,160
He's got you right going.

632
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,160
But he can't see.

633
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,160
To be the way.

634
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:16,160
To be the way.

635
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
All right, Ray.

636
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,160
You totally made up for that Eurovision track you played.

637
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,160
The chair went wild.

638
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,160
My ears are bleeding out of my rectum.

639
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,160
As a Eurovision song cast contest.

640
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,160
So focused yet.

641
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,160
You can't not help watching.

642
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,160
I used to love watching it on the BBC.

643
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,160
He would always have the most sarcastic commentary.

644
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,160
But he stopped doing it.

645
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Someone in Brussels got all pissed off and were angry.

646
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Actually, we're on the topic of Europe.

647
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,160
We might as well welcome our old friend back for a moment here.

648
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:17,160
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip.

649
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Hello, I have a personal agenda.

650
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:41,160
You know, John and I got a kick out of you saying that every single time.

651
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,160
But you also had a digital agenda.

652
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,160
It's a five year plan when all your citizens should have brought plans by 2013 and later,

653
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,160
even with about 100 megabits per second.

654
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,160
Yeah, I was reading about this.

655
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
There was two stories that came in about the European Union.

656
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,160
But in owners of the United States of Europe, one is they want to harmonize all women's

657
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,160
dress sizes, which I find highly entertaining.

658
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,160
And the other one is that everyone should have broadband approved by your government, of course.

659
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,160
Well, we all know what that's good for.

660
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,160
So you see Adam, that you stands for faster pawn down.

661
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,160
So you must be good.

662
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
Right, yeah.

663
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Yo.

664
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,160
Yo.

665
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,160
I'm in my pain with this thing.

666
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Thank you, CSB.

667
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
I can stop driving 120 now.

668
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
Killing me softly with this song.

669
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
Killing me softly.

670
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
Slow down.

671
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,160
And get into the room.

672
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,160
I say set the crews that are about.

673
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,160
It was 73.

674
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,160
It's one of the jam kicks in on the food cheese.

675
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,160
It really is nice.

676
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,160
With his song.

677
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Yeah.

678
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:10,160
This is my cleft reference.

679
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,160
It's where I think about this little face in the head.

680
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,160
Why am I on this road, hang on my girl now?

681
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
One time, one time.

682
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,160
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

683
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,160
You got the lyrics.

684
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,160
I heard he sang her good song.

685
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,160
I heard he had a style

686
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,160
And so I came to see him

687
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:46,160
And it seemed for a while

688
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,160
And there he was this young one

689
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,160
Straying to do my ass

690
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,160
From in my pain with his finger

691
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:06,160
Singing my life with his words

692
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,160
Feeling me softly with this song

693
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,160
Feeling me softly with this song

694
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Telling my heart with his words

695
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:34,160
Feeling me softly with this song

696
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,160
I fell off lost with fever

697
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,160
It never stopped around

698
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,160
I felt he found my letter

699
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,160
He's what I know

700
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,160
I pray that he's worth happiness

701
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,160
But he just kept riding a horse

702
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,160
From in my pain with his finger

703
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,160
Singing my life with his words

704
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,160
Feeling me softly with his song

705
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,160
Feeling me softly with his song

706
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:28,160
Telling my heart with his words

707
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:37,160
Feeling me softly with his song

708
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,160
Feeling me softly with this song

709
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,160
Feeling me softly with this song

710
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,160
Feeling me softly with this song

711
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,160
Feeling me softly with this song

712
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Feeling me softly with this song

713
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Feeling me softly with this song

714
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Telling my heart with his words

715
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:51,160
Feeling me softly with this song

716
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:57,160
Feeling me softly with his song

717
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,160
Feeling me softly myś

718
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:11,160
Feeling me softly with his song

719
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,160
Feeling me softly with his song

720
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
Feeling me softly with his song

721
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,160
Feeling me softly with his song

722
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Feel me softly with his song

723
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,520
Because of course the language of music is so universal.

724
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:34,320
We lost a great one, I think it was Friday or Saturday, I found out that Ronnie James

725
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Deo had passed.

726
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:41,880
Now I had just seen him at the Golden Gods Awards in Los Angeles a couple weeks ago.

727
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:48,480
And of course, I didn't really have a personal relationship with Ronnie, but you know,

728
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,000
I interviewed him a couple times and had bangers ball and I think I've been to a

729
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
one or two show.

730
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,200
Maybe one show.

731
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,000
And it's really, really sad, I mean, the first thing I thought was like, I got a call

732
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Rudy.

733
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,440
Rudy Sarzo, not my buddy, he was playing bass for Deo.

734
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,040
And he was a distraught man, it was unbelievable, he was just like, yes, it's so messed up

735
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,640
because he had just gone through six weeks of intense, really intense chemo and radiation,

736
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:25,000
which is just completely F. And he didn't make it, which, you know, he had a tour plan,

737
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,600
they had a new album plan, he had just set up a new record company, he was, you know,

738
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,480
and there's a lot of infrastructure and a lot of people around the guy like Ronnie James

739
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:41,920
Deo, crew, band members, you know, office people and it's just, it's really, it's so,

740
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
so sad.

741
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,920
That's all it is.

742
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,600
And he's really sad.

743
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:52,880
And musically, he will be incredibly missed, but it'll always be Ronnie James Deo,

744
00:54:52,880 --> 00:55:12,080
our rainbow in the dark.

745
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:21,880
When there's a lightning, you know it always brings me down, call to free and I'll

746
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:31,880
see that it's me, it was the last thing you've ever found, I cry for you, I've been

747
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:47,520
dancing in the night, it was cold, lost my head to the sky over the night, no sign of the

748
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:58,520
morning party, you've been left on your own, like a rainbow in the dark, a rainbow in the

749
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,520
dark.

750
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:13,720
Do your demons, do they have a lot to go, when you're trying to be hiding inside, is it so

751
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:27,920
fun that you know, you're just a picture, you're in the image constantly, we were late,

752
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:38,160
you were going, you were lost without a rise, there's no sign of the morning party,

753
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:53,160
you've been left on your own, like a rainbow in the dark, just a rainbow in the dark, yeah,

754
00:56:53,160 --> 00:57:23,160
I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I

755
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:46,920
cry for you, I cry for you, I cry, cry for you, I cry for you, I cry for you, I cry, I cry with you, I cry for you, I cry for you, go away, now, let me be back my heart that takes me to believing in you,

756
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,420
Call it free, and I see that the street

757
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,920
Who's in the house, who's in the door

758
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Who's in the magic

759
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,920
I feel it proud to be here

760
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,920
But it's here, and you're here

761
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,920
Calling you away, stuck out

762
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Just the cycle of learning for me

763
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,920
There's no sign of the day

764
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Lupin, let's know you're home

765
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,920
You're a rainbow

766
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,920
You're a rainbow in the dark

767
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Yeah, yeah

768
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,920
You're a rainbow in the dark

769
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Just the rainbow in the dark

770
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,920
You'll sign of the night

771
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,920
Rest in peace, Ronnie James Dio

772
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,920
Rainbow in the dark

773
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Oh man, I will miss that guy

774
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,920
That's the crap that happens when you get older

775
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,920
You see all these people who you've been working with

776
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,920
And have hung out with and have loved their art

777
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,920
Just slowly fading away

778
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,920
Screw that man

779
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Hey, happy anniversary, just a transition for a second

780
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,920
Happy anniversary Marcus Couch

781
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Five years of the scene scene

782
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,920
I was just cruising through my email

783
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,920
Saw that he sent in a couple of tracks

784
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Recommendations for the footballer Friday

785
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Well, sight unseen as usual

786
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,920
Because you can always trust Marcus Couch

787
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,920
To come up with a good

788
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
K9, that's when I fuck things up again

789
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

790
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

791
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,920
The only happy well after this is not so easy

792
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,920
I should be your only sad

793
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,920
When I'm in the middle of the street

794
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,920
Only everything that makes me trust your hands

795
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,920
I know everything you do

796
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,920
That's when I fuck things up again

797
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,920
That's when I'm in the middle of the street

798
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

799
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

800
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,920
That's when I fuck things up again

801
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:46,920
Happy anniversary Marcus Couch

Five years of the scene scene scene scene

803
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

804
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

805
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

806
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

807
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,920
That's when I fuck things up again

808
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:18,920
That's when I'm in the middle of the street

809
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,920
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool

810
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,920
I'm a fool, I'm not a fool

811
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:48,920
sapphire, that's when I'm in the middle of the street

812
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,840
I know it's the thing's all

813
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,980
It's just that you think it's the last round

814
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,320
What things are the chance?

815
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,700
Oh, I'm Marcus, you didn't have to disappoint

816
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,500
Yes, you did

817
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,000
Yes, you did

818
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,500
Yes

819
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,180
Kage 9, that's when I fucked things up again

820
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,200
Completely right on target for the full bar Friday

821
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,200
It's the beginning of Daddy's Tour Scode Episode 3, 3, 3, May 21, 2010

822
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Let me guide you through the tracks and the soundtrack of your life

823
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Member Jay Ferguson, Thunder Island

824
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,200
It's not here's a little light

825
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,720
The moment you're with me

826
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:27,060
Think in the sun with your hair I'm done

827
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,240
Can you hear me now coming in there and coming

828
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,340
Come across the bay

829
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,840
We see someone steak

830
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,020
We laugh it in the hi-tit

831
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,620
Chase a blow

832
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,520
Out of thunder

833
01:03:45,200 --> 01:04:15,200

835
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:57,200
I love a close until the storm passed and we fell down laughing in the wet grass

836
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:03,200
What the body's drying in the sunshine sweet sunshine

837
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,200
So shine light, light, light, light, light, light, light, light

838
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,200
In the sun with your dress I'm done

839
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Now I'll be by the way and I'll be naked to little the deeper

840
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:25,200
I'll remember the night in the cool sand, make it look

841
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,200
I don't find the right hand

842
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,200
See this beauty in the red sky

843
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,220
Hey

844
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:40,220

Night in the fresh everything

846
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,200
I need you

847
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:53,200
All that I want is oh

848
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:22,920
And guys, so very bad influence on me.

849
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:34,040
I still got the housekeepers running around and like, FTW.

850
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:38,920
We always got the guy who was strange, but he's sitting there with a two-day beard growth

851
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,240
in the sweatpants with a grungy t-shirt on.

852
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,680
Of course, Miss Mickey's nowhere to be found today.

853
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,920
That's why I can kind of look the way I want to look.

854
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,600
Oh man, I am so loving the sound that I've got coming out of the rack that these songs,

855
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,280
this type of song sounds good again.

856
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,280
Requested by Paul Boyer, it's a good security song.

857
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,280
TSA?

858
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,280
Fuck you.

859
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,280
Donald Fagan on the Charlie.

860
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,440
Security Joan, listen to the lyrics, I think you're like this.

861
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:16,440
I guess I'm in it America, the files don't make my life.

862
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:24,440
I had to get to get to see the team, and it was still where I saw him.

863
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:32,440
The song is standing in my carry on like, it's off the X-ray machine.

864
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:41,440
It's been a change of faith in heaven, I still used to step behind the screen,

865
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:48,440
and when I felt someone to bother me, to know that I felt so clean,

866
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,440
now you won't find my name on your little table.

867
01:07:53,440 --> 01:08:01,440
If I look at you in the mirror, I'll just keep my shoes myself on.

868
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:08,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

878
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,420
that an iTunes.

879
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,700

But those of you wondering why it sounds like Steely Dan, that's because of course Donald

883
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:57,140
Fagan was the driving force and I would say was he not the lead singer of Steely Dan

884
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,140
makes so much sense.

885
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,140
Doesn't it?

886
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:03,980

887
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:09,340
things roll by that I think are excellent choices, so let me try this one out for size

888
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:13,740
home on the second and it's just got to load up oh this is a cool idea I don't know

889
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:18,260
I just kind of got in the vibe and like yeah let's just place some songs man let's share
