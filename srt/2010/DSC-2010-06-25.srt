We're late, we're going home, we're left inside

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They'd let John and Robin ring on the ring

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We're the least out of the station in the ride

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And it's a two-ball six-layer in the two-layer

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They know you're setting up for the back of my neck

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They know what a good-looking man you know

116

But the ring don't boot you to choose to lose the turtles

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know what I know when you're acting right all wrong

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No one knows if you know we're leaving nowhere

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Gotta keep on going home with a morning light

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Two, four, six, eight, never too late

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Just be my regular group tonight

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Three, five, seven, nine, couple, one, nine

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000

But table, we're sun coming up with a morning light

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We're sun coming up with a morning light

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All right, so I figured out what was going on with the sound set

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It seems like my housekeeper cleaned the mixer

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She had just a couple of knobs for it

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Basically, over modulating the entire system

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was just happy

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
To roll up some band right there at the top of didn't source code

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Three, six, two, four, six, eight, motorway

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Going back to the mid 70s

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And it's an all-request footballer Friday

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've been very busy writing them all down

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Searching the iTunes door and finding what you want to hear

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Today to get your weekend started

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Time's up time

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Time's up time

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
See what's become of me

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
All right, so I figured out what was going on with the sound set

See what's become of me

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
All right, I looked around

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
All my possibilities

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was so hard to please

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The ground

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's a ground

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Time's up

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's a haze

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's a sailor

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Winter

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In my salvation I'll be found

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Down by the side

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's bound to be a better eye

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Than what you've got planned

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Carey your career

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The ground

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's a ground

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He's a haze

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's a haze

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's a winter

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I'll tell you how it's my friend

176

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,500

last week. So be prepared for a very wild ride indeed, you chuckle heads.

302
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,080
Play something you never hear on the radio. Only a live version of a song.

303
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,040
Only the direst rates can really pull it off every single time consistently the substance of swing

304
