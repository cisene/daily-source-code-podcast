time on the operation of the machine become so

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
OAS makes you so sick and hard that you can't take part

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,680
you can't even passively take part and you've got to put your bodies

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,280
upon the gears and upon the wheels upon the levers

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,240
pile the apparatus and you've got to make it stop

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:42,060
For 16.57 minutes you're in 5-9

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,240
Time down you・ spanking, to say face

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,620
I'll know can you go, talk a lot of game on yen you know

10
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,860
Static on the way, make us all say,

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,860
Whoa, the people up top push the people down low, get down

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,700
And don't be every moron,

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,140
Static get mad if you haven't yet heard,

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,900
Gonna take what I got, don't be absurd,

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,620
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,740
If you've ever heard it down, then you go very shit

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,740
We don't run, we're in the guns, I know

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,060
And look when make a move, there's my people say,

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,660
So got everything out of control, never everybody go

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,700
Every way, we don't run, we're in the talk

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:35,680
Give us the money, ourcription,

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,440
Or how do we guard the words?

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,400
So a lot of this change in his voice will tell us

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,460
We get your thoughts out of control,

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,260
The people are up top and up you put down the kick down

26
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,020
And I'm running it like that

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,700
The fun and the attack is exactly what I'm at

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,140
Someone between a kick and a high hat

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,820
A pin in a contract, a pitch in a contract

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,420
So give us a combat and I'm letting them know

31
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,820
They're ain't shit, you can see them in me back down

32
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,140
I know so, push the button, let go

33
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,740
Think most, it ain't everything that I control

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,140
Everybody go

35
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260

A little bit of a Lincoln park to kick off with food bar Friday.

49
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Everybody just didn't source code episode 846 coming to you from the hilltop watch tower correct

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
My command center

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Who baby I am once again tripping on aspirin coding nicotine

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,920
And something from Mexico would be a corona. Let's rock this puppy out

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm shovelin to take the sand

54
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,920
But my head's in Mississippi

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm shovelin to take the sand

56
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,920
But my head's in Mississippi

57
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Theblees has got a hole in me

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:21,920
I believe I'm can't dissee

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
But I wasn't heaven

60
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,620
I can't forgive my man, I'm a night in my first dream

61
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
I thought I was heaven

62
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,420
But I was jumped into the parking lot

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,720
But then it feels a little silly, a little bit

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,720
And it feels like a little too

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,220
But I was jumped into the parking lot

66
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,720
And it feels a little silly, a little bit

67
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
And it feels like a little too silly

68
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,720
And as night I saw a lake of cappella

69
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
She was full to call for sleep in me

70
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,720
She was home in peace from how they were

71
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
About some new years

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,720
And as night I saw a lake of cappella

73
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
She was full to call for sleep in me

74
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
About some new years

75
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,720
And as night I saw a lake of cappella

76
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
She was full to call for sleep in me

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
About some new years

78
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:44,720
And as night I saw a lake of cappella

79
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:54,720
And as night I saw a lake of cappella

80
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720

So when I saw i saw someramble

82
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm still kind of recuperating from, I don't know if it was a super duper jet lag,

83
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,760
or if it was just, I don't know, some kind of 24-hour flu bugs.

84
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,800
So I'm not sure how much energy you'll have to make it through the entire projected

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,120
three hours of the day to source code today, but I've got everybody hanging out in the

86
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,800
chat room, no agenda chat.net, as we are live and no agenda stream.com, and you know what

87
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,440
we have to do, we've got to go out and we've got to propagate the formula.

88
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,760
Remember, it's on the inspiration time to say, I'm formula is this, we go out, we hit

100
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Why the air waves?

101
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm running out of steam already.

102
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I think I need another sip of this corona, that'll probably help me out just a little bit.

103
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Hey, excellent, excellent song choices.

104
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,640

Pop the mud, stole.

110
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Kind of the way I'm feeling right now.

111
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I gotta get this shit out of my chest.

112
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
I know this sucker behind the desk.

113
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,640
You try to tell me that you know best.

114
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Without your fingers, without your head.

115
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
It's sunshine.

116
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
It's how it feels to me.

117
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
But I can't because of it.

118
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
It's a new dream.

119
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
It's a new view.

120
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
It's a fire.

121
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,640
It's a fire.

122
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm so chill like you.

123
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
I gotta chill at the front door.

124
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
When I get the time to take you.

125
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I don't understand why I'm so well-o-o.

126
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm thinking that I'm not a fist-o.

127
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Yeah!

128
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,640
I gotta get this shit out of my back.

129
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I run and suck those blood out.

130
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
I won't crack.

131
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,640
So fucking sick of your heart at the desk.

132
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
You're a young thing.

133
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
I stop your name.

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,640
The sunshine is on its way to me.

135
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm not a camera call.

136
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,640
It's a new dream.

137
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
It's something you've wired.

138
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Get an iron.

139
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm so chill like you.

140
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I gotta chill at the front door.

141
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
When I get the time to take you.

142
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,640
I don't understand why I'm so well-o-o.

143
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,640
I'm thinking that I'm not a fist-o-o.

144
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Why do I always waste my time?

145
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,640
No, no, no.

146
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Yeah, I'm thinking that I'm not a fist-o-o.

147
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,640
I am my worst-a-pin liar.

148
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Fucking liar.

149
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
So chill like you.

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
I gotta chill at the front door.

151
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,640
When I get the time to take you.

152
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I run and suck those blood out.

153
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,640

To a whole new level

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,480
Been out on the road for over a week. Get my nation lowlands met a lot of

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
So I've been out Roman

I

273
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:20,620
In a road begun, I'm afraid I am stripped of all my pride

274
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:27,620
So in her I do goodbye, and she keeps me set as fire

275
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Gives me a warning, and the dust in the drug that creed

276
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Only knowledge will I save, to the game you still save

277
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,620
Move on, run, run, you man, back up on, don't need what you will

278
00:21:49,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Oh, I'll take my time anyway, free to speak my mind anyway

To the unknown, I don't want to resign through

By myself, I'm not a law, I asked no one, it like size I've severed

Let's buy out the more I can, what the being better I bring

Maybe it's just recovering from the sickness that I'm reminiscing a little bit

304

But I'll take my time anyway, free to speak my mind

Ain't no pussy when she's gone

318
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,620
It's my hand when she's away

319
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,620

320

00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:15,620
A county hurts the unfair

322
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,620
I wrapped my dick in my big mass

323
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,620
I shared my birthday with my boss

324
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,620
He said I love the secret sauce

00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Oh, what's your man at the back?

332
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,620
It's a matter of fact, size, it was red at the sun

333
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,620
And the girl is a cold, and no one ignore anything

334
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
She's the passionate one

335
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,620
Oh, yeah, it's like lightning, everybody was fighting

336
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,620
But the music was soothing, and they all started to ruby

337
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,620
I'm the man at the back, she's the every one attack

338
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,620
And the girl is the cold, and no one ignore anything

339
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,620
She's the passionate one, no one ignore anything

340
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,620
All right, we're getting so stressed, I like to tell you everything

All right, we're getting so stressed, I like to say everything

346
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,620
And the girl is everything, since six days, it has been so easy

347
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:18,620
All right, buddy, now that the man's the back of the red is more than anything

348
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:45,580
You can take that to the bank.

349
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,580
Put down your speakers!

350
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Oh shit!

351
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Oh yeah!

352
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580

353
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Everybody was wife thing!

354
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
My music was soothing!

355
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
But the old story is booming!

356
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Oh baby!

357
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580

360
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,580
And the man of the box said it!

361
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Everybody jacked!

362
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
And he jacked it to a ballroom place!

363
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
And the girl in the corner said fire!

364
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Everybody will tell you about who you listen!

365
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Ballroom place!

366
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580

It is a ballroom place!

378
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Nothing like a little bit of 70s jam on the Charlie.

379
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,580
I'm getting my second man name in my third win by now!

380
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,580
And ramping it up, I was prepping for the show,

381
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
looking through all the Gmail, seeing what I could find,

382
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,580

383
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580

384
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,580

473
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:01,360
The audience is still there, you stupid dick-wad music directors and program directors

474
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,740
who think you know what you're doing, spit not everything on computers, you've ruined

475
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,740
radio.

476
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,140
That's why we're here.

477
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,420
And I got a couple of requests that came in and you can always email the to me at

478
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,180
them at curie.com and I have a Dropbox account as well by the way.

479
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,180
So if whenever you put something in a Dropbox, especially who are sharing music,

480
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,940
I really, it's very handy for me for a number of reasons so that would be highly appreciated.

481
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,940
This one comes from down.

482
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:31,220
And bloody curie, snafu Saturday, wasn't that an outrageously good particular episode

483
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,860
of the Daily Source Code.

484
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,660
If you don't know the Daily Source Code, go check it out, people, you'll have an amazing

485
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,620
time he's playing the soundtrack's of our life.

486
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:44,980
And my life in particular, Adam, I'm four years older than you buddy, and that is exactly

487
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,300
the soundtrack of my life.

488
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,180
But mate, you've missed one track, one track that I'm going to email to you so that you

489
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,180
can play it.

490
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,460
It's my Russell Morris, the Australian artist.

491
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,460
You may not even know of him.

492
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,620
I'm surprised if you haven't because this is an outrageously good song.

493
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,740
This song is not a song.

494
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,300
It's not even an opus.

495
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,420
It's a religious experience.

496
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,420
And I want you to play it as a soundtrack to my life and the soundtrack to all Australians

497
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,660
lives for anybody who's over 30.

498
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,820
I'm sure you've heard of it.

499
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:20,300
This is Russell Morris and the real thing.

500
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:27,300
Come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing,

503
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,300

00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:56,300
come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing,

509
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,300
come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing,

510
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,300
come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing, come and see the real thing,

511
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,300
Love, I believe that I've really been

We'll make you come and see

521
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,300
We'll make you come and see

522
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,300
We'll make you come and see

We'll make you come and see

And I'm not too sweet, I'm not too sweet

531
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,300
I'm not too sweet, I'm not too sweet

532
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,300
I'm not too sweet, I'm not too sweet
