1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 851, the food bar fucking Friday.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're 60 minutes to set minutes and show you five rounds of time.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's minutes, the 25th century of radio starts here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We don't need enough thinking.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Kriss didn't mean me alive.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I know it's in the street, I'm broadcasting.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For more Friday, it's quick time.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're the reason.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come on, slaves.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Can't you do it to me all night?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
She was a fast machine.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She caught the water.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Cleans your wildest fouls.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Get a woman out of here.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Ever seen she had to sack your size.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Get a man out of there.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And knock on me out for those America.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The last taker you're all in the shell.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hand me fighting for fear.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She told me to come, but I was all ready there.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Got the wildest hot chicken.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That was quick in my mouth.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Say it again.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We won't make you lose you.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Should be all night now.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Get you.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Should be all night now.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The double time will not seduction law.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She's one of a kind to judge.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What a nerve.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Those are just another.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Call me and be a lot of me.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And come back for all night.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Have to cool it down.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Take a nerve round.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now it's back in the ring.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
To take another swing.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That the wild's wild's shaken.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The wild's quaking my mouth.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Say it again.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We won't make you lose you.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Should be all night now.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Get you.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Should be all night now.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The double time will not seduction law.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She's one of a kind to judge.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's one of a kind to judge.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Should be all night now.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Get you.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We won't make you lose you.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Should be all night now.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Should be all night now.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Should be all night now.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Should be all night now.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Bring it back to the Arctic Radio.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Globally the way it used to be back in the old days.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now on your ephones.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
On your computer screens.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's all over the place.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a daily source code.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The full bar Friday episode.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Five-one coming you from the Hilltop Rocks Tower.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Black Rock Command Center.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I am your humble human resource.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're slaves.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He had to bring you the tunes that you're dropping in my box.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We got to fill up with some more cowbell.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's what I'm looking for.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
By the way, in case you didn't know it's time to lay down works.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Stop what you're doing.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's the full bar.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just what we do.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go agenda chat on that where the party has happened.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right now.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's see now.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So bad and pretty.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Booly with the style and ease.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And I feel like.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
From a classroom.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's it's love in the bird's degree.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, baby baby.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I want you.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Tell you about my heart.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, baby baby.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
To your taste.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're only enough to dance.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Love away.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, love away.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
To the life away.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A life while.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, you'll be beautiful but just watch.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And baby go.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She's all bad.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Just what you're선.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
You're nothing,

98
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll give you leave if she knows.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, baby baby sure.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Tell you about where.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, baby baby.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're only enough to dance.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The night when.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:06:09,500
There is definitely something about sitting in Southern California and playing

106
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,220
Diamond David Lee Roth, back in the old band Hale and Dave's damn tonight away.

107
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,220
It just feels so incredibly good.

108
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,100
I can't see the cam trails today because of the cloud cover, but we do have some sun

109
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,180
coming through here briefly at the Crackbox Command Center.

110
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,140
We're high up on top of the hilltop watch tower, Crackbox Command Center, and later on,

111
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,700
your dedication is a request by a Skype on the show.

112
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:42,060
It gets your song's tracks, we need a real break, it's all shake up, we're having

113
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:53,000
told about you, but we're not so good, we won't be in shame on the truth, we're in our

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,720
home.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,540
Oh, I'm gonna be around

116
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, I'm gonna be around

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh, I'm gonna be around

118
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay?

119
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:47,700
Open the thirty,

120
00:07:47,700 --> 00:08:17,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no way, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you, you, no, no, no, no, you, no, no, no. No, no, no.

122
00:08:47,700 --> 00:09:17,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

124
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,700
It's time to put down your head with some hope in it.

125
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Now you'll miss a winner.

126
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Now you'll miss a winner.

127
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Take it home.

128
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Take it home.

129
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh yeah.

130
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Now you'll miss a winner.

131
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
It's time to put down your head with some hope in it.

132
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Dennis Horses got a 5-1.

133
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm out.

134
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm curry.

135
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
My only job here is to make your ears bleed.

136
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm going to try to do just that.

137
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
As we get rolling into the weekend.

138
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Could he be playing an instrumental song?

139
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Oh no.

140
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
You can't play that on a radio.

141
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Someone's got a sink.

142
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
He's got a last 3 minutes and 32 seconds.

143
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,700
That will be so long.

144
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Frankenstein.

145
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Oh yeah.

146
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Oh yeah.

147
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Oh yeah.

148
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Oh yeah.

149
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Oh yeah.

150
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Oh yeah.

151
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Oh yeah.

152
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Oh yeah.

Oh yeah.

Oh yeah.

155
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Oh yeah.

156
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
Oh yeah.

157
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Oh yeah.

158
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Oh yeah.

159
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Oh yeah.

160
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Oh yeah.

161
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Oh yeah.

162
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Oh yeah.

163
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Oh yeah.

164
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Oh yeah.

165
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Oh yeah.

166
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Oh yeah.

167
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Oh yeah.

168
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Oh yeah.

169
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Oh yeah.

170

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

The other loves can't chase an old stream.

301
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,780
Sitting in a swim guitar, his knees, sinking tired of the snowing tail.

302
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Knows him well, he can roll the clouds.

303
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,780
One way to keep one way, man

304
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,780
Rise and bust, make new tonight

305
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,780
The city of angels, the city of dream

306
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,780
The city is the one thing needs

307
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,780
You gotta go with what you know

308
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,780
What are you doing with me?

309
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,780
What are you doing with me?

310
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,780

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,780
What are you doing with me?

313
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,780

You know how I can cross one of the next two

315
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,780
All right, here's a little test you can perform right now

316
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,780
If you're listening to the sound of my voice

317
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,780
And you have headphones on or earbudging

318
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,780
Take out the headphones, take out the earbud and check

319
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Is there a trickle of blood?

320
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
No?

321
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,780
Well, then we can fix that

322
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,780

471
00:43:52,780 --> 00:44:15,460
Only the road again.

472
00:44:45,460 --> 00:45:15,460

478
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,540
I think that would kick some ass and please, by the way, when you listen to this program,

479
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:55,860
if you have downloaded it, do me a favor and burn that onto a CD and stick it onto a

480
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,540
USB sticks and just stick it in your shit somewhere.

481
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,980
So in a hundred years from now, when historians are looking through all of our,

482
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,540
because the hard drives, of course, will fail, even the, even the CDs probably won't be

483
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,460
readable anymore, but it would be nice if someone could find this and say, wow,

484
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,020
those guys were in some crazy shit back in the day, weren't they?

485
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,180
Hmm, that's interesting. Stupid slaves.

486
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,140
So our president, just at least in get my nation west, our president and a get my nation

487
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,580
proper was on the Ministry of Truth channel.

488
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:32,340
Oh, yes. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I can't wait to talk Sunday in the morning with John about this one.

489
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,740
Well, these, these, these, these just baggage of toner from Yemen,

490
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,780
because that's where I get all my toner shipped in from.

491
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,380
Indeed contained explosive material.

492
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:51,460
Okay. So first of all, enhance pat downs, everybody. TSA to grab your crotch, opt out,

493
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,940
do not go through the naked body skin as refuse at all times, and second, of course, it's time

494
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:01,380
to a march into Yemen because we can do some amazing horizontal drilling right into the oil

495
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:07,780
feeds of fields of Saudi Arabia. It's amazing how simple it is when you are awake and know how it works.

496
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,980
More I know agenda Monday, a Sunday morning in the morning.

497
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,140
This is the greatest and best song in the world.

498
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:22,740
Trippied.

499
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,700
Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here.

500
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:38,100
We was hitchhiking down along along some road, all of a sudden.

501
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:45,300
They're shined a shiny demon in the middle of the road.

502
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:56,180
And he said, play the best song in the world, or I'll eat yourselves.

503
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,780
Well, me and Kyle, we looked at each other and we each said,

504
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:16,420
okay, and we played the first thing that came to our heads, and just so happened to be the best song in the world.

505
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,900
It was the best song in the world.

506
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:25,860
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see what I want me to do and what I'm making today is destiny.

507
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:34,100
Once and it's time for me and the soul, when the sun does shine and the moon does grow and the dust does grow.

508
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:47,460
Needless to say, the beast must stun us, or when crack with his rubber tail, and the beast was done.

509
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:58,580
He asked us, be your angels, and we said nay, we are but men rock,

510
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:13,620
well, I know, this is not the greatest song in the world now.

511
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,420
This is just a tribute.

512
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:26,100
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world now, no, this is a tribute.

513
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,340
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

514
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:26,100
oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh

515
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,300
I literally am proud to be a mother fucking fucking bitch!

516
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,100
Oh!

517
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,100
Oh!

518
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,100
Oh!

519
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,100
Oh!

520
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,100
Oh!

521
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,100
Oh!

522
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,100
Oh!

523
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,100
Oh!

524
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,100
Oh!

525
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,100
Oh!

526
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,100
Oh!

527
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,100
Oh!

528
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,100
Oh!

529
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,100
Oh!

530
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,100
Oh!

531
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Oh!

532
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Oh!

533
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,100
Oh!

534
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,100
Oh!

535
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,100
Oh!

536
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,100
No doubt about it.

537
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,100
That is without doubt the best song in the motherfucking world.

538
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,100
I mean, there's just no way you can deny it.

539
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,100
That's what it is.

540
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,100
Totally tenacious D and tribute.

541
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
Everybody stand up.

542
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,100
No ladies and gentlemen, please rise for your get-mo nation.

543
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,100
National anthem.

544
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Second law.

545
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,100
In the morning get-mo nation.

546
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:24,100
We are all charged up to be human resources and service.

547
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:29,100
In all lands and all ships and seas.

548
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:38,100
From the east to west down north to the lowlands and beyond.

549
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:44,100
We are happy and distracted slaves.

550
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,100
We are here for nation's home.

551
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:55,100

00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,100
Awesome.

659
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,100
Hell yeah.

660
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,100
It's spreading my friends.

661
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,100
Absolutely.

662
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:45,100
I'm trying to find the right songs to play on today's show because of this craziness

663
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,100
that has come and down the pike now with the explosive material.

664
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,100
I mean, it's like the whole script was set up.

665
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,100
You know, does the president really need to come out and say that,

666
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,100
oh, it had exposed a material.

667
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:00,100
Of course, I will immediately confess that

668
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:07,100
there's more than one bottle of corona here on the table.

669
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,100
Yes.

670
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,100
Warnings, the slave is drinking.

671
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,100
Be very careful.

672
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,100
He may start to see things in sound incredibly like the truth.

673
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,100
We must shut him up.

674
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,100
This cannot be.

675
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:29,100
Because as you know, the newer things have taken over the asylum and the way we like it to be.

676
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,100
That shouldn't have let him touch a brush.

677
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,100
That's right for the body standard.

678
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,100
Clean it for the cynics.

679
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,100
Oh, once it's west of the people's wrist.

680
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:43,100
Oh, you know what you never knew we made.

681
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,100
Oh, we're all wounded on the wrist.

682
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,100
Oh, we're all wounded on the wrist.

683
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,100
Oh, we're all wounded on the wrist.

684
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:02,100
Oh, we're all wounded on the wrist.

685
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,100
Don't look near the Calvator ness.

686
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,100
Oh, let's kill him like you disagree with this morning's case.

687
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,100
Oh, there's a man around next to switch.

688
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,100
Oh, and the clear will go for me.

689
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:24,100
Oh, we're all wounded on the wrist.

690
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:54,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

691
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:05,940
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I'm not gonna fuck.

692
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:12,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

693
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:21,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

694
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:29,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

695
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:39,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

696
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

697
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:55,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

698
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

699
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:09,940
Tell me if it's empty, then nobody is fine

700
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,940
While everyone remembers that one

701
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,580
Fun boy three, of course they had a huge hit with banana ramey and what you do is the way that you do it

702
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,580
This was actually I think it was from a motion picture soundtrack

703
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,580
But I do remember playing that back in the old days

704
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,300
Yeah

705
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,580
Well, let's see we can get into a little different mood here for a second. Then give me some crazy like that

706
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,580
Yeah crazy bass kind of guitar and then hit me with some drums

707
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:51,940
Whatever happens to, Liam's trying to say, he got a nice pick

708
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:58,940
That made his new spell, whatever happens to you

709
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,940
Do land here, to play on me raw

710
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,940
An essential pencil

711
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,940
Whatever happens to, Liam's

712
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,940
Whatever happens to, what he does

713
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,940
Whatever happens to, on the heroes

714
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,940
Other Shakespeare's

715
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,940
They watch their own bun

716
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:38,940
Whatever happens to, on the heroes

717
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:44,940
Whatever happens to, on the heroes

718
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:52,940
Now for heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore

719
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,940
No more heroes anymore

720
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:38,940
No more heroes anymore

721
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,940
Whatever happens to, on the heroes

722
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,940
Other Shakespeare's

723
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,940
They watch their own bun

724
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,940
Whatever happens to, on the heroes

725
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,940

No more heroes anymore

729
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,940
Stranglers, no more heroes anymore

730
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,940
Whatever happens to, on the heroes

731
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,940
Simply lost sight of them somehow

732
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,940
They're round of desserts really carefully

733
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,940
And you can't find them

734
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,940
Some of them might even be chuckle heads

735
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,940
Or as we now say, meal confederates

736
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:53,940
Hell yeah

737
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,940
Well man, I've had an incredibly busy week

738
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,940
Of course, every single day

739
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,940
I need to get a couple episodes out

740
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:02,940
Now double the work loaders

741
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:06,940
We're doing the big app show on iPhone and on Android

742
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:10,940
So I kind of, you know, so if I want to do three episodes in advance

743
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:11,940
I basically have to do six

744
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,940
Every day though there's editing involved

745
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,940
Still have not found an intern I can pay some patents to help me out

746
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,940
And also still not found a real way to make money off of it

747
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,940
But I'm enjoying it, I'm certainly learning a lot about apps

748
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,940
So let's see Monday

749
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,940
My day was interrupted although pleasantly

750
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,940
By a lunch with the lovely Victoria Ricanio

751
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,940
Who some of you may remember from, I think, tech TV

752
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,940
But I met her at John C. Devorex

753
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,940
Thanksgiving Party last year

754
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:40,940
I dinner, I should say

755
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,940
And oh, what a lovely girl that is

756
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,940
So we bitched him on about the television industry

757
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,940
That's always fun

758
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,940
Then on Tuesday, Chris Perchiers

759
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,940
The big man from Boise, Idaho, good friend

760
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,940
Who is a documentary filmmaker

761
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,940
And SEO expert

762
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,940
The guy, the two kind of go hand in hand

763
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,940
Had lunch with him and the lovely Miss Anne

764
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,940
Then on Wednesday

765
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,940
The incredible Super Agent Matthew Lescher

766
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,940
Who is scouring the Hollywood

767
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,940
Work scene for Christina

768
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,940
And also working, she's the one by the way

769
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,940
That gets me the celebrity interviews with the big app show

770
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,940
We've got some pretty cool ones coming up

771
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,940
We're still working on the hoff

772
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,940
The hoff is hard to pin down

773
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,940
Because he's insane

774
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,940
We've got, we see the Super Star girl from Little Liers

775
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,940
Coming up soon on the app show

776
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,940
We've got, oh, what's her name?

777
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,940
Smoking Hot Alien from V

778
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,940
You know, the leader of the, of the, of the alien

779
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,940
She'll be on soon

780
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:41,940
And I think actually next week

781
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,940
I have a Rick Schwartz back on

782
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:45,940
From Yahoo's fantasy football life

783
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,940
So it's definitely starting to be something that's kind of on the circuit

784
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,940
So, you know, all I know is once you have audience

785
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,940
Then somehow money usually follows

786
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,940
So hopefully, well, it probably took 18 months

787
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,940
It always does with stuff on the internet

788
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,940
And I do appreciate all you guys blogging about it

789
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,940
I wouldn't mind a little bit of help on the android version

790
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,940
If you could let people know that it's available on android

791
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,940
I think I have about 10,000 installs

792
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,940
I'm not bad for the first month, but I need a little hit there

793
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:14,940
And if anyone works at Google

794
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,940
Who do I have to blow to get featured in the marketplace?

795
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,940
Please

796
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:22,940
Then yes, they had, I can't tell you too much about this one

797
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,940
Because I promised because it's, you know, we're still working on the concept

798
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:30,940
But I went on a road trip with the Eli Roth

799
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,940
Who, of course, is our favorite bear Jew from Inglories bastards

800
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:39,940
Also a fantastic director, producer of the horror genre

801
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:43,940
And we're working on a project which I'm very, I mean, I'm literally

802
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,940
I think about it, I get a boner

803
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,940
It'll be completely punk rock, very offensive

804
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,940
And I can't wait to share it with you guys

805
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:55,940
But need some work, so maybe around Christmas time

806
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,940
We hope to have something that we can show to the general human resources

807
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,940
And slaves

808
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:05,940
One hour into the show, time for Ray on the Charlie

809
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,940
All we want is Ray

810
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,940
Hey everybody, Ray Mold

811
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:10,940
Harvey

812
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,940
So today we're going to transport you back to the early 80s

813
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:18,940
Ladies and gentlemen

814
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:21,940
For other charcoal hats who didn't grew up in the Netherlands

815
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,940
Descible radio wasn't illegal radio station

816
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,940
In Amsterdam, in the 80s

817
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,940
This pirate radio station, focused on young Amsterdam, was mainly playing disco music

818
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,940
Imported from U.S. and U.K.

819
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,940
It was like the station called set

820
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,940
Tomorrow's music today

821
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,940
So what's Adam Kennedy with this?

822
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,940
Before Adam started his professional

823
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,940
Milty Media Hitman career

824
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,940
And did some radio programs

825
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,940
On Descible radio, under the alias

826
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,940
John Holden

827
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,940
Remember, it was the early 80s

828
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,940
Adam was, I think, 17, 18, 19 years old

829
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:03,940
At the time Captain John had to make his own jingles

830
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,940
Listen to this

831
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,940
So, sport you for Captain John

832
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,940
Fuck

833
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,940
To be

834
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,940
To be

835
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,940
To be

836
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
Ain't

837
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,940
Mission Control

838
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,940
This is Captain John, our sister is our go and our light's agreed

839
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,940
Where do you think of Mission Control?

840
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:21,940
We have a vlog

841
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:22,940
Major three, I can't hold him

842
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,940
She's breaking up, she's breaking up

843
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,940
Oh fuck Ray

844
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,940
John Holden

845
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,940
A man barely alive

846
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,940
We can rebuild him

847
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,940
We can make him stronger

848
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,940
Faster

849
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,940
Better than any man before

850
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:42,940
We can set that go

851
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,940
Six million dollar DJ

852
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,940
Captain John, your pilot of the airway

853
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,940
Captain Marilyn

854
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:52,940
Isn't this great?

855
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:53,940
No, it's embarrassing

856
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,940
This is our shuttle king, is he early?

857
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:56,940
Captain Skull

858
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,940
Holden

859
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:01,940
So, how did they sketch and John sound it on air?

860
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,940
Let's listen to some old air checks

861
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,940
Not your DC pad

862
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,940
DC fell heavy

863
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,940
Culture club

864
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:14,940
You're here, you want to hurt me

865
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,940
You're here, you want to make me cry

866
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,940
Because you're club room that I'm kissing to be clever

867
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,940
But everybody

868
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:24,940
Version records on tape

869
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,940
We have a fabulous phone in and about 12 minutes here

870
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,940
And you can do it

871
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:32,940
One eight four, one six eight

872
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,940
But of course you can do that same number right now

873
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,940
Ooh, you've got to go ahead with the whole group

874
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:37,940
That'll be it

875
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:39,940
One eight four, one six eight

876
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,940
Do you be ready to talk to me live at first

877
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,940
Good morning

878
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,940
Hello

879
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,940
Hello

880
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,940
Who's this speaker, please?

881
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,940
Alina

882
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,940
Hello, Alina

883
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:48,940
How are you?

884
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,940
I'm fine

885
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,940
Well, a very good morning to you

886
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,940
Yeah, it's easy

887
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,940
So how much you grew to there, Alina?

888
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,940
Yeah, I want to do it

889
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,940
My creatures to try to shoot paper from the law for cleaning

890
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,940
Biggest degrees in the old rocker old star

891
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,940
Cliff Richard

892
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,940
Where do we go from here?

893
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,940
All right there, why do you have to be a hardbreaker?

894
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,940
14 best, the hour 14 best nine

895
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,940
18th of

896
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,940
What's the mind?

897
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,940
Oh, yeah, that's october, right?

898
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,940
It's still a little bit sleepy

899
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,940
You're working to be in your car

900
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,940
You're working to be in your car

901
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,940
You're working to be in your car

902
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,940
You know, weekend radio, I'll give you radio

903
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,940
I know you six more and two

904
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,940
Soundtrack to my life

905
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,940
So you still got your headphones on and I'm

906
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,940
Yeah, barely right

907
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:46,940
I have to be honest with you

908
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,940
Chocolate hats

909
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:51,940
When Adam did some radio work for decibel radio

910
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,940
I was ten years old

911
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,940
I didn't even listen to that radio station

912
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:58,940
I was only watching bushy and Adriano

913
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,940
Whatever

914
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,940
But my older friend, Kay, told me

915
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,940
There's a particular song that reminded him of decibel radio

916
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,940
Soundtrack to my life

917
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,940
The rhythm advanced to down

918
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,940
66 hours per weekend

919
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,940
This soundtrack was the last single

920
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,940
To be released before the band split up in 1983

921
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,940
DB music

922
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,940
Missing it is out of the question

923
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,940
It was used by decibel radio

924
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,940
On the top of the hour set it on the one from music

925
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,940
96 point of view

926
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:33,940
Adam Curie, Elias John Holden on the wheels of steel

927
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,940
Playing thin lissie

928
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,940
The sun goes down

929
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,940
Can we show all of very nice weekend

930
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,940
That by now

931
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,940
There is a day

932
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,940
We're almost lost

933
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:55,940
This is the blinds of hell

934
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,940
Sentia to the days

935
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:10,940
She knows that I don't want to run

936
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:17,940
She comes close, she comes close

937
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,940
She knows that I don't want to run

938
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:31,940
But my older friend, Kay, told me

939
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:34,940
There's a new song

940
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,940
The sun goes down

941
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,940
The sun goes down

942
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,940
The sun goes down

943
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:04,940
She tries to be a little bit more

944
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:08,940
She tries to be a little bit more

945
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:15,940
But she is still captured, captured by his head

946
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,940
She knows that I don't want to run

947
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,940
She knows that I don't want to run

948
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:31,940
She knows that I don't want to run

949
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:38,940
She comes close, she comes close

950
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:46,940
She knows that I don't want to run

951
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:53,940
But my older friend, Kay, told me

952
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,940
The sun goes down

953
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,940
The sun goes down

954
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,940
The sun goes down

955
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,940
The sun goes down

956
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:53,940

961
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:16,940
The sun goes down

962
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:23,940
The sun goes down

The sun goes down

The sun goes down

965
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:51,940
She tries to listen to the see-through

966
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,940
The sun goes down

967
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:13,940
Well, well, well, well, well, Ray

Got to move to the trick I'd be

1000
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,940
That isn't all I need

1001
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,940
Just take it but it's too dry

1002
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:38,940
I'll be crazy, I'll be crazy

1003
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:46,940

1017
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:51,620
Grab a seat, grab a seat, yeah, grab a seat, yeah

1018
01:23:51,620 --> 01:24:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, grab a seat, yeah

1019
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,240
Yeah, the heart

1020
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:54,560
It's exactly the kind of track I need to load up into the CD player of the 99.99 sub-9 or 0.3 top-down

1021
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,840
cruising around perfect sniffing the tears have not heard this version before from driver

1022
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:03,440
seat but of course that's the whole point here is the chuckle head around the world but to show

1023
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:08,080
together the way it works is get yourself a drop-box account loaded up with some tunes

1024
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:14,800
and then invite me to share the folder with you working with a couple of guys in the chat room

1025
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:21,440
no Jenna chat.net to set it up on the newly acquired network area server so that I don't have

1026
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,200
what is it now it's up to like 20 gigabytes now and it's all in the MacBook Pro actually thank you so much

1027
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,520
from your no agenda support donations I was able to purchase a network area

1028
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,920
storage device of course I did do the research and it's funny how you know you can

1029
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,640
everyone it's like religion is what this is you know this one sucks that one's better

1030
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:48,400
this is the best that one blew up on me and I basically was going for price and performance and of

1031
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:54,560
course the hard drives are really the most important thing so I did go for a ready NES duo which

1032
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,840
you know I think was the best choice available it's been moving all of the stuff I have so many

1033
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,120
archives of things people have sent and stuff we just need to keep and need to keep with

1034
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:10,400
prosperity but also to access from other computers at the same time it's just it's incredible

1035
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:17,440
how much data is being chewed up doing all of this stuff here but the Dropbox solution has not

1036
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,440
yet been found although I think vision in the chat room has something for me it looks like he might

1037
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,760
have compiled a python version that I can then load up on this arm-based processor.

1038
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:35,360
sounds like actual work so the Dropbox right now just filling up my hard drive but it's good

1039
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,640
and what's kind of cool is I set the viewer window to date modified so when someone updates the

1040
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,480
Dropbox then their Dropbox pops up to the top of the stack and it's right at the top of the list

1041
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,480
so I know there's a new track in there I'd love to get some of the chuckle heads on and we did it

1042
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:55,120
on the last show last week on the snafu Saturday had you guys uh calling through Skype and I'd love

1043
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,960
to do that again to get some dedications going from around get monation the way you do it is

1044
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,840
after you set up and share to fold it with me in Dropbox then drop in a little text file with the

1045
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,160
song that you want to hear or whatever you want to do and then please add your Skype name and I

1046
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:13,360
will then contact you from the hilltop watch tower cracked by tonight's center could it be any

1047
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:18,960
simpler well yes it could but then again I'm just one guy here it's not like I got interns

1048
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:28,160
on the round to help me buddy it was some drop that it was on the wrong you know that

1049
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,280
and it's on the track and it's just you want to fall on our Friday

tubes running across the door, all the ways outside.

1057
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:16,540
It's all the always on the right, just as puntoвол is.

1058
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:22,540
It's all the way on.

01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:26,540
Um, what's your mama?

Right now.

1062
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,540
There's a hole over.

1063
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,540
Yeah!

1064
01:30:52,540 --> 01:31:02,540
I'm just broken.

1065
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,540
Just a thousand words.

1066
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:07,540
Anyhow, if I see you close to just a few words, I can't find out.

1067
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,540
You know what, yeah?

1068
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:13,540
Give me the gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1069
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:17,540
I give it all, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1070
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:20,540
I give it all, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1071
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:22,540
When I take a down, imagination, tell me.

1072
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:24,540
I'm just going to shake up down.

1073
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,540
But if I want to like a much lie, I'll put it on.

1074
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:30,540
I like a mama, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1075
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,540
I'm just a thousand words, I can't find out.

1076
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,540
I'm just going to take a down, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1077
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:38,540
What you want to, what you want, oh, I give the money with the money,

1078
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:39,540
that you want, oh, I give the money, that you want.

1079
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:43,540
I give it all, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1080
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,540
Give me the gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

1081
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,540
Yeah!

1082
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,540
Give one of them, that.

1083
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,540
Yeah!

1084
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:00,540
Only my dead love of the fan, man, I'm like,

1085
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:03,540
a big treat, well, I'm not much of a politician, he's here.

1086
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:04,540
Yeah!

1087
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,540
But much should be far, but that's what it's getting, man.

1088
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,540
I'm not gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.

1089
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:11,540
Oh, my god, no stop here!

1090
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:14,540
Sweet of energy, if you already whipped up the bike,

1091
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,540
oh my god, you gimme, a little bit too far.

1092
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,540
I'm not going to be far away to crush the cake!

1093
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,540
What the heck!

1094
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:22,540
When you're just in the middle of my mind,

1095
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,540
Would you know what you're hoping for?

1096
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,540
If not, believe me!

1097
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,540
I want you to see as much as you can, and you see me!

1098
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,540
I'll go man, I'll put you up there for a thing!

1099
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:34,540
I'm losing my mind, first time this time!

1100
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,540
I'm losing my mind, first time!

1101
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,540
I'm losing my mind, first time this time!

1102
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:40,540
I'm losing my mind, first time this time!

1103
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,540
I'm losing my mind!

1104
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,540
You're one of my best!

1105
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,540
I'm losing my mind, first time this time!

1106
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,540
Dangerous!

1107
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,540
Scattered swordsman was the battle for an old genius,

1108
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:44,540
I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I

1109
01:33:44,540 --> 01:34:14,540
I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm sorry, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I'm a little scared, I

1110
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:17,540
So answer the question. What you fucking worry?

1111
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:28,540
I'm fond memories of hanging out with the Beast of Boys of Montrose.

1112
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,540
Switzerland overturning cars. I'm sorry. That didn't actually happen.

1113
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:38,540
Beast of Boys actually coming from Sir Walters Dropbox, which I love this system.

1114
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:43,540
By the way, if I've played one of your songs, do me a favor and remove it from your Dropbox.

1115
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:49,540
So we can show up some space for some other human resource dropage to occur.

1116
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,540
In the morning to your Sir Walters.

1117
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:55,540
No, he was on mute probably.

1118
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,540
In the morning Adam and fellow chuckleheads.

1119
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:59,540
Yeah, how are you doing then?

1120
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,540
It's great to be on live Adam.

1121
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:05,540
Yeah, actually we're doing something completely new this time.

1122
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:12,540
I still have my Skype here at the Watch Tower set up to automatically accept and transmit video.

1123
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:18,540
And I only realize that when you flip down your video, I'm like, hey, he's trying, oh shit. He's looking at me too.

1124
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:26,540
Actually kind of gives a different dimension to it. Now I can see what all of the human resources look like is pretty awesome.

1125
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,540
So that's good to see your fully dressed Adam.

1126
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:33,540
Yes. Well, yes. You're only seeing the top half though, luckily.

1127
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:36,540
That's part of the good news. We'll see what he's drinking there.

1128
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:39,540
Sir Walters, I've got my corona here and what do you got?

1129
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,540
I'm drinking some red wine. Oh, very nice.

1130
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,540
Right. But you were drinking something else there from.

1131
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:47,540
I thought you were like, oh, I get just a glass of water to clear my throat.

1132
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:50,540
Oh, okay. Sounds like you're from Get Monation Lowlands.

1133
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:52,540
Yeah, true.

1134
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:55,540
Where in the lowland are you located?

1135
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,540
I live in Hill for some.

1136
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,540
No, really costs capital.

1137
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:04,540
Yes, yes, media central. Oh boy, you work in the business or you actually have a life.

1138
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:08,540
No, no, I don't have a life. I've got the AC and no agenda.

1139
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:11,540
But I've got a regular job.

1140
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:16,540
All right, Walter. Well, certainly appreciate your support of everything we're doing.

1141
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:20,540
Certainly, I know agenda. And what's the temperature like?

1142
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,540
I mean, the real the political climate and temperature of the lowlands right now.

1143
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:26,540
You guys finally have a government. What's happening?

1144
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,540
Well, we've got a government, but I don't think much is happening.

1145
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:33,540
They're just talking to say and bullshit at each government talks down there.

1146
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:35,540
Yeah, I guess so.

1147
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:40,540
A lot of talk about shutting down the internet, though, in the lowlands about restricting

1148
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:44,540
and blocking sites and all kinds of shit seems to be going on.

1149
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:48,540
Well, they're talking about it, but not much has happened so far.

1150
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,540
Hmm, okay. Well, that's the good news then.

1151
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:56,540
Sir Walter, you have a very interesting request.

1152
01:36:56,540 --> 01:37:00,540
Actually, something that I kind of glossed over didn't really mention it.

1153
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:04,540
I don't know if a lot of people know, but Solomon Burke, who, of course, is a legend.

1154
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:09,540
In what we call his genre, we call it soul.

1155
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:12,540
We call it, what would you call it, Walter?

1156
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:16,540
Well, someone once called him the King of Rock and Soul.

1157
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,540
Yeah, it's kind of a little bit of a hybrid.

1158
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:22,540
He passed away when he was on his way to the lowlands.

1159
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:25,540
And the story is a little, a little sketch.

1160
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:30,540
I'm not quite sure what happened, but I get to die on the airplane or like when he landed

1161
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:35,540
or he never got, he never actually entered the country, right?

1162
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:38,540
He didn't get through customs.

1163
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:43,540
Well, from what I got that he passed away after landing, but before getting off the plane.

1164
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,540
Shit, I forgot.

1165
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,540
And hard landings, but that really beats it, man.

1166
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,540
Kill the fucker passengers, that's no good.

1167
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:54,540
Yeah, it was actually coming to Amsterdam to do a show for promoting his collaboration album with The Dutch Band The Deck.

1168
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:56,540
Yeah, I didn't even know about them.

1169
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,540
Yeah, I didn't even know he had done that.

1170
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,540
And you have a track. Why don't you tell us about it?

1171
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,540
And I'll be happy to share it with the fellow chuckleheads.

1172
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:11,540
Well, The Deck is a Dutch sort of rock band and they've custom awesome songs in Dutch.

1173
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:17,540
And I'm not sure who translated it, but someone translated some of the lyrics into English.

1174
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:21,540
And the album is called Hold on tight.

1175
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:26,540
And the song I'd like to request is what a woman and his featuring Jules Holland.

1176
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:29,540
Wow, this is like a fantastic collaboration.

1177
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:32,540
The Deck, Solomon Burke, and Jules Holland, no less.

1178
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:37,540
Was this actually recorded in Holland, where was the track recorded?

1179
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:40,540
I haven't looked into that. I don't know where it was recorded.

1180
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:44,540
But one of the songs was on YouTube about a year ago.

1181
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,540
And I've been waiting for the album to be released.

1182
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:50,540
And just after it released he died.

1183
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:51,540
Wow.

1184
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,540
So, Rest in Peace.

1185
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:57,540
Post Jim is Salute from the chucklehead, Solomon Burke and The Deck.

1186
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,540
Featuring Jules Holland and Sir Waldo.

1187
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,540
Thank you very much for being on the show.

1188
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:04,540
And we'll talk to you Sunday in the morning.

1189
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,540
Thank you for having me at him.

1190
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:08,540
And I hope you'll enjoy the song.

1191
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,540
Turn it up.

1192
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:10,540
Yeah, you.

1193
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,540
Yesterday I was nowhere.

1194
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:28,540
There I'm back again.

1195
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:31,540
You're the sinner, but everything.

1196
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:34,540
And I feel 10 times a man.

1197
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:36,540
What a woman.

1198
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:38,540
What a woman.

1199
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,540
What a woman.

1200
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:43,540
What a woman.

1201
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,540
What a woman.

1202
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,540
What a woman.

1203
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:49,540
What a woman.

1204
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,540
I won't only sing those.

1205
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:55,540
I can't be beaten up.

1206
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,540
Life is chasing top, Vera.

1207
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,540
But the dance trying to stop

1208
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:02,540
Who what a woman.

1209
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:03,540
constrain.

1210
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:07,540
What a woman.

1211
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,540
She takes her higher.

1212
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,540
But you won't kill.

1213
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:14,540
Drive it down, extend to the ground.

1214
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:17,540
She gonna wreck you,

1215
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:21,540
Let's just make it feel just like the crowd

1216
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:25,540
Let's stand on our own

1217
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:29,540
We're all warm, all warm, all warm

1218
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,100
I egg

1219
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:51,560
Super boy

1220
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:55,540
If you give up, but you want to

1221
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:58,540
Drag it right down the ground

1222
01:40:58,540 --> 01:40:59,540
You're the badlongers

1223
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:02,540
Tell me there, spend your money

1224
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:04,540
Make it feel like the crowd

1225
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:10,420
If byeue you

1226
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:14,540
Yeah, steady, I will know where

1227
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:19,540
But yeah, back up here, but you didn't see them up.

1228
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:23,540
Prove everything, and I feel 20 times of man.

1229
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,540
The world of moments.

1230
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:29,540
Only what a world that is new for God.

1231
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:32,540
We are the world of woman.

1232
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,540
A real good woman.

1233
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:37,540
Let's not mess with man.

1234
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:38,540
What a woman.

1235
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:41,540
Who a world of woman is new.

1236
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:45,540
Hard to tell you what a woman...

1237
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:49,540
What a woman.

1238
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:50,540
Who are you?

1239
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,540
Who are you?

1240
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:54,540
We're harder than a woman.

1241
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:58,540
Whose a woman?

1242
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:00,540
My grandmother.

1243
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:03,540
Who are you?

1244
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:04,540
壯老師!

1245
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:05,540
I'm you,ули!

1246
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:09,540
I know but you!

1247
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:14,540
I want to tell the world, what am I going to do?

1248
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:18,540
Hey, try to breathe in!

1249
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:21,540
And you will live in the wind!

1250
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:27,540
Adam Curie, the second best thing you can do by yourself.

1251
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,540
In the morning!

1252
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:53,540
You're talking for my car when you're no other time.

1253
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:58,540
Now that I'm smiling, the girl is a speed I drive.

1254
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,540
You tell me it's all right.

1255
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:02,540
Your mind is a pain.

1256
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:06,540
You say you just want me to take you for the drive.

1257
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,540
You're just like a star.

1258
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,540
Say how to get through you.

1259
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:16,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1260
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:20,540
It's my heart that's slowing down.

1261
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:24,540
I'm trying to get off the side of time.

1262
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:29,540
I'm not the only source of cues of hip and man.

1263
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:32,540
Tired cracks all across your back of it.

1264
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,540
I can see you have just learned about it.

1265
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:38,540
Darling, can't you see my signals turn green to red.

1266
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,540
And what you are going to see a traffic jam.

1267
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,540
Stand up ahead.

1268
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:45,540
You are just right.

1269
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:48,540
So hard to get through you.

1270
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:52,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1271
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1272
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:56,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1273
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1274
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:00,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1275
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:04,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1276
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:08,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1277
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:09,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1278
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:12,040
I'm starting to cry for you.

1279
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,380
I'm starting to cry for you.

1280
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,540
I'm starting to cry for you.

1281
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,380
I'm starting to cry for you.

1282
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,180
I'm starting to cry for you.

1283
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:20,680
I'm starting to cry for you.

1284
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,520
I'm not starting to cry for you.

1285
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:23,520
I'm starting to cry for you.

1286
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:29,480
Jimmy, gross, a bit of cross-town traffic reminds me you've got to pick up the drive

1287
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,480
thing later.

1288
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:35,520
Thank you sir, Walter for his appearance on the Charlie along with his request for Solomon

1289
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,960
Burke Dijk and of course featuring Jewell's home.

1290
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,920
By the way, the Jimmy Hendrix song kind of reminds me of this a little bit.

1291
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:44,200
I don't know, it's just for some reason I feel like I've got to play this afternoon.

1292
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:51,200
As the girl, what you wanted to be, she said, baby, can't you see?

1293
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:59,200
I want to be famous, I stole the scream, but you can do something in between.

1294
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:06,200
Maybe you can drop my call, yes I'm gonna be a star.

1295
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:13,200
Maybe you can drop my call, and maybe I love you.

1296
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:19,200
I stole the girl and my prospects were good.

1297
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:23,200
And she said, baby, that's understood.

1298
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,200
Working with peanut, that's all very fun.

1299
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:30,200
But I can't show you a better time.

1300
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:38,200
Maybe you can drop my call, yes I'm gonna be a star.

1301
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:43,200
Maybe you can drop my call, and maybe I love you.

1302
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:54,200
Maybe you can drop my call, yes I'm gonna be a star.

1303
01:45:54,200 --> 01:46:02,200
Maybe you can drop my call, and maybe I love you.

1304
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:09,200
Maybe you can drop my call, yes I'm gonna be a star.

1305
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:17,200
Maybe you can drop my call, and maybe I love you.

1306
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:21,200
I stole the girl and my prospects were good.

1307
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:25,200
But she said, it's me, I got someone to say.

1308
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:29,200
I can't no call, and it's bringing my heart.

1309
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:33,200
But I found a driver, and that's a star.

1310
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:38,200
Maybe you can drop my call, yes I'm gonna be a star.

1311
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:46,200
Maybe you can drop my call, and maybe I love you.

1312
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:53,200
Maybe you can be a star.

1313
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,200
Somehow I always thought that had to do with sex.

1314
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:59,200
It's just me or you know, I'm gonna try that tonight, baby.

1315
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,200
You can drive my car.

1316
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:05,200
Beatles on the Charlie episode 851, more Skype in a second,

1317
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:09,200
and stay tuned, keep updating the Dropbox, if let me know where I can reach you.

1318
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,200
GX2 will like this one for sure.

1319
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,200
Play your video.

1320
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,200
We were the suitcase.

1321
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,200
We'll live in the disco.

1322
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,200
I forget about the rap place.

1323
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,200
