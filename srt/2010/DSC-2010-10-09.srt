00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Delta Sierra Charlie eight four eight these snafu Saturday edition

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:42,480
I fall for law here, the law world. I need it money card. I had none. I fall for law here, the law world. I fall for law here, the law world.

3
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:52,120
I live my baby and it feels so bad and yes my face is for her. She's the best girl I've ever had.

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm all for law here, the law world. I fall for law world. I fall for law world.

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm all for you, I'm all for you, I'm all of you, it's just my gives.

6
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:35,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

8
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh man, it's been one of those days, it's crazy!

9
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,360
The clash, I fought the law in the law one on the daily source code episode 8-4-8 coming to you from the Hilltop Watch Tower.

10
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Crackpot Command Center is a snap-through Saturday edition, so we will eventually make your ears bleed.

11
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,240
Instead of kind of easing to everything, as I am multi-multi-tripple tasking today.

12
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
I am so sorry that I'm so late with the show, those of you in getmonation east,

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,160
and the United States of Europe, and even the Holy Land check it out on the chat room.

14
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,160
No one's in the chat.net.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,320
I'll tell you what I've been doing later on, but first was rolled out one of the Marcus Couch tunes he sent in from Captain Clothes.

16
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:43,520
I've been hanging around this channel for, I've been coming around this hotel so long.

17
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:54,960
I've been hanging around this channel for, I've been coming around this hotel for way too long.

18
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:04,480
I wish we were all dead, so burned, just hide it from me like watching TV.

19
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,960
If we just look a lot better, like to know I got to get out, but it's just so tight,

20
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:26,000
wait by the chains keep me in the room, this channel for, I've been pulling around this hotel too long.

21
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:37,920
I've been hanging around this channel for, I've been pulling around this hotel for way too long,

22
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
but I've got a trick.

23
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,640
Let's go.

24
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
Let's wear it for a little bit.

25
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,800
Let this girl that's on us to the ban and play

26
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,800
She says, We're a husband veteran, I've been lying right here on the floor.

27
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,920
Relaxing, this time he You've weighed a

28
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
But what is my money?

29
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Hated what I am, after the last rain and hit around

30
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
This town on the corner

31
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,920
I've been coming around this old town so long

32
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I've been hanging around this town on the corner

33
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I've been buying around this old town

34
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
For way too late

35
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I've been on the corner

36
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I've been buying around this old town

37
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
For way too late

38
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,920
I've been hanging around this town

39
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I've been calling around this old town

40
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I've been calling around this old town

41
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,920
For way too late

42
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,920
I've been waiting for way too late

43
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I've been waiting for way too late

44
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
I've been waiting for way too late

45
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Bring him back the art of radio

46
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
The way it used to be the way it should be

47
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
The way it's going to be in the future

48
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
This is the daily source code

49
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
We are on the Snapfru Saturday edition

50
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,920
I've got to tell you Marcus Couch saved my ass today

51
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I have absolutely no time to prep for the show

52
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Although what's great is all these Dropboxes

53
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Everyone's created

54
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Apparently what happens is you just update the Dropbox

55
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
And more shit falls into it

56
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
And I open it up and it's like

57
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Oh there it is already to load into the system

58
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Totally loving that

59
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
I really appreciate it

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
But of course it's going to benefit everybody

61
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Which is the cool thing about it

62
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
You put it together at your show

63
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
It's the source code for the chucklehead

64
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
No sometimes

65
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I don't know why

66
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm so talented

67
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Just seem so homeless

68
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
I ain't really sure

69
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm going to seem like a middle of a good child

70
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
But just a little bit more

71
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
In focus

72
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,920
But when she runs her arms around me

73
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I can't come out

74
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Ross of woman

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Cos I love my三-year girls

76
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Tell her I'm my father

77
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
I'll find no fucking drama

78
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
One more of the shit

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
You can talk.

80
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,920
She leads the road

81
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,920
She is your lead hit

82
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Every now and then I get down to the middle of the day I'll just stop

83
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
And as myself, the wild gonna come

84
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
It just seems so useless to have the word so hard

85
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,920
And nothing ever you seem to come from it

86
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Because I should know it's really

87
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,920
This is when you're lost by the moment I came to give the guy

88
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Look, it feels so good, it's all free, it's all right

89
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I know we never know, change our minds about it

90
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Yeah, you're welcome

91
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Yeah, it comes with me

92
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Yeah, she looks so right

93
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,920
She's a need to know

94
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Watch it all

95
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Every time it seems like another level more about myself I'll reach out

96
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Now I'm home, something

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Yeah, I just catch myself wondering

98
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
We were in about some silly things

99
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
No matter the nothing

100
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
And then she knows me that

101
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
She realized I'm gonna know I can't get it down

102
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm gonna feel so good, so free, it's all right

103
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I know we never know, change our minds about it

104
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Yeah, you're welcome

105
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Yeah, you're welcome

106
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah, she looks so right

107
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,920
She's a need to know

108
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Watch it all

109
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Yeah, you're welcome

110
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Little message from my buddy Ray on the Charlie

111
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
If you could send me the direct link to your Dropbox

112
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
That would be even better if you could share it with me

113
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,920
That way I can grab all those awesome tracks you've got on there

114
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,920
And of course the Ray on the Charlie for episode 848

115
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Wow, 848 episodes already

116
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Holy crap, have we been doing this for a couple of years?

117
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Am I just nuts?

118
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Oh man, it's a beautiful day here at the Hilltop Watch Tower

119
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Crackpot Command Center not a came trail in the sky

120
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Which is always good news

121
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Although last night we were in the hot tub

122
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
And I looked up and there they were middle of the night

123
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,920
1030 came trail in a way

124
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Oh, there you go

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Of course everyone's sick

126
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Yeah, this is what happens

127
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
But today it's nice we've got about 80 degrees

128
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
It's just fantastic

129
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,920
And because last night it was occupied doing other things

130
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
That's why I didn't get around to taping my episodes

131
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
For the big app show of course now I'm doing two

132
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,920
We've got the iPhone version and the Android version

133
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
And it's a lot of work

134
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I desperately need to get what do you call those?

135
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Yeah, an intern

136
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
I need to get an intern here to help

137
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Someone who can actually do Final Cut Pro

138
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
That's all I need

139
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Then I would free up 80% of my time if I just had that

140
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,920
So that's something that we need to put the word out for

141
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
If you know someone who can be

142
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
I'll pay him not very much

143
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
An intern in the Los Angeles area

144
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Near the Hollywood Hills

145
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
It would be highly appreciated

146
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
You have your food bars back

147
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Your snafu's back

148
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Everything on time

149
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
I'm a one-man band

150
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Rollin' out the tunes that you put together on eight, four, eight

151
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
The chuckle heads unite, bring him back radio

152
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
The art of it, the way it should be

153
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Worldwide and global

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,920
When it fathills out my life is still

155
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Trying to get up that

156
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Repeat healer of hope

157
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
For a destination

158
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Are you lost quickly when I knew I should

159
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
That the world was made up of this robberhood

160
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
A man

161
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,920
For whatever that means

162
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Into a crazy times

163
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
When a mind met

164
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Is you getting all that

165
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
What's in mind

166
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
In a

167
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
I am feeling

168
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,920
A little peculiar

169
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
In so a way

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Keep the loneliness about sight

171
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
And I take a difficult

172
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
Then I can't feel high

173
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
And I dream from the top of my lungs

174
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
What's going on

175
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Are you lost quickly when I knew I should

176
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,920
That the world was made up of this robberhood

177
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
A man

178
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
For a destination

179
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Are you lost quickly when I knew I should

180
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
That the world was made up of this robberhood

181
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
A man

182
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
For whatever that means

183
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
I'll be alone

184
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I'll be alone

185
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
I'll be alone

186
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I'll be alone

187
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
And I dream from the bottom

188
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:25,920

193
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,920
for non-blans, what's going on?

194
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:48,600
FORZ ..

195
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,980
It was a totally love track, just a nice first afternoon Saturday.

196
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,480
so one of the interesting things here with the setup is that my PFF, my pre-fader-лosing interface just

197
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,680
Get the shit, so it's very hard to listen to tracks outside of the broadcast, but under my best.

198
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,240
Still be able to keep the show rolling.

199
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,600
Take you a little bit to the higher ground.

200
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,480
But keep the show rolling.

201
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Keep the show rolling.

202
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Keep the show rolling.

203
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Keep the show rolling.

204
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,480
I'm so done.

205
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I didn't like the slide again.

206
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Because my last time on it, my leather hole looks same.

207
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm so glad that I know my leather hole.

208
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
They're gonna keep the show rolling.

209
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Keep the show rolling.

210
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Keep your show rolling.

211
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Keep the show rolling.

212
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Keep the show rolling.

213
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Keep the show rolling.

214
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Moving again.

215
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Let's keep on turning around

216
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Doesn't find me to run

217
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I'll love

218
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Love us

219
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Keep on loving

220
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Believe us

221
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Keep on being even

222
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Just started sleeping

223
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,480
presque but not comfortable

224
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
From what I've got to say

225
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,480
And so I'm dreaming and not trying to look dead

226
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Just finished I'm about to try and noticed

227
00:19:48,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Oh, this is really...

228
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
This is bugging me.

229
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I think I'm gonna have to do some intro reconfiguration here for a second.

230
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Yeah, and that's what I thought would have.

231
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I hope for you that fix something.

232
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Let me just double check.

233
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Yeah, totally did it.

234
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Just a little resample on the audio interface.

235
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
That's all it takes.

236
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Yeah, that's one of those things.

237
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Just a little resample on the audio interface.

238
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Yeah, once you got that done, then you're all cool.

239
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
It's a daily source code.

240
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
We are totally situation normal all fucked up.

241
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,480
It's how we roll, setting resample rates in real time.

242
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,480
If you are listening to us on the Norwegian-Destream and Norwegian-Destream.com,

243
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,480
where you need to be, is in the chat room.

244
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,480
At Norwegian-Dachat.net, join the party.

245
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Talk with the friend of mine.

246
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I was in a car crash, it wasn't the war,

247
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,480
but I never been quite the same.

248
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Little while less like I was there.

249
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:58,480
You've been watching humans trying to get around.

250
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,480
You've been watching humans trying to get around.

251
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,480
You've been watching humans trying to get around.

252
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Oh look, there's a red machine.

253
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,480
I don't outside if it looked the other way.

254
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Wouldn't believe the things they do.

255
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I don't know.

256
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't know.

257
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,480
I don't know.

258
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I don't know.

259
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I don't know.

260
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:19,480
I don't know.

261
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I don't know.

262
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:34,480
I don't know.

263
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I don't know.

264
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I don't know.

265
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't know.

266
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,480
I don't know.

267
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:14,480
I don't know.

268
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I don't know why I didn't figure this one out before, man.

269
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Really, the way to do this is Dropbox.

270
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
That is just so outrageously cool.

271
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
I just get a shared Dropbox.

272
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
I opened it up.

273
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
It's there.

274
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,480
The songs appear magically when they've been synchronized with my computer.

275
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,480
And then I just drag them into my playout system and then they're gone so I know that

276
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
I've played them.

277
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
It's like freaking amazing.

278
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
I love this.

279
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
From now on, Dropbox is the way to go.

280
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
I've even signed up and I pay for an account man.

281
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
This shit is just totally out of control.

282
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,480
I'll have my own stuff more under control in about 15 minutes to be able to really focus

283
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
on the show.

284
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
I just got to get these episodes out.

285
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,480
One of them's rendered for Android, so I'll be putting that up in the iPhone.

286
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
And then I'm going to make your airs bleed.

287
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Airs bleed, I promise you.

288
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
You know why?

289
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
It's not even my airs to bleed.

290
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
You need to roll out some cowbell today as well.

291
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
It's the doors and they want that.

292
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
It's the doors and they want that.

293
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
It's the doors and they want that.

294
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
It's the doors and they want that.

295
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
It's the doors and they want that.

296
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
It's the doors and they want that.

297
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
It's the doors and they want that.

298
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
It's the doors and they want that.

299
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
It's the doors and they want that.

300
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
It's the doors and they want that.

301
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
It's the doors and they want that.

302
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
It's the doors and they want that.

303
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
It's the doors and they want that.

304
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
It's the doors and they want that.

305
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
It's the doors and they want that.

306
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
It's the doors and they want that.

307
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,480
It's the doors and they want that.

308
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
It's the doors and they want that.

309
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
It's the doors and they want that.

310
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
It's the doors and they want that.

311
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
It's the doors and they want that.

312
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,480
It's the doors and they want that.

313
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
It's the doors and they want that.

314
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
It's the doors and they want that.

315
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
It's the door and they want that.

316
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
It's the doors and they want that.

317
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
It's the doors and they want that.

318
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,480
It's the doors and they want that.

319
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,880
It's the doors and they want that.

320
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,520
It's the doors and they want that.

321
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:43,520
You're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a

322
00:26:43,520 --> 00:27:13,520
woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're an, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, or you are a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman, you're a woman

323
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:42,480
I see your hair is burning.

324
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Heels are filled with fire.

325
00:27:49,480 --> 00:28:03,480
If they say I never loved you, you know they are alive.

326
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,480
And now you'll free away.

327
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Midnight now is Rome.

328
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,480
I've seen cars that taples past, never so warm.

329
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:32,480
So alone, so alone, so alone, so alone, so alone.

330
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,480
No gentleman ain't better madness.

331
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,480
So chain a move, fly at the center.

332
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Midnight now is Rome.

333
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Midnight now is Rome.

334
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Midnight now is Rome.

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Midnight now is Rome.

336
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Midnight now is Rome.

337
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Midnight now is Rome.

338
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Midnight now is Rome.

339
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Midnight now is Rome.

340
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Midnight now is Rome.

341
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Midnight now is Rome.

342
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Midnight now is Rome.

343
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Midnight now is Rome.

344
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,480
I, you are looking in the middle of the city of L.E.

345
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,480
I got another note in your room.

346
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
It is now.

347
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,480
It is night.

348
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,480
It is night.

349
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
It is night.

350
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Wow.

351
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Help.

352
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:41,480
I, you are looking in the middle of the city of L.E.

353
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I, you are looking in the middle of the city of L.E.

354
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
It is kind of cool, right?

355
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Since when did you hear that one on the radio last?

356
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I mean, certainly in that version.

357
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Like that long extended version.

358
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
The doors, Jim Morrison, dude.

359
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
That guy was super freaking cool.

360
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,480
LA woman here on the daily source code episode 848.

361
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Of course, they have got a nice chat room filled with all the chuckle heads.

362
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
They are hanging out various parts of the world.

363
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
I do apologize for being so late.

364
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,480
I know a lot of people are going to have to check out and get monation east.

365
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,480
And in the United States of Europe, it is just a little bit too late.

366
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,480
But I will get to the Ray on the Charlie and as well to come extra blogger who has

367
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
something waiting in the wings.

368
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Because it has been a crazy two weeks.

369
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,480
It is kind of the last time since we spoke with each other.

370
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Because I have been heads down.

371
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Building, releasing the big app show for Android, which out of the gate is a phenomenal

372
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
success.

373
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,480
I am pretty amazed at the Android app community.

374
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
At least the Apple Hallics.

375
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
I had no idea.

376
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,480
I mean, every single episode, thousands of accesses.

377
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Of course, a lot of these apps are free, which makes it even better.

378
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Alright, this one should probably get me through to where I need to be and get in this

379
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
crap for least.

380
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
It is traffic.

381
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Low spark of high hill boy.

382
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:35,480
If you see something, it looks like the storm.

383
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,480
And it's shooting up out of the ground.

384
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:49,480
And your head is spinning from a loud guitar.

385
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,480
And you just can't escape from the sound.

386
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Don't worry too much.

387
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,480
It will happen to you.

388
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,480
We want your young ones playing with toys.

389
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

390
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:28,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

391
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,480
The percentage of playing is the new high price.

392
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,480
While you're living beyond all your means.

393
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,480
And the money in the suit has just bought a new car.

394
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,480
From the pocket he's made on your green.

395
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,480
But today you can swear that the men are shocked.

396
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,480
I've got nothing to make any noise.

397
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,480
But it was on the board at the lighting to rest.

398
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Was the loss of the high hill boy.

399
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,480
And you just can't escape from the sound.

400
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

401
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

402
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

403
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

404
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

405
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

406
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

407
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

408
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

409
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,480
And nothing like your hearing is only the sound.

410
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Would you ask for something like another chance?

411
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Or something similar as this?

412
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you.

413
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,480
And stars, your sorrows, your youth.

414
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,480
And nothing will not be spared to you.

415
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,480
And all you sound are the last part of the high hill boy.

416
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,480
The person said, job playing against the high price.

417
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,480
While you're living beyond all your means.

418
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,480
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car.

419
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,480
From the top of these made on your wings.

420
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,480
But today you can square that the name is shot down.

421
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,480
But the lock in the lake ain't nice.

422
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,480
But it wasn't the boy.

423
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:25,480
The lady to rest was the last part of high hill boy.

424
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Higher boys.

425
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Higher boys.

426
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Higher boys.
