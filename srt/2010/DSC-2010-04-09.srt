Last night, at the Golden God's Award, I'll talk to you guys that later on.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Gotta make a check at the pool and a foreign store in the chat room.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,120
I mean, this place is great for what?

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,160
No agenda.com is where you can join in the party and of course, no agenda stream.com.

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,280
We've blasted to your live every footballer's flighting.

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,680
From the hilltop, watch tower, pack my command center.

We're landing in California.

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,280
I must be worried to be able to say,

92
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm a day like I'm dead.

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,560
I've met a group to me on a fire.

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm the sunlight of tears.

95
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,160
When I'm out to get out of the corner,

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,040
I'm going to get out of the corner.

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,120
It's been me my good night and never hurt.

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,760
Oh, it's over, I can't believe it.

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,440
I've set my meals, kids, don't worry.

100
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,560
It's not that much, I'm going to play it guitars a day.

101
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
When I'm out to get out of the corner,

102
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm going to get out of the corner.

103
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm going to get out of the corner.

104
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm going to get out of the corner.

105
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm going to get out of the corner.

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm going to get out of the corner.

107
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,880
I'm going to get out of the corner.

108
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm going to act like I'm getting out of the corner.

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm going up to get out of the corner.

110
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:25,400
Oh man, I gotta tell you, I'm loving life here in Southern California, Lenny Gravitz, put it to words and music just perfectly.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:32,400
It is quick and time, everybody, it is Friday, it is the 9th of April 2010.

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,400
It's the football Friday, the show that's about everything, and then again it's about completely nothing.

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Just about having a party on your iPod, your iPhone, your Android, G-Phone, or maybe a blackberry, or just on your computer at work.

114
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Why you might even be addressing for people live somewhere?

115
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Drink it out, turn it on.

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Something we used to call radio, and now it's live in no genderstream.com.

117
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

121
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I want to shake the whole thing

122
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Look at it on the one to three

123
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I never be, I never tell

124
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,400
No, I don't play for me

125
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
It's not time, it's time

126
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
It's so filled with love

127
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm going to win it for all I want to do

128
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I can't see the time

129
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Turn up the radio

130
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I can't hear the music, it needs to move

131
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Turn up the radio

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,400

133
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Turn up the radio

134
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I want to be in a counterkill and so on

135
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Turn up the radio

136
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I need a new music, it needs to move

137
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,400

138
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,400

Let's get the official pronunciation right

141
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
It's off the graph

142
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Turn up the radio

143
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the show

144
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
By sending in tracks

145
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Marcus got your assistant very last minute

146
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I'll see if I can work that way

147
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I got so much music lined up for today's show

148
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
It's unbelievable

149
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
And some old friends returning to the show

150
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
And of course all this is brought to you

151
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
By the sustaining producers of the knowledge of the stream

152
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
At no origin of stream.com you can find them all listed there

153
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I'll talk about that later

154
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,400
But of course first we have to celebrate the fact that is the end of the week

155
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,400
One, two, three

156
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Come out and turn it off

157
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
It's great and tight

158
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Let's go home, screw the buzz

159
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:12,400

Just as to the song, present and famous

164
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I've got this on and now to talk

165
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I've been like a silver thread

166
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I've been summoning beauty in love

167
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I've been as was her name

168
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
She's got it

169
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Your baby, she's got it

00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
No, I'm your Venus

171
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm your fire at your desire

172
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm your Venus

173
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm your fire at your desire

174
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:30,400
When this were a crystal eyes

175
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Making everything else mad

176
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Black is the dark in the night

177
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,400
She was going no one else had

178
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
She's got it

179
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Your baby, she's got it

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm your Venus

181
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm your fire at your desire

182
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm your Venus

183
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I'm your fire at your desire

184
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm your Venus

185
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm your fire at your desire

186
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm your Venus

187
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm your fire at your desire

188
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm your Searl

189
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm your Venus

190
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm your fire at your desire

191
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm your fire at your desire

192
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm your Searl

193
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm your Venus

194
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm your fire at your desire

195
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I'm your fire at your desire

196
00:14:45,400 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh yeah, I've got to get that out of my system.

197
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:20,360
Now we had a great light last night going to golden gods awards at the Nokia LA Live theater

198
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,640
by invitation of my good friend Rudy Sarzo had seen and we actually figured it out 20 years

199
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,360
Christina wasn't even born the last time we saw each other. Of course we talked about Rudy a couple

200
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,280
years ago on the daily source code when he released his book off the rails about his life on the road

201
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,040
with with Randy Rhodes and the book is still selling it's say you can check I think it's a Rudy

202
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,360
Sarzo dot com anyway hooked us up got us some passes into the event I haven't had a laminated

203
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,360
all area access pass in many years my friends it was good one of those again and it was great there

204
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,000
were so many people there who I who I remembered recognized and they actually remembered me

205
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,440
see Alice Cooper was there running James Dio just tons tons of awesome talent of course it was one of

206
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:16,520
those TV shows that was not done live to tape or or broadcast live so the show itself and it

207
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,480
looked great on television I'm sure but it really sucks when you got like guys all cranked up and ready

208
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,840
to go you got slash on stage and he's bringing people out and then they have to wait for the cameras

209
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,200
to reset and just all the energy gets sucked out of the room I'm pretty sure they're going to have

210
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,160
to put in crowd shots of people being very happy because there was a lot of like what what's going on

211
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,280
but backstage was was where it was really happening and the best part of it all is they had

212
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:51,640
goody bags from hustler yeah interesting stuff in the goody bag I'll say hey welcome back a good

213
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,440
friend of the Charlie who didn't even know we were back on the air he's done tons of stuff

214
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,680
in the past years he's from the Netherlands and his name is Raymond we call him Ray for short

215
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,840
and he put together a little ditty to celebrate the return of the Charlie onto the airwaves

216
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:19,320
oh wait a minute hello yeah come on in come in juicy hi is this the deadly source code

217
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:39,480

218
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:47,480
welcome back welcome back hey Adam it's nice to hear you again the source code I must say

219
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,480
I really miss you man so first of all congratulations with your new born you and I'm glad

220
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,920
everything worked out fine for you and your loved ones like I said before life is too short to

221
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,040
not leave the life you want to live no we'll know the crossroads of the life unless they dare to take

222
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:17,800
the exit so it's a new spring it's a new life and I'm feeling good okay before I start

223
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:25,560
new episode of Ray on the Charlie I've got to admit something let me think okay actually I'm not

224
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,720
that good in English really thanks for all the chocolates I'm from the Netherlands and English is not

225
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,840
my mother language so I kind of do a lot of prep before I can record a new Ray on the Charlie

226
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,480
I actually got to write this scripts and use some Google translations before I can build these

227
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,800
episodes let me tell you a little story before I was allowed to do my English exam when I was in

228
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:55,480
high school back in 1990 I had to score a 9 I think that's an 8 in America but I had to score a 9

229
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,240
on my English to do the actual exam something I've never could have done without okay still the essay

230
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,360
out of my teacher's office well that's out of my system I remembered after the test I went into

231
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,160
the teacher's office to check the results of the test and the teacher was sitting behind his

232
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,960
desk and told me I scored a one a D and I thought to myself 13 possible why is this man

233
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,560
messing with my test I knew already I made one mistake on purpose so it would not stand

234
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,880
in afterwards he called me into his office and told me I scored a 9 and I could go to the exam

235
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:42,040
he was only testing me I can ask oh anyway you've opened up Adam found that you're new you

236
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,280
you're new life and a lovely girlfriend and I failed to answer your openness with this little

237
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,360
confession from my best so a new start of the source code I've thrilled and excited but I first got

238
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,280
some catching up to do I'm listening for the last five hours to the last five episodes of the Charlie

239
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,720
I really have to pay more attention and monitor my Twitter because then I had known you started

240
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:14,840

I'm a lot to do I'm a lot to do I'm a lot to do I'm a lot to do

247
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:33,000

248
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it.

249
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:08,960
Come by and I give you two precise, this is my last reaction, come by and I give you two, next, come by and, come by and I give you three sides, okay three sides, ultra-decisball, this is my last reaction,

250
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Come on, man, Digest Molly really knows how to mess up doesn't he? Digest Molly, root boy, resort, you can find links to that track and all the other songs played on the Charlie and the show notes of DailySourceCoat.com.

251
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:48,560
Well, we bring the art of old school radio back to your iPod, your iPhone, whatever the hell you use and differences make. That's the beauty of it.

252
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,160
It works everywhere. Soon you'll just turn on your car radio. It would be like, oh, there it is. It's stream and no agenda stream.com.

253
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:21,160
I'm pretty excited to tell you, Monday, the, the creamy as we call her, the shvarkenheimer, but it owners my daughter will be coming over for two weeks, so I'm going to pick her up at the airport. Unfortunately, because I booked this ticket for her, I think in October, October, November. She has to fly in the San Francisco, so I'm going to go to San Francisco, pick her up, bring her into Los Angeles.

254
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:34,160
And I think she's going to have a pretty good time. I am praying, of course, for good weather. I can just imagine her sitting here with the clouds going overhead and saying, why does all the bad stuff always have to happen to me?

255
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,160
That's going to be great. Maybe I'll get her on their show. She used to come on the source code for time to time.

256
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,160
It's this pod save, it's the lingus in the morning sun.

257
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:19,160
In the morning sun, I rolled a fat blood just to wake me up. Sometimes I find it hard to understand the way it can.

258
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:33,160
From your point of view, you'll find this true, and you'll just throw your eyes, but in your mind you'll see, it's not all that she thought it was.

259
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Because I wonder what I can sometimes every time you come around and tell me all the things you do.

260
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:45,160
The things that change out the ways you're present to us, they'd say that message is not yet true.

261
00:25:45,160 --> 00:26:09,160
And the morning sun, I rolled a fat blood just to wake me up. Sometimes I find it hard to understand the way it can.

262
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Because I wonder what I can sometimes every time you come around and tell me all the things you do.

263
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:24,160
The things that change out the ways you're present to us, they'd say that message is not yet true.

264
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Because I wonder what I can sometimes every time you come around and tell me all the things you do.

265
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,160
The things that change out the ways you're present to us, they'd say that message is not yet true.

266
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:47,160
From the positive music network, these days known as musicalley.com, the link is in the morning sun here on the football Friday for the resource code episode 827 plus funny last night.

267
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,160
We were hanging out at that golden god's award show.

268
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,160
And I could feel like some eyes in the back of my neck and then Mickey said, I think this guy wants to talk to you and turn around.

269
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:07,160
And this is a big rocker, he's got the leather zone, he's got his tats, he's got a really long hair and a couple of guys.

270
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Actually, I'd seen these guys around.

271
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,160
I don't really recognize him. Oh, maybe I do him, not sure.

272
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:21,160
And the guy says, and by the way, I get the sweetest handshake from him just like really soft and he's like, hey man, I'm Jesse from rock sugar.

273
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Like, oh, I love you guys.

274
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Of course, they do live mashups and I'm still waiting for their CD to arrive in the mail.

275
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I tried playing a couple of their tracks off of the YouTube clips, but it just sucks too bad on the stream, there's no quality.

276
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,160
So it was great, you know, it was really, I love the fact that I'd played him on the source code, but maybe two weeks ago.

277
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,160
And you hook up the world as vast, but in a way, it's kind of small and I really like that.

278
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:58,160
And it's basically, it's the magic of the internet, it brings us all together.

279
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Now this one was submitted to adamaccurry.com.

280
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,160
It's, uh, I think it's fun, save everything they have in Album yet.

281
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I like it, I find dragons, don't you?

282
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Don't you, don't you want to party?

283
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Leave all the bullshit at the time.

284
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Don't you, don't you want to party?

285
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Drink up, so you don't have to think I know.

286
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,160
You're just falling in your door.

287
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,160
We open half our time, running around for you, my mind.

288
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
We spend the other time.

289
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,160
We've added that some rain just to get flat by.

290
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Just to get back.

291
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Don't you, don't you want to be famous?

292
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Right things like you don't even care.

293
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Don't you, don't you want to be famous?

294
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:22,160
And everywhere you go, have everybody stop and stand by now.

295
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:30,160
We open half our time, running around for you, my mind.

296
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
We spend the other time.

297
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,160
We've added that some rain just to get back.

298
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Just to get back.

299
00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Don't you, don't you want to know with things?

300
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,160
And see if that's a matter of the harsh?

301
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Don't you, don't you want to know with things?

302
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:26,160
With every word you say, you tell it to people's words that are not born.

303
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:35,160
You say, no way, no time to stop.

304
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,160
We open half our time, running around for you, my mind.

305
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,160
We spend the other time.

306
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,160
We've added that some rain just to get flat by.

307
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:55,160
We've added that some rain just to get back.

308
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Just to get back.

309
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Just to get back.

310
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
I like it.

311
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I find dragons.

312
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Don't you want to party?

313
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
I believe it's pot safe.

314
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Although maybe not officially listen on the pot safe, using that word.

315
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
I dig it.

316
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Very nice.

317
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,160
So we have an official celebrity in the chat room.

318
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,160
A lot of you, of course, listen to the show on your iPod or some other portable device.

319
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:41,160
It says it wasn't tended originally when we put this podcasting thing together.

320
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,160
What's kind of new though is the idea of putting, or for me, at least, it's not new and general.

321
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Producing the show live, putting it on the stream.

322
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
We got a lot of shows running at noagendastream.com.

323
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Of course, the noagenda show that I do with John C. Dvorak tomorrow morning.

324
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,160
In the morning, we'll do another, I'm sorry, Sunday morning.

325
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,160
We'll do another early service edition.

326
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Then there's the Dvorak Horowitz unplugged show.

327
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
There's a daily source code.

328
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
We're looking for a couple more.

329
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
And we're slowly building it up.

330
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,160
It is nice to see that at any given moment, it's actually going up a little bit.

331
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,160
There's probably about, I'd say 90 people listening to the stream, which doesn't seem like a lot.

332
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,160
But when you take any consideration that they can listen live, you can just check in, sample it wherever you are.

333
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Or if you want to get any of those shows as a podcast, it's cool.

334
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,160
But the live part, for some reason I really like it.

335
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
I'm a radio guy.

336
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,160
I've been a DJ really all my life.

337
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
I've been anything.

338
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
It's that.

339
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
And we used to have something called, what was it?

340
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Oh, yeah, telephone.

341
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,160
And people would call up during the show.

342
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,160
And they'd say, hey, I do a man play this song for me.

343
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,160
And now I've got people in this chatroom from around the world.

344
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,160
And I'm watching him talk with each other and

345
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
yapping back and forth.

346
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
And it's all live.

347
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,160
And I'm getting actual, not just interesting info and feedback, but in pulses.

348
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,160
And in the chatroom today is, someone who I've never met, only virtually speaking,

349
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Bobby Eden, who is a well-known porn star.

350
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,160
And I say that with the utmost respect and humility.

351
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Because you know me and porn.

352
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
I encourage it.

353
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
I think it's absolutely awesome.

354
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
And she checked it.

355
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:35,160
It's awesome to have a diverse crowd checking in at noaginachat.com.

356
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Time to break it down.

357
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,160
This is kind of where, you know, if you're getting ready to go out, you might want to start getting dressed

358
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,160
and stand in front of the mirror, check yourself out.

359
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Kind of get into the swing of things.

360
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,160
For me, it's perfect here in the sunshine of Southern California.

361
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Exactly that cool breeze is kind of blowing up from the valley.

362
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
It's beautiful.

363
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Chicago beginnings.

364
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:13,160
When I was with you, it doesn't matter where we are.

365
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Oh, and when you're in, I'm with you, that's all that matters.

366
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Time passes much too quickly.

367
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:35,160
When we're together laughing, I wish I could sing it to you.

368
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Oh, no, I wish I could sing it to you.

369
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

370
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:40,160
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, if I ask you, if I ask you, if I ask you, if I ask you, I ask you for

371
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,160
We've been trying to sign which one

372
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I should try to put him to earth

373
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Oh no, you can try to put him to earth

374
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Oh no, no, no, no, no

375
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:11,160
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

376
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,160
It must be our facility

377
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Sun..

378
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:50,280
Oh

379
00:36:50,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Yeah, that's all that I'm thinking

380
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Oh, what I want to feel better

381
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

382
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Oh, that's just a stop, yeah

383
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I got to get you in a matter of power

384
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Got to get you next to me

385
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

386
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Oh, that's just a stop

387
00:37:48,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, that's funny

388
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Mickey's outside there

389
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Enjoying the sun and she's listening to the show

390
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
I'm from Noah gender

391
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I think a pocket Noah gender

392
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I phone app is like

393
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Hey, say hi to Bobby for me

394
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
I'm practicing

395
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,280
I think Bobby's coming to Los Angeles and the summer

396
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Definitely get her on the show

397
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Talk to her about her life

398
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

399
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

400
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

401
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

402
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

403
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

404
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Yeah, that's just a stop

405
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

406
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Yeah, that I'm thinking

407
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Oh, that I'm thinking

408
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

409
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

410
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

411
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

412
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

413
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

414
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:46,280
How do you love me, Jimmy?

415
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,280
For those of you who are near to the show, you're kind of slowly getting back into the swing of things.

416
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,280
We talk about technology, we talk about stuff going on in my life.

417
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,280
We talk about things from outer space.

418
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
There's been a lot of activity in that room lately.

419
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,280
On Fridays, we do the Fubar Friday edition, which is basically just a bunch of good music,

420
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,280
meant to lift your spirits, make you feel good about life.

421
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:22,280
And I tell you, when I hear this from Chicago, which Ray hooked me up with,

422
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,280
it's the seven-minute version of the beginning.

423
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,280
I can't wait for my shit to get here from London.

424
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:40,280
I miss my cowbell along with my compressors, my limitters, my disorders, my mixer.

425
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Hell, I'm even waiting for my nickname to show up, you know, like right,

426
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,280
motorcycle, trophies, my t-shirts, my uniform that I wore in a rack.

427
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,280
But it's been weird without my stuff, but the cowbell.

428
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,280
That's really the one I'm waiting for the most.

429
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Imagine what I could do with this.

430
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,280

435
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Here's a guy who I used to play a lot of back in the day.

436
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Jersey Todd sent me a couple of his tracks just to remind me of him.

437
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,280
And I think we'll get Jersey Todd back on the show soon enough.

438
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
So why you?

439
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Were the great message getting out live with all the little things?

440
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Please, Tom, I'm a boy as he serves up such songs.

441
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
You gotta see it, man.

442
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,280
And boy, you're Jimmy, but Jack, with your doing a cash beer with being rich.

443
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,280
So go with Southern Rock.

444
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,280
He plays guitar like he comes his hair, so smooth.

445
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
He's the dog in the band.

446
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
May I see him, man.

447
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Get him.

448
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Get out the house out in the street.

449
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I need to tag you though.

450
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
Get off, catch him.

451
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I need all life for style.

452
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
I'm not like you leave him.

453
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
That made him bad.

454
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Just wake him even.

455
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Live a little.

456
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Love a lot.

457
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Come on, come on, get out.

458
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
Live a little.

459
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Live a little.

460
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
Live a little.

461
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Live a little.

462
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Live a little.

463
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Live a little.

464
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
Live a little.

465
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Live a little.

466
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Live a little.

467
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Live a little.

468
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
Live a little.

469
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Live a little.

470
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Live a little.

471
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Live a little.

472
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
Live a little.

473
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Live a little.

474
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Live a little.

475
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Live a little.

476
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Live a little.

477
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Live a little.

478
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Live a little.

479
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Live a little.

480
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Live a little.

481
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Live a little.

482
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Live a little.

483
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
Live a little.

484
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Live a little.

485
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Live a little.

486
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Live a little.

487
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Love a lot.

488
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Come on, come on, get out.

489
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,280
Live a little.

490
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Get out and walk and roll for you in the rocking chair

491
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,280
99% of life is

492
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Yep, just be there

493
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Yep, I won't hide my memory

494
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Give it all

495
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Get out

496
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Get out of the house,!)

497
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
You're selling the street on your divorce

498
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Get off the couch, get off the line

499
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,280
If you don't like post out

500
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,180
1991, but I can leave it

501
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,280
You might've been alive

502
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,280
Just make it even easier

503
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
We don't have the same speed

504
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,280
I need to tell you

505
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,280
Get off the couch

506
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
Get off my pillow night

507
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
First hell

508
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Just laugh it about just waiting

509
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Even live a little

510
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
But right

511
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
Take a little chance

512
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
Don't let you go

513
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
I love the lyrics

514
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,280
Get off the line

515
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
Get off the line

516
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Feel like you

517
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah

518
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
Grab it

519
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Let it blow

520
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
Love it like

521
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
And

522
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
I just wanted to mention

523
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
I got another celebrity in

524
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
In the chat room

525
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
Angie B

526
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
The sexy soul treat

527
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Tulsa tones of Angie B

528
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
It was nice this

529
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Yeah, so many people say

530
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh, why don't you do video

531
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
And turn on the webcam

532
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Like no way

533
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
I want you guys to be

534
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Imagine where I am right now

535
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
In my hilltop

536
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Watch Tower

537
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,280
Crackpot Command Center

538
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,280
I want you to be imagining

539
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,280
People are in the chat room

540
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,280
And all they've got is words

541
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,280
They don't see anything

542
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
And they're talking to each other

543
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
And they're talking to each other

544
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
And they're imagining

545
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
What their own environments are like

546
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
And this theater of the mind

547
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
It's you know

548
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
You can read a book

549
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
That might be a good idea

550
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
From time to time

551
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
I encourage it highly

552
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
But also this type of

553
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,280
Just imagination

554
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
It does actually

555
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Help fire

556
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Synapses in your brain

557
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
It does something to you

558
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
And you will feel much better for it

559
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
And

560
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,280
Seeing as

561
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,280
The chat is such an important part

562
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
These live shows

563
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
I encourage everybody to bring a couple

564
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Friends in

565
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,280
It's really easy to hop on

566
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,280
As you go to

567
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Actually, if you go to

568
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
No agenda chat.com

569
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
But you can get to it

570
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,280
From other places

571
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
Well

572
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,280
And

573
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Bobby Eden, please

574
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,280
Feel free to bring some

575
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Your friends next time as well

576
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Well

577
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
The light's

578
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Now

579
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,280
I am an

580
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,280
And you can't stop

581
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
I am an

582
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
And I can't stop

583
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Don't know what I want

584
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
But I know how to get it

585
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I want to destroy

586
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I'll survive

587
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,280
Wanna play

588
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Yeah

589
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,280
And I can

590
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Now

591
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Don't

592
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,280
But

593
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,280
And I can't

594
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Farther

595
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
You can't

596
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
Yeah

597
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,280
It's coming some time

598
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
I'm an

599
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
I can't

600
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
I can't stop

601
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,280
Trafficking

602
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
I can't

603
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Traffling

604
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,440
As I've been

605
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,840
I can't

606
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,280
Fly

607
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Wanna play

608
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,280
Yeah

609
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,280
And I can't

610
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Yeah

611
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
Yeah

612
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Yeah

613
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Yeah

614
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
Yeah

615
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,280
And I can't

616
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,280
Yeah

617
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
I can't

618
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,280
Fly

619
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,280
I can't

620
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Keep

621
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,280
You

622
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
I can't

623
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,280
Fly

624
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:30,280
I'm running wasted, go watch everyone

625
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,280
I has the best prize of rest

626
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,280
I miss the enemy, I miss

627
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,280
And I can't survive

628
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,280
I'm running wasted, go watch everyone

629
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,280
I have the best prize of rest

630
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,280
I miss the enemy, I miss

631
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:05,280
And I can't survive

632
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,280
I miss the enemy

633
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,280
And I can't survive

634
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,280
I miss the enemy, I miss the enemy

635
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,280
I miss the enemy

636
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,280
I have the best prize of rest

637
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,280
I miss the enemy

638
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,280
I miss the enemy

639
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,720
And now that comes out and I'd say

640
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,560
I wanna play

641
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,160
Yeah, I wanna play

642
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:59,000
And I wanna play

643
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,680
Yeah, I wanna play

644
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,120
I have a game in the UK, sex pistols

645
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,160
I'm the football fried, not only a very appropriate for a fried edition of the chuck

646
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,520
But also because we lost a great one yesterday

647
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,760
Manager, legendary manager of the sex pistols

648
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,640
Malcolm McLaren, passed away, it was 64

649
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,640
I don't think anyone really knew how ill he was

650
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:34,440
And to me, it came as a shock, you know, like 64 crap man, that's young, that sucks.

651
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:42,880
And of course, he was legendary in the London scene, he lived with Vivian Westwood.

652
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,920
I started a lot of the amazing fashion trends in the 70s, and he will be missed not just

653
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,720
for the work that he's done, but for who he was.

654
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:01,720
And luckily, he does leave legacy behind, and he lives on in his own, by carousely through

655
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,320
songs like this from the Sex Pistol.

656
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,320
So, Rest in Peace, Malcolm McLaren.

657
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:20,720
They say good fences, make good neighbors, for you, my friend, this might be true.

658
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:26,720
But you still gotta play, boys, I'm a little too slow, I'm sorry.

659
00:50:50,720 --> 00:51:02,120
Sayin' hello to my little friend, Alan and Gary, I'm a very source call.

660
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:32,060
I got that TV in the corner, and that's their greatest dream, and I'm a little

661
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,060
slow.

662
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:49,060
They poison your mind, my child, with their fear and their guilt and the wounds.

663
00:51:49,060 --> 00:52:01,060
They teach you that you're just a number, as they program you in school.

664
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:15,060
So, by the time you're out in the world on your own, you've been trained not to buy

665
00:52:45,060 --> 00:53:03,060
your own, you've been trained not to buy your own, you've been trained not to buy

666
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:10,060
your own, you've been trained not to buy your own, you've been trained not to buy

667
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:25,060
