Think you're gonna lose my mind if I don't find something you can't find.

259
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:43,380
Can you wait for you for my brain?

517
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:19,800
I remember we played that one a lot on the headbangers ball, till of course with name

518
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
stream and then I was laying.

519
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
We couldn't play anymore.

520
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,820
I played the mors that's come daily source code, you have to sew numbers 852 in

521
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,220
KTKP track, it's the footballer Friday for November 19th, 2010.

522
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,260
Oh man, I was pulling up good old fashioned MTV memories last night, Mickey and I went

523
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
to an art exhibition.

524
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,420
It's an amazing guy, Robby, you know, sure come in and she'll tell me his name in a minute.

525
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:49,660
It goes like this amazing political stuff, the guy's in his 70s, he has just, I'm going

526
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:56,780
to post a picture somewhere, I was just really phenomenal, he had Clinton, he had big octopus

527
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:05,360
with all the bankers, I mean it's a combination of pictures and oil paints and I saw my

528
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,900
old buddy Dave Latic there who I'd not seen in almost 20 years who used to produce it to MTV

529
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:17,300
and it was just like, oh man, holy crap, how small the world really is, you know what I'm

530
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,500
saying?

531
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,620
Stick down the level for just a second, but not for too long, because as you know, I do

532
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:31,620
have to make ears bleak before the day is over, I think you best, I'm the Charlie.

533
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:42,380
Let's put it in a high gear, take it out for a drive, sometimes I feel the fear of

534
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:54,540
uncertainty, just getting clear, and I can't help but ask myself how much I let the fear

535
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:08,140
take through it as clear, it's even me before it seems that I'm a bad, haunting mass

536
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:21,780
of fear, but lately I'm getting a violent eyes to go on behind the wheel, whatever

537
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:34,780
tomorrow brings out me there, with all the arms and open eyes here, whatever tomorrow brings

538
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:49,220
out me there, I'll be there, so if I decide to wait for my chance to be one of the

539
00:46:49,220 --> 00:47:05,940
men, will I keep the water overwine in hold my own and drive, I know, just for me before

540
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:17,420
it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around, they leave, I get in the

541
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:24,340
way, I get in the way, I get in the way, I get in the way, I get in the way, I get in the

542
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:33,020

545
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:15,020

546
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:26,020

548
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:36,020

00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,020
I'll be there

550
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:11,020
You are too drunk to remember

551
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:17,020
All the stupid things you said

552
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:23,020
You said you would turn out famous

553
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,020
All those drugs went too young

554
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,020
When you were young

555
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,020
You were a wise guy

556
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:52,020
You thought you knew everything

557
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:58,020
When I ever went young

558
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:03,020

559
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,020

For the reason I've heard

you know it's exactly a show like this and a song like that for ministry the proves that radio formats for radio stations are bogus because we've got an audience that is incredibly

642
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,600
I'm looking at all of the songs coming in on the Dropbox.

643
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,600
It's outrageous what you guys put in there sometimes.

644
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,600
And I'm playing the tunes.

645
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,600
It's like I could just see everyone living along with it.

646
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,600
And they're cool if we really really throw down with some ministry.

647
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,600
And of course, I'll need to play some disco in a little bit too.

648
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,600
So you got on your run.

649
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,600
That's a place you had nothing to say.

650
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
Do your friends.

651
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,600
The never for your birthday.

652
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,600
You got up and took control of the situation.

653
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,600
Not then he wants you back without a national nation.

654
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,600
You change your style.

655
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,600
You change your hair.

656
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,600
You're cheese.

657
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,600
You got to tell your stupid smile.

658
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,600
You're fighting saying anything.

659
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,600
I don't think you're not better.

660
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,600
It's the fun that.

661
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,600
You are not what they hear.

662
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,600
You know that I'm a man.

663
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
My daughters.

664
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
This is the situation.

665
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
This is your wish for me.

666
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,600
This is the situation.

667
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,600
This is the situation.

668
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,600
This is the situation.

669
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
This is the situation.

670
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
This is the situation.

671
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
This is the situation.

672
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
This is the situation.

673
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:46,600
Where you hide when they act with a bat from your workstation

674
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Use the baseball bat and now it's in the litigation

675
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,600
What you should up cool up and walk the waiters by your tip

676
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,600
That's just calling you from January to December

677
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,600
You let it slide, you play the cool and that's your cause

678
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,600
But you're not even worth the time, but I think you know this

679
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,600
You can have all the ball that I want to take with you

680
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:35,600
But you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're

681
01:01:35,600 --> 01:02:05,600
not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth far enough time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think your not even worth the time, but if you're not even worth the time, but I think me that you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're not even worth the time, but I think you're

682
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:11,600
But when she sees you, for another, she does a lot of all.

683
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
You can't be found.

684
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:36,600

Thank you, Jones.

728
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
I can't go back and see it's me

729
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,600
In the morning

730
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,600
I kicked the lyrics so hard people can see the reeds

731
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,600
Stop the man, be a mixed, damn see

732
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,600
Let's go, jump, a tick, give like Jackie Chan, many crock moves

733
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,600
I can't be by the backsman, black man, leave body backs to a man

734
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,600
Cut the two like a gun, press the trigger

735
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,600
I'll set the shabby, put the aix, put the squad

736
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,600
To add some common good, the powerful squad

737
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
You pick it, you pick it, you pick it, play it, do the fight

738
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
I gotta step, to check, get hit, like the Beastie boys

739
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,600
I'll record your happy and track the Beastie, they flat, man, a steak

740
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Have a change, rap, rap, and food, and go

741
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,600
I'll make the fight, put it on the window

742
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,600
If I keep trying, pulling the squad, what up?

743
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,600
I'll stay the champion, gotta to go like the first one

744
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,600
We've got to breathe, man, action, get a go

745
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,600
It's the devil, go, you gotta check, get the devil, go

749
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:43,460

750
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:48,460
Nice, the glittering, really crumbling, no, oh, look up, let's see what you're trying to do.

751
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,460
Beep, yeah, make a band, you keep foot, go, I can't just work like the cat, metal cat.

752
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,460
Look at the brain, the brain, the past is the past, like give me food, like me through my cracker bang.

753
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,460
I'm like the million ears, make a mole and say, what a fucking devil's door.

754
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,460
Look, you never know, you gotta check, check the devil's door.

755
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:10,460
So if you feel a door, help the devil go, run, run, run.

756
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:17,460
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

757
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,460
And look around, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

758
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,460
And look around, come on, come on.

759
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,460
And look around, just stay so cocky.

760
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:28,460
I never think these guys really quite got the recognition they deserve.

761
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:34,460
Outside of the Netherlands that is, get monation lowlands, these guys are our Dutch urban dance squad.

762
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,460
It's the Demogog.

763
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:41,220
God and they know they had a little bit of traction there. I think somewhere in the 90s and then all of a sudden

764
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,700
Just kind of went away. They are really kick-ass

765
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:48,060
Well, we dropped that in the box. Thank you so much. It's highly appreciate it

766
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,780
The source code back to the 80s with the besties

767
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:09,960
We've been on TV and they have to talk to me. We're just going out just like the great game

768
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,460
And I've always had a look at what I've heard about

769
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,960
I'm the one that goes on and drag it to the crib

770
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,540
I'm feeling a feeling I make a little bit of my daughter

771
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,220
To the parade units

772
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,040
Enjoy Christmas

773
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,000
Didter of Eli, that you know that I never did

774
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,960
The lady is the lady.

775
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,960
Well, me, hit the corner with the girl.

776
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,960
Look at that.

777
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,960
I just like you.

778
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,960
Well, the next time.

779
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,960
We just got nothing wrong.

780
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,960
Just got a cut, not a copy.

781
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,960
We're about to blow it.

782
01:13:58,960 --> 01:13:59,960
Back the way.

783
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:00,960
Life in the cat.

784
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,960
This could give that a hell.

785
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,960
And that girl ain't nothing but a friend.

786
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,960
It's getting all stupid.

787
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,960
Yeah.

788
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
I want to say stupid.

789
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,960
I need stupid.

790
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,960
I don't shake that computer.

791
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,960
I charge it in charge.

792
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,960
I've had a matter about it.

793
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,960
Got to the door.

794
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:14,960
Why?

795
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,960
I just like you.

796
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,960
You want to say stupid.

797
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,960
I don't shake that computer.

798
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,960
I don't shake that computer.

799
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,960
I like the little money.

800
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,960
I like the little money.

801
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,960
But I can't pay the money.

802
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,960
I don't go for that.

803
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:24,960
I'm asking a rascal.

804
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,960
You've been listening to my mind.

805
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,960
You've been listening to my mind.

806
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,960
You've been listening to my mind.

807
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,960
Just stop.

808
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,960
Just stop.

809
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,960

810
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960

813
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,960
Just stop.

814
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,960
I got an open mouth.

815
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
You're my girl.

816
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,960
You're my girl.

817
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,960
That's always what lies my heart.

818
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:39,960
Hey lady.

819
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,960
Okay.

820
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,960
Hey.

821
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,960
Hey lady.

822
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:46,960
Hey.

823
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,960
Hey.

824
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,960
Hey lady.

825
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
I'm a tongue.

826
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Hey, I'm a tongue.

827
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,960
Hey.

828
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,960

829
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,960
Hey.

830
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,960
Hey.

831
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,960
Hey lady.

832
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,960
Hey, I'm a tongue.

833
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,960
You're my girl.

834
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,960
You're my girl.

835
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,960
You're your good time, as you try to go.

836
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,960
Work without you, and go.

837
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,960
You're my girl.

838
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,960
You're my girl.

839
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,800
Go lay in the pool of a night when I'm checking

840
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,000
And come with on the corner and you dare and it's sick

841
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
It's not coming over, it was pretty too bad

842
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,680
I still don't get close and I don't know how to go see

843
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,080
Don't let you lose when you went inside

844
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
You wish I'd walk in the back of your mouth

845
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,680
It's too thick, my bust and any rush

846
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,280
I can't rely like your mother is by your rear end

847
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,520
So jump back to tell it in the door

848
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,960
Walk up in the water with your water to the floor

849
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,120
I know, I like girls up now with the weight of pain

850
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,680
I've got a couple of eyes

851
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,680
Go and go and hang along and feed me

852
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,800
Just wear a spot, walk it up in the back of your mouth

853
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,200
Keeping your hands apart, you wouldn't want me

854
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,760
Ladies, okay

855
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:14,120
Go lay in the pool of a night and you dare and you dare and it's sick

856

970
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:16,120
I've got about to jump inside and rock the socks and things

971
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:28,120
I've got about to jump inside and rock the socks and things

972
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:44,120
I've got about to jump inside and rock the socks and things

973
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:56,120
I've got about to jump inside and rock the socks and things

974
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:06,120
I'm off the path

975
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:11,120
We play and give on nation lowlands. Yesterday everyone

976
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,120
From what I understand they threw one of his guitars in the audience

977
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,000
He got recieved by somebody and decided to move

978
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,120
When we tried to pop everything to play on things

979
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,120
I've got a box of chocolate set

980
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,120
I've got the sets of any good

981
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,120
I want to come out way

01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,120
Thank you very much to this next

983
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,120
that came from her dropbox

984
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,120
as I have to paraphrase

985
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,120
what I saw on the chat room

986
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,120
We love your box to this next

987
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,120
You've got to go on on, baby

988
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
This eyes

989
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,120
If you've ever been on a virgin landing flight

990
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,120
you've heard this play

991
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,120
incessantly as they're free boarding music

992
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,120
which is just wrong on so many different levels

993
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,120
Yeah

994
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,120
I've made the grain

995
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,120
on the Charlie 852

996
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,120
One man on the road

997
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,120
that the phone

998
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,120
one case

999
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,120
everything by the side

1000
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,120
Two eyes

1001
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,120
that go inside

1002
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,120
and show the girl

1003
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,120
Let's try to hide

1004
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:24,120
We've made the grain

1005
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:31,120
We've made the grain

1006
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,120
We've made the grain

1007
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,120
We've made the grain

1008
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:42,120
It takes time now

1009
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,120
We've made the grain

1010
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:24,120
So let me come and make you all glad

1011
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,120
Don't leave me, I'll keep you all the way

1012
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,120
So some of you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1013
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:35,120
We played your way

1014
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:41,120
We played your way

1015
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:46,120
We played your way

1016
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:51,120
We played your way

1017
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:56,120
We played your way

1018
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:00,120
We played your way

1019
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,120
Whoops, it looks like we had a little digital issue there

1020
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,120
Just a small bit of a file missing, sorry about it

1021
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,120
I'm not sure what happened there, besides Faith and Ray

1022
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,120
See we can get that one back on later

1023
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:21,120
Coming up, comic strip blogger

1024
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:26,120
With a report from at least three weeks ago

1025
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,120
But obviously still bad, look because it's got to get something off this chest

1026
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,120
As usual, he's pissed

1027
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,120
Stay tuned, it's coming up from the Charlie

1028
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,120
And stay till the contract

1029
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,120
Call the contract

1030
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:42,120
And now we're turning back

1031
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,120
The Charlie points are career

1032
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:52,120
The career begins in season

1033
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:57,120
The holiday, the fun fight

1034
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,120
The fun fight, the feeling is nice

1035
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,120
The fun weekend, the fun weekend

1036
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,120
All of a sudden, after all

1037
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,120
It's running out, running out

1038
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:17,120
All of a sudden, after all

1039
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:21,120
It's a competitive world

1040
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:26,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1041
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:42,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1042
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:49,120
The rum, all the warm, tough story

1043
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:53,120
I will know, sit here and down

1044
01:26:53,120 --> 01:27:01,120
See just how the lies have been seen in the long hours

1045
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:10,120
So this, taken in my sunset and the green

1046
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:15,120
The fun weekend, the fun weekend

1047
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,120
All of a sudden, after all

1048
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,120
It's running out, running out

1049
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:27,120
All of a sudden, after all

1050
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:31,120
It's a competitive world

1051
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:36,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1052
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1053
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:04,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1054
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,120
The crying hands, drug only care

1055
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:13,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1056
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:18,120
The crying hands, drug only care

1057
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,120
Everything counts in all your mouths

1058
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:43,080
I've known these guys since, oh my god, it must be since 1981, oh they all 50 now?

1059
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,040
That's unbelievable.

1060
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:49,040
Depeche mode, everything counts, especially in large amounts, you ain't that the truth.

1061
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:54,460
Now, I don't care what you girls say, I think size does matter, that's just the bottom

1062
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:55,460
line.

1063
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:59,840
Alright, everybody, as promised, here he is, and he's in the chat room, so you can

1064
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,180
talk about him there, and let's see what he has to say.

1065
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:13,920
Comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic strip, comic

1066
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,500
strip, comic strip, you're home, my European car correspondent friend?

1067
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:24,500
Hello, Adam, hello, daily, no agenda, not quite, we're getting there, see USB, not quite,

1068
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:30,220
here he is, he is, be reporting to your life from West Asia, also known as Europe.

1069
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,060
That's a good one, man, I like that.

1070
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:41,220
So, I am a part, I angry, good, because I thought that here in Eo Empire, we all agree

1071
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:49,340
on free market economy, but you know what just happens, Eo will be supporting Symbian.

1072
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:53,740
Oh, wait a minute, oh, wait a minute, yeah, you know, I should have talked about this

1073
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:58,580
on no agenda, it isn't, this is indeed a very weird one, coming from the country

1074
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:04,340
and the Starfleet Command, where Naly Cruz has successfully sued Microsoft, I think Google

1075
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:08,580
and probably will sue Apple eventually, they're doing some nasty shit, I agree.

1076
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:17,100
This is the 100% owned by Nokia operating system, and in total it is 20 to million, 11

1077
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,620
million first and then 11 million second phase.

1078
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:31,460
And they call it even S-Y-N-B-E-O-S-E initiative, which is a variation from Symbian, the embedded

1079
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,060
operating system for Europe are them.

1080
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:40,340
I know, I know, it's crazy, and it seems, what is the word anti-competitive?

1081
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,340
That's not good, don't you think?

1082
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,340
No, I don't think so.

1083
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:48,740
By the way, let's not confuse Symbian, which is the Nokia owned by operating system

1084
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:53,180
of this failing, will be based by Migo and L-B-W-W-W-W-W.

1085
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:57,100
Sounds like a true former employee, but I'm just saying.

1086
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:05,620
It's an Android and so on, and Symbian is a masturbation device for women.

1087
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:11,300
Yeah, I've seen this, in fact, I know a friend of mine made some of the videos for that.

1088
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,540
Oh, at 10, if you use 3 million, oh, at 10, sure.

1089
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,540
Yeah, have a like.

1090
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:18,980
Yo, let me ask you a question.

1091
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:19,980
Are you insane?

1092
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,780
Will you try to get crazy with a scene?

1093
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,580
Don't you know, I'm local?

1094
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:48,300
This is the one on the floor, I'm boy, you're 10, but just past that ham and the fry and pan, I swear.

1095
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,300
Done when I come in, I'm damn, I feel like this when I say.

1096
01:31:52,300 --> 01:32:22,300
Don't think me like shit, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1097
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:52,300
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1098
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,500

01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:24,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1113
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:28,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1114
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1115
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1116
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:36,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1117
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1118
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:40,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1119
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1120
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1121
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1122
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1123
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:49,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1124
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:51,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1125
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1126
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:54,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1127
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1128
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1129
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1130
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1131
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:05,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1132
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1133
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1134
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1135
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1136
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:15,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1137
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:17,820
I'm the king of rock and I'm the fire

1138
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:26,820
It's all I said we didn't know, didn't know, one chillout, it's not Michael Jackson

1139
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:32,820
And this is not true, it's one depth of love, I know I can hang, I'll never run the MC, they'll fool in the game

1140
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:38,820
Roll to the rock, rock to the road, DFC stands for doubt, they did my control, you can't touch me

1141
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:46,820
I'm CCoSp4, we're 10 foot-pot, and not even making avellowy so some sort, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff

1142
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:54,820
Now we crash the wall, puck the floor, spust, do ceiling I لو we're on the table, fresh out the block

1143
01:35:54,820 --> 01:36:03,060
If you could hit ICHOIAστov, block's a block, more any living fuel, brother Jenny speak a D!A C, 맛있는 tape, we're the big

1144
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:13,820
No, we're the baddest of the bad

1145
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,820
The only stuff to go up here, see I rockin' for

1146
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:17,820
If you're running around the room, it's not a trick

1147
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:19,820
A dream and it's not a April 4

1148
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,820
It's all brand new, never ever old

1149
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:33,820
You guys are new thing in your body, and you can't

1150
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,820
Cover head, when you're my coat

1151
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,820
And you're knees won't bend

1152
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,820
Music ain't nothing but a people jam

1153
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:41,820
It's good you got DMC, rockin' was not a bad

1154
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:48,820
Now I walk toward ice, and I will fell

1155
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,820
I've been my time in a push-on-tell

1156
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,820
I stood on many stages so many nights

1157
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,820
Take airplane flights, have you tried?

1158
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,820
Oh, you suck at MCs, you gotta say please

1159
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,820
Cause when it turns hard, I'm pulling down

1160
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:01,820
Wings get a storm so strong

1161
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:04,820
It's looking down trees, isn't hard to believe

1162
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,820
The only MCs

1163
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:19,820
I am from around the way, there are a school

1164
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,820
Every day, they take place, and they see us

1165
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:24,820
The play, and we get down, and throw the lay

1166
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,820
Hey, I like what's left, what's left

1167
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,820
What's that speed, everyone says to run

1168
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:31,820
That are you me, and they just break every day

1169
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,820
And the week, and we are the truth

1170
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:36,820
That can never be me, so don't try to get me

1171
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,820
Time to be my friend, thus if you do

1172
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:40,820
Do the draws in the air, the rock we say

1173
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,820
So send a train, because I've never seen a rat in what we say

1174
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:57,820
Every jam we play, we break two meals, this three of us

1175
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:00,820
But we're not so bills, my name is Darren

1176
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:02,820
You can go home, deal, you can go home

1177
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,820
Don't bother, you can call them DMC

1178
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,820
People always ask DMC, what does it mean?

1179
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:09,820
This will never dirty, and she will most declare

1180
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:22,820
Like we said before, we rock our car, I'll feed you run like a spray

1181
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:25,820
I've been here, you're drunk, and now we got some neck

1182
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:28,820
To attract our rhymes and apple, DZ Hat

1183
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:31,820
We'll raise on a grain and rock your neck

1184
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:34,820
To rock your middle, we got two BFC

1185
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,820
We got one at a take, let the promise pop

1186
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:39,820
And the breakers break, we're all cool cats

1187
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,820
It's like that, that's the way it is

1188
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:44,820
To get a help back, we're doing an hard time

1189
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,820
But so the MCs, because they don't make no sauce like these

1190
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:05,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1191
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:57,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1269
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1270
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1271
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:03,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1272
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1273
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1274
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:09,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1275
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:11,820
We're all cool cats

1276
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:13,820
We're all cool cats

1277
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,820
We're all cool cats

1278
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:33,820
We're all cool cats

1279
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:37,820
We're all cool cats, we're all cool cats

1280
01:42:37,820 --> 01:43:07,820

1282
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:41,820
I've got a pretty Boolean with a style and a use

1283
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:45,820
And I feel love from across the river

1284
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:49,820
It's just love in the bird's degree

1285
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:53,820
Oh baby baby, don't you?

1286
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:57,820
Turn your left mouth away

1287
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:01,820
Oh baby, hey, hey, hey

1288
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:07,820
We can say it, you only know the dance

1289
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:11,820
Love way

1290
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:19,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1291
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:23,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1292
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1293
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:29,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1294
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,820
It's just love in the moment you know

1295
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:37,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1296
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:41,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1297
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:45,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1298
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:49,820
I want it, love way

1299
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:53,820
Oh, I want it, love way

1300
01:44:53,820 --> 01:45:23,820

1302
01:45:53,260 --> 01:46:08,420
Oh yeah, back in the day with Diamond Davidly Raw, Van Haden dance tonight away, I'm my

1303
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:13,000
version through a Kiwi Christmas Drop box and it's time for us to share some music from

1304
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,920
children from my other land.

1305
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:24,920
I guess because there's really Kiwi music, let's check it out and enjoy it together on the track.

1306
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:32,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm better off my bike.

1307
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:39,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1308
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:46,920
You got something I want, let's reach it right in order to make it.

1309
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:59,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1310
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:06,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1311
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:13,920
You got something I want, let's reach it right in order to make it.

1312
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:27,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1313
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:34,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1314
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:40,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1315
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:48,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1316
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:53,920
You got something I want, let's reach it right in order to make it.

1317
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:03,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1318
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:12,920
You got something I want, let's reach it right in order to make it.

1319
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:22,920
I'm more than too proud of it, I'm gonna go straight to you.

1320
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:27,920
I say you, but I don't get it

1321
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,920
Don't get it, I love you, don't get it

1322
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,920
Come on now

1323
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,920
Can I still be the world?

1324
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,920
I'll fix it, let it run away

1325
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,920
Yeah, yeah

1326
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,920
All right

1327
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,920
We're not a kid in the world

1328
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,920
I dream like nobody's alive

1329
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,920
Bring it down for me, don't know

1330
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:14,920
Under the Friday, Kiwi Music courtesy of Kiwi Chris

1331
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,920
We have the system we set up with these draw boxes

1332
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,920
Really is quite amazing

1333
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,920
I saw a tweet come by the other day

1334
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:24,920
From one of the DJs on the big radio station in Gitmo Nation lowlands

1335
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,920
And you know there's all these different systems

1336
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:30,920
I'm using Ableton Live and a combination of cookie

1337
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:34,920
Wacked out cooked up shit that kind of works

1338
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,920
And is economical

1339
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,920
They use a very expensive system called Dullet

1340
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,920
You can Google that and look them up

1341
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,920
And their whole system crashed

1342
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,920
And the guy actually tweeted that he wished he had a drop box set up

1343
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,920
Like the Daily Source code

1344
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,920
And at least he could play some tunes

1345
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,920
And this is where we got going on and it's so beautiful

1346
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,920
Because without this system I never would have come across this track

1347
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,920
Oh there's nothing like a drop in the morning

1348
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,920
But there's nothing really like it in the world

1349
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,920
And I have outside of me

1350
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,920
Who will blow me every day

1351
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:38,920
But I'm always finally found my girl

1352
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:43,920
Oh there's nothing like a drop in morning

1353
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,920
And there's nothing really like it in the world

1354
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,920
And I have outside of me

1355
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:54,920
Who will blow me every day

1356
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:57,920
And I'm always find my girl

1357
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,920
Oh there's nothing like a drop in the morning

1358
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:07,920
And there's nothing really like it in the world

1359
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,920
And I have outside of me

1360
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,920
Who will blow me every day

1361
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:24,920
And I'll know when I am finally found my...

1362
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,920
In the morning

1363
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:27,920
Yeah sleep

1364
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:31,920
Please pack back good times

1365
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,920
Please go help sleep

1366
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,920
Please pack back good times

1367
01:52:44,920 --> 01:53:07,480
As you did, I hear it in, but time's right, all made you great, let's see if we can,

1368
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:37,480
I gotta go out and pretend, come to mind, let's all do it again, go into the world, you better let them have the door, go into the door, you already tell the girl, let's learn and tell the girl and fight, I don't want you to get this hard in life, go in life, it's up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Good day!

1371
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:11,480
The clock is there, why are there today?

1372
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:15,480
You see, we won't, you can't change your name

1373
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,480
Let's cast the red, I didn't know how to get together

1374
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:23,480
We won't forget, we won't set down today

1375
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:26,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1376
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:31,480
Can't hold the hatchet, and don't be a drag

1377
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,480
We won't forget, we won't set down today

1378
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:40,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1379
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:45,480
Can't hold the hatchet, and don't be a drag

1380
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:51,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1381
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:55,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1382
01:55:55,480 --> 01:56:01,480
Can't hold the hatchet, and don't be a drag

1383
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:30,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1384
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:35,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1385
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:40,480
Can't hold the hatchet, and don't be a drag

1386
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:48,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1387
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:53,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1388
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:59,480
Can't hold the hatchet, and don't be a drag

1389
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:03,480
Don't be a drag, party's the day

1390
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:08,480
Can't hold the hatchet, and don't be a drag

1391
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:13,480
I couldn't dance for another

1392
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,480
Your groove, I do deeply dig the walls

1393
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:19,480
Only the brain, my self-adish

1394
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:20,480
My fricatash wins

1395
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:24,480
The fricat's braided, I couldn't dance for another

1396
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:32,480
I couldn't dance for another

1397
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:52,480
Your groove, I do deeply dig the walls

1398
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:57,480
Only the brain, my self-adish

1399
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:01,480
Your groove, I do deeply dig the walls

1400
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:09,480
Watch out!

1401
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:44,480
What got to feel you blown alone?

1402
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,480
The life's so true, it's the life of life

1403
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,480
Making it be when it's special, yeah the show

1404
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,480
When I call a heart like a Hendrix easy

1405
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,480
Music makes music look like amazing

1406
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,480
All this kind of heart is special, you know?

1407
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,480
Of a rhythm that I want to be

1408
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,480
Come on, let's go with electric cars

1409
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,480
You get to the diabetes, you realize

1410
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,480
You really have to see the focus out of me

1411
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,480
Baby you'll see them with a music mirror

1412
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:06,480
You get rid of it, you get to think of it

1413

You play a part, fight, fight, follow the street

02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:20,240
And that's pretty cool!

1530
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:25,240
History repeating for peda heads and Shirley Bassie on your daily source code.

1531
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:29,240
Hey man, the human resource is getting a little bit off of you there in the chat room.

1532
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:33,240
And you guys kind of lost when you started talking about Windows 7 versus Max.

1533
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,240
So I just kind of went on my own little bit.

1534
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,240
I have to go!

1535
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:39,240

designed, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design and the design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, it's my design, I got my design, ita your design

1582
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:25,240
Let's just go, fire in the total hall.

1583
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:30,240
I already got it, man.

1584
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,240
Once you guys all stop traveling by air

1585
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:38,240
because you don't want to be broke by the TSA, sexual things

1586
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:40,240
or snap naked by your government.

1587
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:43,240
You're going to be loving a baby source code like this

1588
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:46,240
as you have to drive from coast to coast

1589
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:48,240
because you know the trains all suck.

1590
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:51,240
You're high voltage, fire in the disco, fire in the Taco Bell.

1591
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:53,240
The rhythm's horrible.

1592
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:56,240
Without a pull, it's a lowering, my level.

1593
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:57,240
The hard rumble.

1594
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:58,240
We're your level winner, man.

1595
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:59,240
You are stalling.

1596
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:01,240
You know a stomach in tea.

1597
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:03,240
They're gonna meet telling you the hear it.

1598
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:04,240
They praise the music.

1599
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:05,240
Just having to play the lyrics.

1600
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:07,240
Some say no to the album for sure.

1601
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:09,240
But what's the sound?

1602
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:10,240
I made a miracle.

1603
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,240
I guess you know.

1604
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:12,240
You guess I'm just a radical.

1605
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:14,240
None else I've had a pull.

1606
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,240
Yes to make it to the cool.

1607
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:16,240
The only part of your body.

1608
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:17,240
Two different body and two.

1609
02:19:17,240 --> 02:19:19,240
Have the power on an hour from the river.

1610
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:20,240
Are you?

1611
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:21,240
Hey, you're just man.

1612
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:22,240
I don't understand.

1613
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,240
It's man.

1614
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:24,240
Yo, you got your slow down.

1615
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:25,240
Make a loser though.

1616
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:26,240
Radio.

1617
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,240
Suckin' never play me.

1618
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:28,240
All the links.

1619
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,240
They just don't keep me now.

1620
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:30,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1621
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:32,240
When it clocking, my soul is no sneaking and taking.

1622
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,240
Everything.

1623
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:35,240
Never feel the old heart.

1624
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,240
My quartercard.

1625
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:37,240
Recording it all.

1626
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:38,240
Support.

1627
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,240
I'm just a more loud and proud.

1628
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:40,240
Kickin' live.

1629
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:41,240
Next floor.

1630
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:42,240
It's a pretty new for you.

1631
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:43,240
But super.

1632
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:44,240
Just eating.

1633
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:46,240
A rebel.

1634
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:47,240
It is no mine.

1635
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:48,240
Support.

1636
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:49,240
I'm around.

1637
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,240
It's hard to scan our line.

1638
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:51,240
Oh, suck it.

1639
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:52,240
The claim I do crime.

1640
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,240
They're on my top ticket.

1641
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:54,240
Hey, yo, yo.

1642
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,240
I think we take this short show.

1643
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:58,240
This is the only thing I've made for more.

1644
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:59,240
Can't you turn it in the end.

1645
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:00,240
Talk.

1646
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:01,240
Talk.

1647
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:02,240
Talk.

1648
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:03,240
Talk.

1649
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:04,240
Talk.

1650
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:05,240
Talk.

1651
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:07,240
Talk.

1652
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:08,240
Talk.

1653
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:09,240
Talk.

1654
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:10,240
Talk.

1655
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:11,240
Talk.

1656
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:12,240
Talk.

1657
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:13,240
Talk.

1658
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:14,240
Talk.

1659
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:15,240
Can't you turn up unless it can't help on this?

1660
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:17,240
They call the breakdown.

1661
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:18,240
Bomber rebel, it's vinyl.

1662
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:22,240
Unlike final soul, rain for oh, come on like a rhino.

1663
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:23,240
Tape cold turn.

1664
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,240
wattings burn the learned.

1665
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:27,200
They get disabled, the power of my label.

1666
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:29,240
They're jam to世.

1667
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:30,240
Just who I am, they enemy's public.

1668
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:32,240
They are li DI1ВTAM.

1669
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:34,240
Strainy Leiswear, guide the rally.

1670
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:35,240
That's the reason.

1671
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:36,240
They can't clear enough.

1672
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:37,240
The following.

1673
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:38,240
Never signin' no.

1674
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,240
Don't pin the note claimin'

1675
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,240
We're gettin' out rhythm from.

1676
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:42,240
No moroni.

1677
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:45,240
Number one, we're here today, we give you some, no gun.

1678
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:48,040
It's still never gonna run, you wanna be an F1,

1679
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:50,440
give a tell you win, and then you come again,

1680
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,640
you know what time it is, if he's the president,

1681
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:55,040
pullin' out already gun, zapped the next one,

1682
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:58,640
I could be a show gun, don't let the men in,

1683
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:03,640
solve this rule, I ain't rid it, hard to rock ball like a razor,

1684
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:05,840
I'm like a laser, I just won't face up,

1685
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:08,240
old enough the razor, so this will face up,

1686
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,640
get it right, throw it, maybe I will face up,

1687
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,840
playin' the rule, I got soul to,

1688
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:16,240
voice my opinion, with ball you smooth,

1689
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:18,640
not what I am, rock,

1690
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:21,640
cause I'm a man, no matter what the name,

1691
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:25,640
we're all the same, pieces, and one big chance game,

1692
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:28,640
but for it's all power, is in a house,

1693
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:31,240
go take a shower boy, heat it up too,

1694
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:34,640
I'll chew, not sing along, we wear black regulars,

1695
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:37,240
we're at Stangeless, you can't handle us,

1696
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:40,240
I know you're listening, I put your fist in your pants,

1697
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,040
you're scared of this enough,

1698
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:44,440
the crowd is listening, we're all the same,

1699
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:46,640

1700
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:48,640
Yo you got a money, yeah,

Roll it, burn, put some D's, sell it, run it, bro

And all my breaks I'm playing in that softbox ball, Reel, don't think it's cork scoosh, your light is in your mat

1716

Books, damn it got enough, but I hope water to save the fucking greener

1717
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:40,040
Just on the arrowhead, every on his park, let's call his shoulder, pull and springs

1718
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:44,040
Keep my lips so wet, girl, I can't let you bring on more than four

1719
02:23:44,040 --> 02:23:48,040
ounces, unless you want to show me how you're fat

1720
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:52,040
Pretty boozey, we confiscate, to lick it, because you know they pose a threat

1721
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:55,040
I'll even confiscate, you pussy if I make it through

1722
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:58,040
Damn I hate to see that breast milk go the way

Yo, I think this iPhone could be you, as a weapon, take it for the days they're piled

Let me open that ass like Maria full of grass you go we don't think you should

1738
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:05,400
We're being you tainted in a lot. He tried to time me on the plane

1739
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:06,840
I'm for you in a month

1740
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:10,840
Yes, we I've got my girls some Chanel number five lady

1741

Please in five minutes and you're running late. I'm so fucking sorry play. I get your ass back in life

1743
02:26:18,480 --> 02:26:20,720

1744
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:24,920
We don't walk the money clip. Going keys wallet purse. What's a piece?

1745
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:26,720
I'll be running through

1746
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:31,520
We don't walk the money clip. Going keys wallet purse. What's a piece?

1747
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:33,720
I'll be running through

1748
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:35,720
Yes, hey, you got us

1749
02:26:35,720 --> 02:26:36,720
We don't think

1750
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:38,720
We're saying gangsters

1751
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,720
We're saying gangsters

1752
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:41,720
We're saying gangsters

1753
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,720
We're saying gangsters

1754
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:44,720
We're saying gangsters

1755
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:45,720
We're saying gangsters

1756
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:46,720
We're saying gangsters

1757
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,720
I love that shit man

1758
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:50,720
Love the fucker

1759
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:53,720
Yeah, there's nothing like a little bit of TSA gangsters

1760
02:26:55,720 --> 02:27:00,720
Man, I love it when these guys put that shit together. It's awesome. Let's play that other one. I played the other day on

1761
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:04,720
Just before no agenda on the pre-stream it's the song a day number six eight four

1762
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:06,720
Last time

1763
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:08,720
But fucking

1764
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:11,720
YouTube with your damn pre-rolls

1765
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:20,720
I guess this guy makes a song every single day, which is kind of cool as I talk all the way through the commercial

1766
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:22,720
Okay, here we go

1767
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:24,720
I don't like the TSA as a title

1768
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:27,720
I don't like the TSA

1769
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:32,720
I don't see how they keep me safe

1770
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:36,720
This can't even bear it's way

1771
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:42,720
Then laughing me when I'm at my gate

1772
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:46,720
And if I refuse to show them my penis

1773
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:48,720
And they all just don't rob me

1774
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,720
God don't rob me

1775
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:54,720
And if I refuse then rob them

1776
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,720
Me then they'll treat me like it'd be tainy

1777
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,720
And be tainy

1778
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,720
I think it'd be tainy

1779
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:04,720
All right, so I would like to TSA

1780
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:08,720
TSA can my shoes off don't keep me safe

1781
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:14,720
Face can't even bear it's way

1782
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:18,720
For they grow me which is not okay

1783
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:24,720
Don't look at me wrong

1784
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:28,720
This isn't about the ages

1785
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:32,720
They're just too big jobs

1786
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:36,720
This isn't about the policy

1787
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,720
And the company is the property

1788
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:42,720
And that question is to save the abonement

1789
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:45,720
With X-ray, maybe the government says

1790
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,720
We're in quite so accurate

1791
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:50,720
They say that this is 0.02

1792
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:52,720
Like the seabirds but how much

1793
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:55,720
Is deposit in a scan

1794
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:59,720
And that's why I like to TSA

1795
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:04,720
I don't see how they keep me safe

1796
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:08,720
They can scan me with their X-ray

1797
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:13,720
And they're laughing at me when I'm at my gate

1798
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:18,720
I don't like TSA

1799
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:22,720
I don't see how they get my shoes off

1800
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,720
Keep in me safe

1801
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:28,720
I don't know why they got to use that great big X-ray

1802
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:30,720
And then they're laughing

1803
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,720
They're going

1804
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:36,720
All the way down

1805
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,720
The corridor

1806
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,720
Yeah from the stuff

1807
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,720
From song a day

1808
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:44,720
That is

1809
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,720
What was it song a day number 684

1810
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:48,720
I don't like the TSA

1811
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:49,720
That's kind of good

1812
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:52,720
I should check out the rest of this stuff

1813
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,720
Now I was just thinking

1814
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:59,720
I didn't have a chance on Thursdays

1815
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:02,720
No agenda to really play all of the clips I had

1816
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:04,720
Because I watched C-SPAN

1817
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,720
So you don't have to

1818
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:08,720
And I was just a couple things

1819
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:13,720
There's this director of the Transportation Security Administration

1820
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:16,720
And he's such a liar

1821
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:18,720
Such an incredible liar

1822
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:22,720
And I think we spend an hour talking about this stuff

1823
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,720
There's a couple of the clips that just wanted to share with you

1824
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:27,720
Some of the, well let's get to the lying part

1825
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:28,720
Right right off the bat

1826
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:30,720
And someone actually sent me a note and said

1827
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:32,720
You can tell when this guy is lying

1828
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:34,720
Because he really gives you that

1829
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:35,720
It's a spook

1830
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:36,720
He's a former FBI guy

1831
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,720
A friend of Obama by the way

1832
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,720
And I just would like to point out

1833
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:43,720
It's really nice that people like Molly Wood

1834
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:45,720
And I'll jump in on board

1835
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,720
Seeing that there's a lot of

1836
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:50,720
You know, cronyism going on here

1837
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:52,720
Of course, Michael Chirtoff

1838
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:56,720
Is a former Secretary of Homeland Security

1839
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:58,720
And he started

1840
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:00,720
Essentially calling for these

1841
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:02,720
Naked body scanners

1842
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:03,720
While he was still in office

1843
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:05,720
And now the Michael Chirtoff group

1844
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:07,720
Is a consultant to

1845
02:31:07,720 --> 02:31:09,720
Rappascan I believe

1846
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:10,720
Yeah, Rappascan

1847
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:14,720
But there's another actually I posted this on the curry.com

1848
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,720
Just to check the site for a second

1849
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,720
I'll read it to you verbatim

1850
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:21,720
And this is something we found out

1851
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:22,720
You'll really like this

1852
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:24,720
Oh, second

1853
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,720
So it's not just Michael Chirtoff and George Soros

1854
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,720
Who used their influence to obtain government contracts

1855
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:30,720
For the TSA Naked body scanners

1856
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:31,720
Deepak Chopra

1857
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:32,720
And by the way, that's not the

1858
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:34,720
Polistic Healing Guide Deepak Chopra

1859
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:38,720
He's the chairman of the CEO of OSI systems

1860
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:41,720
Who make Rappascan TSA Naked body scanners

1861
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:43,720
Actually was selected

1862
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:46,720
To accompany our president to Mumbai

1863
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:49,720
And attended the US India Business Entrepreneurship meeting

1864
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:51,720
Yeah, coincidence I think not

1865
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:54,720
Take this he also supported Obama during his presidential bid

1866
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:55,720
With the maximum amount

1867
02:31:55,720 --> 02:31:57,720
Who knows how many people inside his company

1868
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:59,720
He got to support the president

1869
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:03,720
And in this pistol guy he's also a good friend of Obama

1870
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:06,720
And now that just implementing all of these machines

1871
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:08,720
And you're going to have him everywhere

1872
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,720
So do they store images?

1873
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:14,720
We've instituted it and implemented it

1874
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:18,720
I should say a number of privacy protocols

1875
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,720
To ensure that those types of things you described

1876
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:21,720
Do not happen

1877
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:25,720
So for one the security officer who is viewing the image

1878
02:32:25,720 --> 02:32:27,720
Again, it's not a photograph, it's an image

1879
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:29,720
And even with the face blurred

1880
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:32,720
And what I've seen by the way on some of the news reports

1881
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:33,720
It's not accurate

1882
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:35,720
Some of these very graphic displays

1883
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:37,720
Are not what the security officer is seeing

1884
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:39,720
So I'm not sure where there's a photo shot

1885
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,720
You know the things that we've seen

1886
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:44,720
Are go to the airport

1887
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:47,720
You can actually see the pictures are posted on the sign

1888
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:49,720
It looks pretty graphic to me

1889
02:32:49,720 --> 02:32:51,720
I'm not sure where they're getting those

1890
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:53,720
But a little bit of more detail

1891
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:55,720
Quite a bit more actually on some of these

1892
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:58,720
So the officer who sees the image never sees a person

1893
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:01,720
The officer who sees a person never sees the image

1894
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,720
And the machines are specifically disabled

1895
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:06,720
The functions are disabled in terms of any retention

1896
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:08,720
Very important what he's saying there

1897
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:10,720
The functions are disabled in other words

1898
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:12,720
The functions are there

1899
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:14,720
But they may have like flipped a switch

1900
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:17,720
So it's disabled which means it could easily be enabled

1901
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:20,720
Unlike the actual tender they put out

1902
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:24,720
Which says they should not be able to store images at all

1903
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:27,720
But they've just been disabled temporarily for your convenience

1904
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:29,720
Slave

1905
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:31,720
Or ability to transmit those images

1906
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:35,720
And so the way in a core cell phone cameras

1907
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:38,720
Anything like that are not allowed in that screening room

1908
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:40,720
So we believe we've implemented

1909
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:44,720
We believe words matter so much with assholes like this

1910
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:47,720
Advocate privacy protections if you will

1911
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:51,720
That being said I'm also very interested in the next generation

1912
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:54,720
Of advanced imaging technology

1913
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:56,720
Which is the automated target recognition

1914
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:58,720
Which is basically a stick figure

1915
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:00,720
Or a blob if you will

1916
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,720
Two options

1917
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:04,720
Yeah, I got a blob right here pistol peat

1918
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:08,720
Where through automated target algorithms

1919
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:10,720
The anomaly where that may be on the body

1920
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:12,720
Was show up as a box if you will

1921
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:15,720
Like armpit and growing whatever may be

1922
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:17,720
Growing armpit

1923
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:19,720
Why does he say armpit

1924
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:21,720
You know

1925
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:25,720
I have it on good authority that there are some freaky sex

1926
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:28,720
Fiends out there

1927
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,720
There's an armpit fetish

1928
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:34,720
I know a very famous person actually who likes to hump armpits

1929
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:37,720
And then the pat down we'll just focus on that area

1930
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:39,720
So that is the next generation

1931
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,720
The only concern I have about that

1932
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:43,720
They're currently a high rate of false positives on that

1933
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:45,720
Technology so we're working through that

1934
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:46,720
But we are currently testing that

1935
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:48,720
Today we have been for several months

1936
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:50,720
It's a use in Skipple Airport in Amsterdam

1937
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:52,720
Bullshit

1938
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:54,720
Another bullshit lie

1939
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:56,720
It's not being used in Skipple Airport in Amsterdam

1940
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,720
Because they don't even have it for the overseas flights

1941
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:00,720
I've taken four and there was no scanner at all

1942
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:04,720
We with high rate of false positives that results in more pentounds

1943
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:06,720
So we're trying to stay away from that

1944
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:08,720
So let's talk about the pat downs then

1945
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:10,720
Come on pistol peat can't tell us about the pat downs

1946
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,720
What exactly the pat downs and tail

1947
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:15,720
And the standing is that the October change went

1948
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:17,720
From using the back of a hand

1949
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:19,720
Gliding across a person

1950
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,720
To a different approach

1951
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:23,720
You might describe that number one

1952
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:25,720
And what would it quite describe that if you would

1953
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,720
Yeah, we went for the back of the hand to

1954
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,720
Cup in my balls

1955
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:31,720
Back of the hand is still used in

1956
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,720
And in some aspects

1957
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:35,720
I would prefer not go into

1958
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:37,720
Specific detail

1959
02:35:37,720 --> 02:35:39,720
Oh, no, no, no

1960
02:35:39,720 --> 02:35:41,720
Of course, let's not go into any detail

1961
02:35:41,720 --> 02:35:43,720
Why not? Why not?

1962
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:44,720
Hearing

1963
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:45,720
Alright simply because I don't want to

1964
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:47,720
To give a road map to anybody

1965
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:51,720
Say, okay, here's exactly what their technique is

1966
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,720
The technique how hard is this

1967
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:57,720
How hard is it to tell us that you feel people

1968
02:35:57,720 --> 02:35:59,720
I mean it's like

1969
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:01,720
I don't want to give the terrorist

1970
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:03,720
You know that really smart and if they heard this

1971
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:07,720
They know you know they know how to hide stuff like in your asshole

1972
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:09,720
And so how can we defeat that

1973
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:13,720
We just seen the ingenuity, the creativity

1974
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:15,720
About kind of revenge

1975
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:17,720
Okay, I'll kind of an Arabian peninsula

1976
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:21,720
Like play that again. It's so creative

1977
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:23,720
They're so ingenious

1978
02:36:23,720 --> 02:36:25,720
The ingenuity of these guys is amazing

1979
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:27,720
The about kind of even

1980
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:29,720
Vanessa particularly with these last three attempts

1981
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:31,720
And so I'd be glad to go in there detail

1982
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:33,720
And obviously any member who is not

1983
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:35,720
Experienced at patdown would like to do that

1984
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:39,720
I would not have to do experience to

1985
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:43,720
Callified security officer would be glad to do that

1986
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:45,720
Come on over a congressman

1987
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:47,720
You want me to feel you up. Yeah, no problem

1988
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:49,720
All right now listen to the real scam

1989
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:57,720
This is two minutes. You got to listen to this. This is this is the actual scam that's taking place. So for all those listening in

1990
02:36:57,720 --> 02:36:59,720
That's use slaves

1991
02:36:59,720 --> 02:37:03,720
It's still going to be the same. It will be the intrusive patdown

1992
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:07,720
And it will be the event or the advanced imaging or the what advanced imaging?

1993
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:11,720
Oh, did he say already? I didn't understand

1994
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:13,720
be the intrusive patdown intrusive patdown

1995
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:17,720
That's the first time I've heard that word intrusive patdown

1996
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:21,720
Well intrusion means you're going into something doesn't it?

1997
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:25,720
And it will be the event or the advanced imaging already.

1998
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:26,720
Or both or both?

1999
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:29,720
They'll begin to be glad the option to top out of the IT

2000
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:31,720
In which case they would receive a thorough patdowns

2001
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:32,720
What would we say?

2002
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:33,720
Oh, there's a alarm

2003
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:35,720
The center hand which you healed on that point

2004
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,720
I think

2005
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:38,720
Oh, let's let's talk about that for a second

2006
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:43,720
The Mr. Pistol testified that the increased advanced technology

2007
02:37:43,720 --> 02:37:48,720
He hopes lead them to a point where the advanced imaging technology will give

2008
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:51,720
Stick figures rather than the above full body impressioners

2009
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:53,720
Stick figures

2010
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:57,720
Yeah, you know I used to draw stick figures in class and I got sent to the principles office

2011
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:00,720
That's correct. Yeah, that's the next generation that we're looking at

2012
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:03,720
Just again with high false positives that we've seen in our testing

2013
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:06,720
We're not there yet. How far away is that?

2014
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:08,720
I would like to say

2015
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:11,720
Months but again, it's all technology driven

2016
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:14,720
So there's a huge incentive as you can imagine

2017
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:17,720
To private businesses to to give this as

2018
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:22,720
Oh, there's incentive to private businesses like L3, Rappis scan

2019
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,720
Oh, incentives. What is the incentive?

2020
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,720
Let me think with that be

2021
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:27,720
Money

2022
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:28,720
Fast as they can

2023
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:30,720
Perfect. I like to say this portion of things

2024
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:31,720
Perfect in that regard

2025
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:33,720
So there's a huge incentive for them to do that

2026
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:36,720
And there's a number of companies that are competing to do that

2027
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:38,720
So we're working very closely

2028
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,720
If you go out to to Reagan Airport just south of the airport

2029
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:43,720
There's a transportation security integration facility

2030
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:46,720
Where we test all of our equipment before we deploy it

2031
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,720
And so I invite you to come out there and see what we're doing with

2032
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:52,720
The ATR, the advanced target recognition software

2033
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:56,720
The nice thing about that is from a budgetary standpoint

2034
02:38:56,720 --> 02:38:57,720
And just from a practicality

2035
02:38:57,720 --> 02:38:59,720
Here it comes, needs more money

2036
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:02,720
It's really a software modification to the existing hardware

2037
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,720
We don't need to buy any more expensive hardware

2038
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:06,720
Do you get some software and some really expensive software

2039
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:08,720
Maintenance, consultants, you can't track

2040
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:11,720
So we don't go out and buy all new hardware and things

2041
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:14,720
You can use your existing window, 7 machine, no problem

2042
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:16,720
Can be used in software modification

2043
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:17,720
So that's

2044
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:18,720
That's good

2045
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:19,720
It's good

2046
02:39:19,720 --> 02:39:21,720
I guess it takes you to a question a little more fully

2047
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:23,720
I see us in an interim period here right now

2048
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:27,720
Where we're using the best techniques and tactics

2049
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:28,720
Given the intelligence

2050
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:31,720
Enabled by the best technology

2051
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:34,720
My hope is that technology will improve

2052
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:36,720
Perhaps it's someday

2053
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,720
Not only do we have the stick figures

2054
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:41,720
People can walk through, they can take liquids through

2055
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:43,720
Again, they can keep shoes on, they don't have to take it

2056
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:44,720
Oh, that's great

2057
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:46,720
This is fantastic news

2058
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:48,720
We won't have to take any shoe

2059
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:49,720
He's saying it right here

2060
02:39:49,720 --> 02:39:52,720
You won't have to take shoes off, you can take liquids on board

2061
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,720
Go ahead, slaves, just walk through, get ready

2062
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,720
We're just looking at you, no problem, keep on walking through

2063
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,720
And we'll do this everywhere, every single place you want

2064
02:39:59,720 --> 02:40:01,720
You want to go supporting a man, you're going through the scanner

2065
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:02,720
You want to go to the school

2066
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:04,720
Hey, kid, kid, kids, slave kid, go through the scanner

2067
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:05,720
Let's go

2068
02:40:05,720 --> 02:40:06,720
Huh?

2069
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:08,720
Want to go to Whole Foods, want to get some food, go through the scanner

2070
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:10,720
The technology will improve

2071
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:11,720
Perhaps it's someday

2072
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:14,720
You know, not only do we have the stick figures

2073
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:16,720
People can walk through, they can take liquids through again

2074
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:19,720
They can keep shoes on, they don't have to take here

2075
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:22,720
Computers out there, they're briefcases and things like that

2076
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:23,720
Oh, really?

2077
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:25,720
Things that I would like to build too

2078
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:29,720
Recognizing the creativity of the terrace

2079
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:31,720
We've seen with the donor cartridges

2080
02:40:31,720 --> 02:40:33,720
And no one if they can put them there

2081
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:35,720
They can put in a lot of other places

2082
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:37,720
Yeah, right, like my A-hole

2083
02:40:37,720 --> 02:40:40,720
Oh man, it's the scam

2084
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:42,720
That's sound you hear

2085
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:45,720
Is the sound of money being sucked out of your wallet

2086
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:47,720
Right now it's young

2087
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:50,720
It's seen that life was so wonderful

2088
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:52,720
Oh, America!

2089
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:55,720
Oh, it is beautiful, magic thought

2090
02:40:55,720 --> 02:40:57,720
But don't look but in the tree

2091
02:40:57,720 --> 02:41:00,720
You'll never be singing so happily

2092
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:02,720
Oh, joyful be

2093
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:06,720
Oh, joyful be you watching me

2094
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:09,720
But then this is the only way

2095
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:12,720
Make me how to be sensible

2096
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:17,720
The logical, all responsible, practical

2097
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:20,720
But then they show me a world

2098
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:23,720
All I could be so deep in the world

2099
02:41:23,720 --> 02:41:29,720
All clinical, all intellectuals and equal

2100
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:36,720
There are times when I almost feel

2101
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:40,720
But where is the front of you?

2102
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:46,720
For such a sin for my life

2103
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:52,720
Won't you please please tell me what's the name

2104
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:56,720
I know it sounds absurd

2105
02:41:56,720 --> 02:42:02,720
Please tell me who I am

2106
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:08,720
I say no, what would you say?

2107
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:11,720
That be calling you a radical

2108
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:16,720
A lever on all the magical criminal

2109
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:18,720
Don't you sign a thing?

2110
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:21,720
We'd like to be your acceptable bond

2111
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:25,720
Respectable, all reasonable

2112
02:42:25,720 --> 02:42:26,720
I should go

2113
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:30,720
Oh, take it, take it, take it, go

2114
02:42:30,720 --> 02:42:33,720
Oh, take it, take it, go

2115
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:38,720
Oh, take it, go

2116
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:40,720
I don't know, what would you say?

2117
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:44,720
That be calling you a radical

2118
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:48,720
A lever on all the magical criminal

2119
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:49,720
Don't you sign a thing?

2120
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:52,720
We'd like to be your sweet

2121
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:55,720
But I don't want to see

2122
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:59,720
And then the west and the run so deep

2123
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:05,720
And then the sun goes in the fire

2124
02:43:05,720 --> 02:43:10,720
And the heat goes down the walls

2125
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:15,720
And the wind goes down the sun

2126
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:21,720
And then the dust goes down the fire

2127
02:43:21,720 --> 02:43:34,720
And then the wind goes down the fire

2128
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:40,720
And then the dust goes down the fire

2129
02:43:40,720 --> 02:43:46,720
And then the dust goes down the fire

2130
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:56,720
And then the dust goes down the fire

2131
02:43:56,720 --> 02:44:20,400
Oh my apologies, I got a little bit off track there, just had an unleash a little bit

2132
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:22,400
of fubar stingy my guess.

2133
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:29,400
Every digulous, no fault for the naked body scanners, no fault for the touch.

2134
02:44:29,400 --> 02:44:34,400
Actually, I'm looking through the drop box, I found the perfect song for the TSA.

2135
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,400
This is exactly right.

2136
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:41,400
Touch me, touch me, I want to feel your body, no matter what.

2137
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:43,400
Oh come on, Mr. TSA man.

2138
02:44:43,400 --> 02:44:53,400
You want to feel your body.

2139
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:58,400
Oh yeah oh yeah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah,

2140
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:03,400
Oh yeah oh yeah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:06,400
you're losing.

2142
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:08,400
For when in the city, you've never learnt of a beat from a boy.

2143
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:11,400
Oh yeah, убdering you.

2144
02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:16,400
I was hunting you now, and I was dying

2145
02:45:16,400 --> 02:45:21,400
When I saw you there, I didn't need you to hesitate

2146
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:25,400
This is the night sky, this is the night sky

2147
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:28,400
This is the night sky, this is the night sky

2148
02:45:28,400 --> 02:45:31,400
We've got to get back, this is the night sky

Such me, such me now

2152
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:48,400
We got to flash through this very soon tonight

2153
02:45:48,400 --> 02:45:53,400
Sit, I'll let you go, I did not treat you right

2154
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:57,400
You made me feel so good, made me feel myself

2155
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:02,400
No, I'm alone, no, somebody else

2156
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:07,400
This is the night sky, this is the night sky

2157
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:09,400
This is the night sky, this is the night sky

2158
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:12,400

02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:16,400
Such me, such me, I wanna feel your body

2160
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:20,400
Your heartbeat next to my

02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:25,400
Such me, such me now

02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:30,400

Such me, such me now

2164
02:46:37,400 --> 02:46:42,400
I'll let you go, I did not treat you right

2165
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:49,400
You made me feel so good, made me feel like you

2166
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:55,400
You made me feel so good, made me feel like you

2167
02:46:55,400 --> 02:47:02,500
You made me feel so good, made me feel so

2168
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:04,500
One in two

2169
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:11,500
Oh, what's wrong with you?

2170
02:47:12,500 --> 02:47:15,500
And she's the most touching touch me

2171
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:18,500
I want to feel your body

2172
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:22,500
Your heartbeat makes too bad

2173
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:27,500
This is how I want your body

2174
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:31,500
Oh, that's how

2175
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:34,500
Such me, such me

2176
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:36,500
I want to feel your body

2177
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:40,500
Your heartbeat makes too bad

2178
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:44,500
This is how I want your body

2179
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:46,500
Yes, indeed, glad to

2180
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:49,500
Samantha Fox is indeed now an official sister

2181
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:52,500
She actually came out of me for a while

2182
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:55,500
She was on the show right in Holland a lot

2183
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:56,500
I mean a lot

2184
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,500
She was kind of hot back there

2185
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:04,500
I want to suck her I am, I should have gone for it

2186
02:48:06,500 --> 02:48:10,500
Okay, one corona down, so Vanessa's must finna

2187
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:13,500
Let me see what the delay is on the chat room for a second here

2188
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:15,500
By the way, Captain Saber 2, thank you so much

2189
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:18,500
You've got an excellent dropbox man, I really love your box

2190
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:21,500
So everyone in chat room raise your hand for a second

2191
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:24,500
So I can kind of time the delay

2192
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:27,500
I'm going to say it's probably about 20 seconds

2193
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:30,500
There's a couple of things I want to talk with you guys about

2194
02:48:30,500 --> 02:48:34,500
But it kind of sucks that I have this master delay

2195
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:37,500
I wonder if I up the bit rate on the on the screen

2196
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:38,500
If that would make the delay

2197
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:40,500
Okay, that's not bad, sit us next

2198
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:42,500
Yeah, then now there is a little bit of a delay

2199
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:46,500
So when Chris the Chris when Kevin the blade gets here

2200
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:49,500
I have all this thanks guys hand raise

2201
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:51,500
And I have extra time

2202
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:54,500
I mean I'd be very willing to

2203
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:57,500
And open to doing you know really regular shows

2204
02:48:57,500 --> 02:49:02,500
And I'm thinking how can we do the same value for value that we do with no agenda

2205
02:49:02,500 --> 02:49:05,500
Because this is kind of thrown in for free I guess

2206
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:08,500
You know I don't think there's a you know there's no separate donation

2207
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:11,500
Spot for for the daily source code

2208
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:17,500
But how much would you would be willing to spend for a couple hours of enjoyment

2209
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:19,500
Like we have now all of us together

2210
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:21,500
Is it two bucks?

2211
02:49:21,500 --> 02:49:24,500
Two fifty five bucks maybe?

2212
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:26,500
Yeah, and there's a couple ways I'm thinking of doing it

2213
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:28,500
But I want you to think about that when we play

2214
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:30,500
Oh man

2215
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:32,500
This is a great song

2216
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:34,500
I'm not even gonna announce it just listen to

2217
02:49:34,500 --> 02:49:37,500
We know the challenges the tomorrow will bring

2218
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:39,500
Are the greatest of our lives

2219
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:42,500
But America I have never been more hopeful

2220
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:45,500
That I am tonight that we will get there

2221
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:47,500
I promise you

2222
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:50,500
Out of many we are one

2223
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:52,500
That while we breathe we hope

2224
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:55,500
And where we have met with cynicism and doubts

2225
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:58,500

2437
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:49,300
You don't go to hell

2438
03:01:49,300 --> 03:01:51,300
You hate a girl

2439
03:01:51,300 --> 03:01:53,300
You love a girl

2440
03:01:53,300 --> 03:01:54,300
I will

2441
03:01:54,300 --> 03:02:02,940
I'm gonna go to heaven and go to hell.

2442
03:02:02,940 --> 03:02:07,080
Yeah, I like it.

2443
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:11,080
Oh, the conversation in the chat room.

2444
03:02:11,080 --> 03:02:15,260
GX2 is like, why are you playing such shit in music, man?

2445
03:02:15,260 --> 03:02:17,040
Play some rigdies, this is good, Doug, man.

2446
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,340
That's what I really want.

2447
03:02:19,340 --> 03:02:20,980
Marcus Couch had the only correcto.

2448
03:02:20,980 --> 03:02:23,300
Some shun there, the GX2 is just not high enough.

2449
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:29,220
So, some of these songs, and a very interesting new dropbox that I have now subscribed to

2450
03:02:29,220 --> 03:02:35,380
is from Captain Saber II, within the morning to you, hey man, how are you?

2451
03:02:35,380 --> 03:02:36,380
Good.

2452
03:02:36,380 --> 03:02:40,460
So, I don't know, I don't think you've been around the day the source got to you, new to the

2453
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:41,460
show?

2454
03:02:41,460 --> 03:02:43,460
No, I just knew the chat room.

2455
03:02:43,460 --> 03:02:45,100
I knew the chat room.

2456
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:46,100
Where you from?

2457
03:02:46,100 --> 03:02:47,100
Honey Beach.

2458
03:02:47,100 --> 03:02:48,100
California.

2459
03:02:48,100 --> 03:02:51,500
Oh, the California, the people's Republic, no less.

2460
03:02:51,500 --> 03:02:52,500
Yep.

2461
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:54,180
Yeah, what do you do, man?

2462
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:56,180
Um, electrical engineers.

2463
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:58,180
Oh, what?

2464
03:02:58,180 --> 03:02:59,180
Electrical engineer.

2465
03:02:59,180 --> 03:03:00,180
Electrical engineer.

2466
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:01,180
Okay.

2467
03:03:01,180 --> 03:03:03,180
How long you've been listening to the show?

2468
03:03:03,180 --> 03:03:04,180
Oh, oh.

2469
03:03:04,180 --> 03:03:08,060
Are we about the time that it stopped being daily?

2470
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:11,820
Oh, so I like a really, really long time, you mean.

2471
03:03:11,820 --> 03:03:12,820
Yeah.

2472
03:03:12,820 --> 03:03:13,820
All right, man.

2473
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:16,100
Well, I really enjoyed the stuff you got in your dropbox.

2474
03:03:16,100 --> 03:03:17,820
Did I get back from you as well?

2475
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:18,820
Was that where I got that?

2476
03:03:18,820 --> 03:03:19,820
Yes.

2477
03:03:19,820 --> 03:03:20,820
Yeah, that's great shit, man.

2478
03:03:20,820 --> 03:03:21,820
I never heard that song before.

2479
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:23,500
Yeah, it's really good.

2480
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:25,500
You got a shitty headset though, I'll tell you that.

2481
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:26,500
Oh, sorry.

2482
03:03:26,500 --> 03:03:28,860
I was using my, oh, my, oh.

2483
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:29,860
It's not.

2484
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:30,860
Speaker phone, Mike.

2485
03:03:30,860 --> 03:03:31,860
Oh, okay.

2486
03:03:31,860 --> 03:03:32,860
That's all right.

2487
03:03:32,860 --> 03:03:35,980
Well, anyway, so you drop the note in your dropbox and you want to request

2488
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:36,980
the song.

2489
03:03:36,980 --> 03:03:38,820
So, why don't you tell me what you got for us?

2490
03:03:38,820 --> 03:03:43,860
Oh, this is a funk band out of England called The Heavy.

2491
03:03:43,860 --> 03:03:46,140
And they got really happened in tune.

2492
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:48,500
I thought we could use a little more funk on the show.

2493
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:49,500
Yeah.

2494
03:03:49,500 --> 03:03:50,500
Funk is always good.

2495
03:03:50,500 --> 03:03:51,500
Title?

2496
03:03:51,660 --> 03:03:54,100
Uh, the drop in there.

2497
03:03:54,100 --> 03:03:58,860
Ha ha ha ha, how do you, how do you like me now?

2498
03:03:58,860 --> 03:03:59,860
Exactly.

2499
03:03:59,860 --> 03:04:00,860
All right, man.

2500
03:04:00,860 --> 03:04:01,860
I appreciate it.

2501
03:04:01,860 --> 03:04:05,300
And welcome to the the chat room community in the morning to you.

2502
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:06,300
Thank you.

2503
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:07,300
And morning to you.

Get ready.

2514
03:04:47,740 --> 03:04:49,760
Don't know.

2515
03:04:49,760 --> 03:04:55,200
Yeah, I'm a fan, you love all this man

2516
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:57,760
You're thinking, wait, do you see?

2517
03:04:57,760 --> 03:05:00,640
I can't wait, I can't wait

2518

Yeah, I was alive, and that you can't even

2524
03:05:35,200 --> 03:05:41,440
If I was to see you, I don't know what you see right through me

2525
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:49,040
I you'd like it now, I you'd like it now,I you'd like it now, I you'd like it now.

2526
03:05:49,040 --> 03:06:02,480

2528
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:32,840
That's not opinion. That's science. And science is one cold-hearted bitch with a 14-inch strap on.

2529
03:06:32,840 --> 03:06:35,840
The science is in!

What are you doing right now?

2548
03:15:20,840 --> 03:15:21,840
Sit next.

2549
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:23,840
What are you doing on a Friday afternoon?

2550
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:24,840
Just chillin' out.

2551
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:27,840
Back in my bunker, it's the back extension of my house.

2552
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:28,840
It's very cabin-like.

2553
03:15:28,840 --> 03:15:31,840
It's solid oak, and it's really nice.

2554
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:33,840
This is where you've got your room.

2555
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:35,840
I've got my room now.

2556
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:38,840
You've just inherited yours, but I've had mine for a while.

2557
03:15:38,840 --> 03:15:40,840
This is my space.

2558
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:43,840
Just chillin' got the widescreen monitor going,

2559
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:46,840
split screen, watching the chat, and doing other things.

2560
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:49,840
You're kind of creative with the music you were playing, which is great.

2561
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:51,840
That's what the idea is about.

2562
03:15:51,840 --> 03:15:53,840
So I've got Margie Lou.

2563
03:15:53,840 --> 03:15:55,840
We've got Silver.

2564
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:56,840
Yes, that's the part.

2565
03:15:56,840 --> 03:15:57,840
Let's see.

2566
03:15:57,840 --> 03:15:58,840
Day Zilla.

2567
03:15:58,840 --> 03:16:01,840
And GX2 was also a girl today.

2568
03:16:01,840 --> 03:16:02,840
No.

2569
03:16:02,840 --> 03:16:04,840
Well, and you know, it's just be awesome.

2570
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:06,840
And she wished he was a girl sometimes.

2571
03:16:06,840 --> 03:16:07,840
That's wonderful.

2572
03:16:07,840 --> 03:16:13,840
So, you actually, you said maybe the only thing that will cheer up GX2 is play one of his songs.

2573
03:16:13,840 --> 03:16:16,840
Yeah, I think, you were asking me what should I play?

2574
03:16:16,840 --> 03:16:18,840
And I'm like, you know, he's just so hardcore, so original.

2575
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:21,840
I think that you should choose your favorite GXT.

2576
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:23,840
I'm sorry, GX2.

2577
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:24,840
GX2, too.

2578
03:16:24,840 --> 03:16:25,840
Yes.

2579
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:26,840
Submitted.

2580
03:16:26,840 --> 03:16:27,840
All right.

2581
03:16:27,840 --> 03:16:29,840
