1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
I gotta do a brand new day, it's now

2
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,140
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

3
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,540
I know you're with the like it if you give it a chance now

4
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,340
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,140
My little bit is here, look and do it with ease

6
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,900
It's easy, I love you, baby, it's easy

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,320
So come on, come on, do it a lot of attention with ease

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,220
You've got to swing it out, it's now

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,180
Come on, come on, do it a lot of attention

10
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,260
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

11
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,900
Come on, come on, do it a lot of attention

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,340
Well, let's make it change now

13
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,700
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,940
I know you're with the like it if you give it a chance now

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,540
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

16
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,120
I know you're with the like it is now

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,200
Come on, do it a lot of attention

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,940
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,380
Come on, do it a lot of attention

20
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,700
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,680
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,660
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,360
Come on, baby, you look up the motion

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,400
Now get in the line

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:26,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:56,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,040
Thanks for filling up the hard drive everybody. It's highly appreciated. It really helps when I'm doing other stuff

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,680
Just to see the all the tracks slipping in

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Continuously

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,280
Think we got uh, I want to do something different today

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Maybe instead of just the

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,560
All drop box all requests perhaps we even do a dedication type of Charlie. I I did hook up the Skype to the system

33
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Maybe we can have people call in

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
Dedicate their songs and that'll play it for it

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
See we can get a little more involved

36
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,960
If you're listening now at the stream no agenda stream.com the party is always on in the chat room

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,780
No agenda chat dot net today stores code snap through Saturday for the 23rd of October

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Who hunts friends

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
body

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
When it takes you

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
You can't sleep

42
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
You can't eat

43
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
There's no doubt

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,520
You're in deep

45
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
You're from this chains

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,840
You can't breathe

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm not a kiss

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
As I can be

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,720
You like to think that you're into the snow

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh, yeah

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Of course we'll do the truth

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I say yeah

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Can't be anything

55
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,960
You don't have to face the truth

56
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,800
You're too too close to the side

57
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,080
You can't breathe

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
Running at

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,280
Different speed

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
Your heart beats

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Double time

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
And the kiss

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
You'll be mine

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
No one's right and right

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
You can't be seen

66
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
But with me I'm alone

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
And I'm you great

68
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
For this song

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
And for you

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
You don't mind

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Can you do

72
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Oh, you like to think that you're into the snow

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,840
Oh, yeah

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,720
Of course we'll do the truth

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,680
I say yeah

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
Can't be anything

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,680
You're going to have to face the truth

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
You're too too close

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,920
My ears will be torn

80
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Take to love

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,320
My ears will be torn

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
Take it to love

83
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
My ears will be torn

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Take it to love

85
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
My ears will be torn

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,880
Take it to love

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
My ears will be torn

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
Take it to love

89
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,080
Can't be anything

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
But like some odd

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
But you're not home

92
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
You're all weird

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
You're all weird

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
You're heart sweeps

95
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
And keep your mind

96
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
And go to kiss

97
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
And you'll be mine

98
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Oh, you like to think that you're into the snow

99
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,480
Oh, yeah

100
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Just goes away

101
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
Through the truth I say yeah

102
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,680
Can't be anything

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
You're going to have to face the truth

104
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
Take it to love

105
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm kind of doing a little rain dance here at the Hiltop Watch Tower

106
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,240
Crackhot Command Center trying to play as many sunny songs as possible

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
Because we have had nothing but crap weather for the past

108
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
We're going to have it's just been total shit

109
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
That's why we need a little bit of cowbell

110
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,120
No one I'm saying yo

111
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Thank you Marcus Couch

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,360

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
Is kiss

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
Caught and duck the love

115
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,600
You need my love

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,840
Take the most so bad

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,120
You're not the only one I've ever had

118
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
And if I say I want to set you free

119
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
Don't you know you'll be a miss or free

120
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
They call me

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,600
They call me duck to love

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm kind of doing a little rain dance here at the Hiltop Watch Tower

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm kind of doing a little rain dance here at the Hiltop Watch Tower

124
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
And if I say I want to set you free

125
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,200
Don't you know you'll be a miss or free

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
Don't you know you'll be a miss or free

127
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
Even though I'm full of sin

128
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,920
In the old days

129
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,600
Let me in

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
You let me through this walking

131
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
You can't do all

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,000
You need my love and touch alone

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
It's true

134
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
So enter please

135
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Get on your knees

136
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,960
There are no bills there are no fees

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,720
They may I know what the problem is

138
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
The first step of your illness

139
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
I can't see

140
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
So come, sweetheart

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
They call me duck to love

142
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm kind of doing a little rain dance here at the Hiltop Watch Tower

143
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,960
Let me in

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,560
They call me duck to love

145
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm kind of doing a little rain dance here at the Hiltop Watch Tower

146
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,820
We'll save the world up right now

147
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

148
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:55,200
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh true.

149
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
uh

150
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,520
I gotta pop my soul off on a coroner to get completely ready for this show and then I've got an idea

151
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,200
They don't want to talk to you guys about kiss

152
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,980
They call me back the love on the snap food Saturday

153
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,380
The second best thing

154
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,880
I'm just in the morning

155
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,380
Here come the gestures, one, two, three

156
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,380
It's so far from my fantasy

157
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,380
I've heard the music, and I let the sea the ground

158
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,380
Dancing in my eyes, and I'm singing along

159
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Yeah

160
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,380
Here come the gestures, one, two, three

161
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Your mother's calling but you're having fun

162
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,380
You found your dancing home in your nightclub

163
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Put your letter together, you see the loud

164
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,380
It's so far from my heart

165
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,380
I can hope fantasy

166
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,380
It's so far from my heart

167
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,380
I can only dream

168
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:58,380
It's so far from my heart

169
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,380
I can only fantasy

170
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,380
It's so far from my heart

171
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,380
I can only dream

172
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,380
It's so far from my heart

173
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,380
It's so far from my heart

174
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,380
Put out the spotlight, one, two, three

175
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,380
It's so far from my heart

176
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
There music, so far from my heart

177
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
I can only dream

178
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,380
It's so far from my heart

179
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
I can only dream

180
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,380
It's so far from my heart

181
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,380
I can only dream

182
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,380
It's so far from my heart

183
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,380
I can only dream

184
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,380
It's so far from my heart

185
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
I can only dream

186
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,380
It's so far from my heart

187
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,380
I can only dream

188
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,380
I'm thinking Marcus Couch just moved in with me

189
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I am bringing your MP3 collection with you, my friend

190
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,380
That company rock and roll fantasy

191
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
I'm the Charlie episode eight five zero

192
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
Is the sun tries to peek through

193
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,380
Just a little bit here at the Hilltop Watch Tower

194
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,380
It's a track spot command center in Gipmonation West

195
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
Alright, here's what I'd like to do

196
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
If you've got a drop box you've shared

197
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
And you've got some tunes in there

198
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
You'd like to share with the group

199
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,380
I hop into the chat room with no agenda chat.net

200
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
And give me your Skype name, I'll call you

201
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,380
And we'll do a dedication on the air

202
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,380
Alright

203
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm hungry, I'm hungry

204
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,380
You don't have to read my mind

205
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,380
To know what I have in mind

206
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Honey, you wanna know

207
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
Now you move so fine

208
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Let me lay it all the light

209
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,380
I wanna know what you're doing

210
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,380
End of the show

211
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Now it's time to give you

212
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,380
We can make a secret running through

213
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
Just me and you

214
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,380
That's all you're loving like you never do

215
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,380
That's why I hop into the chat room

216
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,380
You'd like to share with the group

217
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,380
I gotta say that over hungry

218
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Come on baby, do you want to dance

219
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,380
I hop into the chat room

220
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,380
Gip it feels alright

221
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Maybe you can stay alright

222
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,380
Shall I live you my key?

223
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,380
What you got to give me a sign

224
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Oh no, so kind of sign

225
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Tell me, are you hot mama

226
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,380
You sure love that way to me

227
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Are you losing now

228
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,380
Will you be ready when I call your love?

229
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Is my timing right

230
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,380
It'll save your love for me tonight

231
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah, I hop into the chat room

232
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
Check it and see

233
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Feeling free my burning inside of me

234
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,380
Come on baby, do you want to dance

235
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,380
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

236
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,380
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

237
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,380
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

238
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,380
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

239
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

240
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Now it's up to you

241
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Can we make a secret run at blue

242
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Oh, you won't do

243
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,380
You'll have to get away from you no

244
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Where I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm cold to see

245
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Got to feel that over hundred free

246
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Come on baby, do you want to dance

247
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,380
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

248
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:33,380
I think I need to revise my statement there about how I'm going to do these

249
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,380
dedications and Paulins on the show.

250
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,380
Here's what you do.

251
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,380
I'd like you to drop a note into your drop box that you shared with me, hopefully.

252
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,380
We have enough of them and this enough to get through the show.

253
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Drop a note in there with a song you'd like to request and your Skype name so that I can get back to you.

254
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
We can put you on the show. How does that sound?

255
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Adam Curry.

256
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:32,380
I'm gonna watch it go away.

257
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,380
I'm gonna watch it go away.

258
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,380
I'm gonna watch it go away.

259
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:50,380
I'm gonna watch it go away.

260
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,380
You take their right. Come on.

261
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Even Sean John.

262
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
The things are small.

263
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,380
They use small heard.

264
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,380
But not me.

265
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,380
I'm just wonderland Marsh.

266
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,380
I work in outputting up

267
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,380
Archie sticks using my mouth,

268
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
Doesn't have gone speed and worse

269
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,140
I'm right now, I'm running out

270
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm getting out

271
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,740
To the city, we can see

272
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,340
I'll be here to be

273
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,100
Now is where all the people are so messed up

274
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,180
I'll be right now

275
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm not afraid to be gone

276
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
As I'm here, I'm not afraid to share time

277
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,380
I'm not worried I'm making you

278
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,820
At the time, I'm not afraid to be tired

279
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,860
I come to make you so late

280
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,860
At the time, I'm not afraid to be tired

281
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,500
So much larger than yours

282
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,900
At the time, I'm gonna wash it

283
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,380
Rowling in time

284
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,020
That's not opinion, that's science

285
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,860
And science is one core at the edge of the 14-year-old

286
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,980
All my life is one big adventure

287
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,500
Always through our days

288
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,020
With a shoulder from the heart through the day

289
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,180
I heard it makes like a magic ring

290
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,900
This will wipe below for my big advantage

291
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,900
And whatever will be taken

292
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,060
I'm not afraid to be tired

293
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,780
I'm not afraid I'm making you

294
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,300
At the time, I'm not afraid to be tired

295
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,660
I've got to make you so late

296
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,500
At the time, I'm not afraid to be tired

297
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,900
So much larger than mine

298
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,900
That's not opinion, that's science

299
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,900
And science is one core at the edge of the 14-year-old

300
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,900
All my life is one big adventure

301
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,900
My heart is not afraid to be tired

302
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,900
My heart is not afraid to be tired

303
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,660
My heart is not afraid to be tired

304
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,220
I'm not afraid to be tired

305
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,900
My fingers are not afraid to be tired

306
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,900
My heart is not afraid to be tired

307
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,940
I've got to make you so late

308
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,100
At the time, I'm not afraid to be tired

309
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,100
My heart is not afraid to be tired

310
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,100
I'm not afraid to be tired

311
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Yeah

312
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,100
From the crack box to the bus

313
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,100
From the crack box to the bus

314
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Yeah, freezing your shizzle

315
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Yeah, keeps me out in Don't be tired

316
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Keeps me out in Don't be tired

317

Don't be tired

318
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Don't be tired

319
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,100
One, one

320
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Shut up, stay

321
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Fuck all of you, we're here to rock

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,100

That's a mall we know now

527
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
We're rock your eyes

528
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
The birds, but up to your star

529
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
We'll be so high

530
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Who falls a low west

531
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Soon as we go

532
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Has a bridge to the floor

533
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
And make sure the song

534
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
Deforestation and souls

535
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Dear Adam, you've used up to 90% of the allocated traffic in your account

536
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
We'll be in activate automatically

537
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,980
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

538
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,980
Deforestation and souls

539
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,980
So, I'll play the hand roll

540
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
A tight, the middle

541
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Clean the two holes

542
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
The glow rotates

543
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
From the old, the old

544
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Beauty has teapot

545
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
The reached the souls

546
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
Narrow eyes, stars are there

547
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Still holding the holes

548
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Do up before and before

549
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
And when we come close

550
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
To the contrary

551
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
They can't stay alone

552
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
They call it road rock

553
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,980
But it's a deep unshreener soul

554
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
These fish hair are so

555
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
My hair

556
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,980
A deep fish hair are so

557
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
A deep fish hair are so

558
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,980
A deep fish hair are so

559
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Oh no, no, no, no, no

560
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Deforestation and souls

561
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,980
We plan everything

562
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,980
With a color of skin on the skin

563
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,980
We're in like sweat

564
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Tox there it is

565
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
And soon as we begin

566
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,980
And when I play the frame of thought there are it

567
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Again, you've since got to do with the villains

568
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
It's not where you're from

569
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
It's can they use it

570
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
The stuff you brought

571
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
And that we are given

572
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
A piece of the mind

573
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,980
Connect with the rhythm

574
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,980
The special soul

575
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah

576
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,980
This we share the soul

577
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
And it's time

578
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
What do you shit and so

579
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
I'll cook the wrong breakfast

580
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,540
I once tasted was shared

581
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:26,980
And so

582
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,980
At the emotions the lack that aren't running

583
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,780
What I'd sayower and a Auf

584
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
What I said

585
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,980
But I lost what I said

586
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
Love and me pass

587
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,980
But all lies

588
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,380
All lies

589
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:56,380
All right, all right, all right, all right

590
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,380
Deep we share the song

591
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,380
And deep we share the song

592
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,380
And deep we share the song

593
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,380
And deep we share the song

594
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,380
And deep we share the song

595
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,380
And deep we share the song

596
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,380
And deep we share the song

597
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,380
And deep we share the song

598
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,380
May not be entirely familiar to some of the US based Charlie and Chuckle heads up there

599
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,380
Dutch band Urban Dam Squat, the deeper shade of soul

600
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,380
I wonder what those guys are up to these days

601
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Everything's huge hit back in the day

602
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Fucking awesome, I like it the same time

603
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,380
And really has their shit together

604
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,380
Okay, we've up the band width

605
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
So we can continue the program, not a problem

606
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,380
Remember if you want to dedicate something on the air here in the Charlie

607
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,380
We're doing Skype calls, just drop a little note in your Dropbox

608
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Share that with me and I'll get around to you eventually

609
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
I think I'll try

610
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
I'll do my absolute best

611
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,380
Gotta tell you guys have an eclectic taste

612
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
Really loving it though

613
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
Remember these cats?

614
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Known as the BIOS?

615
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,380
Shhh

616
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,380
Shhh

617
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Shhh

618
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,380
Shhh

619
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,380
Shhh

620
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,380
Shhh

621
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,380
He went on a shoot

622
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,380
And he got

623
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,380
Told you and football he got

624
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
Walk you finger

625
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Shhh

626
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,380
Go, go, go, go

627
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,380
He said, I know you

628
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,380
You know me

629
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,380
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

630
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,380
Come together

631
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,380
Right now

632
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,380
Over me

633
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,380
Shhh

634
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,380
Shhh

635
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,380
Shhh

636
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,380
Shhh

637
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,380
Shhh

638
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,380
Shhh

639
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,380
Shhh

640
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,380
Shhh

641
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,380
Shhh

642
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,380
He back in touch

643
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,380
He got

644
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,380
All this gun would be cut

645
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,380
Oh no, sad boy he won

646
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,380
Spiral cracker

647
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,380
He got feet

648
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,380
Down below his knee

649
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,380
Hold you in his arm

650
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,380
Share you can't feel his disease

651
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,380
Come together

652
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,380
Right now

653
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
Over me

654
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,380
Shhh

655
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,380
Right

656
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,380
Shhh

657
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,380
Shhh

658
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,380
Shhh

659
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,380
Shhh

660
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,380
Shhh

661
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,380
Shhh

662
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,380
Shhh

663
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,380
Shhh

664
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,380
Right

665
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:54,380
You roll the ghost and he got Ellie wanted, he got Marty wanted, he wanted, he wanted more, you'll filter, he said, one, one, one, one is three

666
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:06,380
Got to be good looking, got to be so hard to see, come together, right now, all of me

667
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:28,380
We'll sing as we'll never see that on iTunes, we'll sing as we'll never see that on iTunes

668
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:41,380
I guess we might as well share it here on the Charminer, kind of the place where we've been doing that lately

669
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:49,380
You know, I have been touring again, I just can't help myself with the idea, hopping on the screen once a day and doing something non-musical

670
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,380
It's just been so much amazing shit that's coming out these days

671
00:46:53,380 --> 00:47:00,380
And I didn't last night with a couple of nice folks here in LA, we are not alone

672
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:07,380
That's for damn sure, I can wow, just do something short 30 minutes a day

673
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,380
But that can't happen until I find a freaking intern or someone to help me with the editing of the big app shows

674
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,380
That takes up a lot of time, in fact it's like a sinkhole of time is what it is

675
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:28,380
Yeah, so I've got the lovely Miss Christina here who was staying the night before she goes back down the hill

676
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,380
And let me just see if she's there

677
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,380
Yeah, so she shows me this picture

678
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:43,380
She was hanging out yesterday, it's not very far, let me see Marilyn Manson, people got that

679
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:50,380
Yeah, she gets around, I'm just sitting here, growing cobwebs

680
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,380
Meanwhile, the kid is having a rock and sound

681
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:01,380
So this is one of those falsely labeled songs, it's not the temptations, it's his love, tender, and version

682
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,380
What's great about it though, is it is a live version

683
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,380
You love this song, every time I turn around I'm back in love again with you

684
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,380
Sounds like they got some clobbies, some wood they're knocking on

685
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,380
And maybe a cowbell or two, right?

686
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,380
Leave on Charlie eight, five, zero

687
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Here it's time, I'll find you, we're out for a minute

688
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,380
Here we come, I'll find you, I'll find you

689
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:31,380
I'll get out of the hole, I'll find you

690
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,380
I might be alone

691
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:40,380
Here we come, I'll find you, I'll find you

692
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Sometimes I just don't need you

693
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:52,380
You'll find me, when I look at me, when we're tired, I'll find you

694
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:59,380
I'll find you, I'll get out of the hole, I'll get out of the hole

695
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,380
Now I'll find you, when you put your arms around me

696
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,380
I feel so sad, it's fine

697
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:15,380
I hope to love you forever, yeah

698
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,380
I just can't, I think it's fine

699
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,380
Yeah, let's have a happy one, let's have a baby

700
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:32,380
I'll find you, I'll get out of the hole, I'll find you

701
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:38,380
I'll find you, I'll find you

702
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:45,380
I'll find you, I'll get out of the hole, I'll get out of the hole

703
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,380
Now I'll find you, I'll find you

704
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:57,380
I'll find you, I'll find you

705
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,380
I'll get out of the hole, I'll get out of the hole

706
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:07,180
Now I'll find you, I'll find you

707
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:13,780
I'll find you, I'll find you

708
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,780
Now I'll find you, I'll find you

709
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,780
You go for it

710
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,780
Just something you'll have to go back

711
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,780
I can't stop to go and love a little bit

712
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,780
Yeah, it's time for fun

713
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,780
Oh, look at me

714
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,780
If it's time to turn around

715
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,780
I just wanna love you

716
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,780
Yeah, it's time to fight

717
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Yeah, yeah

718
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,780
You lies in fights, you fight

719
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
Yeah, it's time to fight

720
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,780
Oh, seriously

721
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
I'm not

722
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,780
I'm not here

723
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,780
Just don't leave me

724
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,780
I am

725
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
I am

726
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,780
I am

727
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,780
I am

728
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,780
I'm not here

729
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,780
Oh, feel so stupid

730
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,780
I can't love again

731
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,780
Can't stop to go back

732
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,780
Yeah, it's time to fight

733
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,780
Yeah, it's time to fight

734
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,780
I'm not here

735
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,780
I'm not here

736
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,780
Oh, c-d

737
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,780
I'm sitting

738
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,060
I personally love together

739
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,060
I've never heard this version though.

740
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Thank you so much for dropping that off in the Dropbox.

741
00:51:54,060 --> 00:52:00,060
Getting requests in every minute or so with new Dropboxes to share.

742
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,060
Down to 40 gigs available on the hard drive here.

743
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,060
So we'll see just how far we get.

744
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,060
And I think it's time to get the party cranked up just a little bit.

745
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,060
I'm curious.

746
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,060
Fuck all of you.

747
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,060
We're here to rock.

748
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:22,060
I'm like...

749
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:28,060
Turn down your speaker.

750
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,060
I'm on it.

751
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:40,060
When I'm with you baby, I go on my roof.

752
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,060
I just can't get enough.

753
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,060
I just can't get enough.

754
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,060
If I'm with you baby, I live with you.

755
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
I just can't get enough.

756
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,060
I just can't get enough.

757
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,560
I just can't get enough, I just can't see things.

758
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Get it, I'm off.

759
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,060
You want to get a walk around the street

760
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,060
I just can't get enough

761
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,060
I just can't get enough

762
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,060
Every time I think you do, I know we have to meet

763
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,060
I just can't get enough

764
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,060
I just can't get enough

765
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,060
It's getting hard, it's a pretty low

766
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:38,060
And I just can't seem to get enough

767
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:59,060
I just can't get enough

768
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:04,060
I just can't get enough

769
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,060
I just can't get enough

770
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,060
I just can't get enough

771
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,060
I just can't get enough

772
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,060
I just can't get enough

773
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:22,320
I just can't get enough. I just can't get enough. I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.

774
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:28,100
I just can't get enough. I just can't get enough. I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.

775
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,240
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.

776
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,460
And we break, you just shot in love for me.

777
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,960
I just can't get enough. I just can't get enough.

778
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,460
Just like we're rainbow, you know you set free.

779
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,460
And I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

780
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,460
You're laughing too hard, you're laughing too hard

781
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:53,460
And I just can't seem to get you apart

782
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:19,460
I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

783
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:24,460
Just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

784
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:30,460
Just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

785
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,460
But I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

786
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:40,460
Lookin' true, I can't get enough

787
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:51,980
Yeah, that takes me back as well. The best mode just can't get enough in the daily source

788
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,300
code episode eight five zero coming to you from the Hilltop Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center.

789
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,580
As promised, I'm going to do some dedications today on the air try something new. I think

805
00:59:35,700 --> 01:00:05,700
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

806
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:35,700
Kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love

807
01:00:35,700 --> 01:01:05,700
kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, killed my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill my love, kill

808
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,700
have worked for me.

809
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,700
It really did.

810
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,700
And it's nice to put a voice to, you know,

811
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:19,700
line scrolling by on my IRCC.

812
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,700
Terminal here.

813
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,700
And no more people really are at.

814
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,700
So here's a deal.

815
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,700
If you have a dedication, have a request.

816
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,700
All you gotta do is drop a little text file into your

817
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,700
shared Dropbox folder.

818
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,700
With your Skype name.

819
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,700
And whatever details you want to get me.

820
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:43,700
So I can add you as a contact and bring it on the air.

821
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,700
I really like that.

822
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,700
I think that's the, well, actually, back from I was in the,

823
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,700
in London.

824
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,700
I think we did it a couple times.

825
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,700
But never really with that kind of success.

826
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,700
You've got it all hooked up.

827
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,700
So the sound is actually fairly decent.

828
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,700
All right, let's do that.

829
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,700
Totally digging that.

830
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,700
Thank you, Ella Jack, if you request Don Henley's dirty laundry.

831
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,700
Certainly one of my favorite Don Henley tunes.

832
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,700
The guy, well, if you've never heard of stuff,

833
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,700
he's got a couple of very cool tunes.

834
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,700
Inside job being one of my favorites without a doubt.

835
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:22,700
How about one of the ugliest guys in show business?

836
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,700
I mean, the guy's awesome.

837
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,700
He's got a big hit.

838
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,700
At the week there.

839
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,700
Joe Jackson's stepping out on the Charlie.

840
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,700
The miss the cross.

841
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,700
The window hides the land.

842
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,700
But nothing has the color of the lines.

843
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,700
That shine.

844
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,700
Electricity is so fun.

845
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,700
Look at dry roads.

846
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:24,700
So tired of all the darkness in a light.

847
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:34,700
With no more angry words to say could come alive.

848
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,700

882
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:30,740
Now, when it comes to bringing back the art of radio globally, there's a couple things

883
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,700
that we do here on the daily source code if you're new to the program, it seems like

884
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:39,820
the audience does appear to be growing again over the years.

885
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:44,480
We definitely play songs that you probably never would or ever will here on commercial

886
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,960
radio mainly because they're just too damn long and we need to get some commercials

887
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:48,960
in there.

888
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,960

You know where to be.

1193
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,580
As we are well into the second half of the show

1194
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:26,820
On the snafu Saturday

1195
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:30,900
Yeah, it is the what are we here today the 23rd of October

1196
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,820
2010

1197
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:39,380
Snafu Saturday we roll out songs that you never hear on the radio never have heard him probably never will hear him and we're going to get

1198
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:43,220
Monation Kiwi where we've got a Kiwi Chris on the line Kiwi. How you doing man?

1199
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,020
Oh, hold on a second for some reason. Are you there?

1200
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:55,140
Yeah, I'm here man. Okay. There you go. Hey buddy. How are you? I'm good man. Excellent. This is it. This is really going off. This is fantastic

1201
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:59,540
Yeah, it's working. Hey listen. Are you anywhere in your Christ church and all the earthquake machine activity

1202
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:07,220
We're in the north island. So about four hours drive away. I've had a number of friends from down that way

1203
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:12,020
They're still going on man. They're up to about four and a half thousand shakes since the big one

1204
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:16,740
Yeah, what's up with that? I mean, is this like a normal occurrence for there or is this completely new?

1205
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:23,700
Now, this is completely new for them. They yeah, this they've never had a earthquake on this particular fault

1206
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:27,540
But it's been really going off. They've been getting fours almost every day

1207
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:33,460
And this still you know, a liquefaction where the sand comes up through the ground and people's houses are being

1208
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:38,980
Absolutely fine basic like that's that's crazy man because you know, what does the ministry of true saying?

1209
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:45,140
What is the new saying about what what this is all about? There's a I mean no one predicted this that geologists could know it

1210
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:47,140
It just all of sudden appears out of thin air

1211
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:49,780
Yeah, just seemed just seemed to happen and

1212
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:56,340
It caught everyone by surprise the geologist and the and the tectomic guys are just going off the planet as far as excitement goes

1213
01:38:56,340 --> 01:39:00,260
You know, there's probably stains all over their house, but they got word big time

1214
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:08,180
But some know that I'm in the government's doing a pretty good job of managing it. Obviously everyone down there's under stress and strain

1215
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:13,220
But some I think it's coming out okay by the sounds of it. Well, I find it fascinating

1216
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:17,460
What do you guys have oil or something? There must be something going on there might be some value in damn hills

1217
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:21,460
Yeah, the probably is but we haven't been told about it

1218
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:28,100
Well Chris we certainly hope that you stay safe but it sounds like you're far enough away from the fault line that nothing should happen

1219
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:31,620
How big is New Zealand actually in in in in area?

1220
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:36,340
Oh, it's probably about the same size as England I suppose and

1221
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:41,620
Then we've got about four million four and a five million people I suppose

1222
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:46,340
Yeah, it's a pretty cool place to live. It's just a long way to get to anywhere

1223
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:48,580
She know when I visited you in San Francisco

1224
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:53,060
You know it's a 12-hour flight from here and it's well with you know spending some time

1225
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:58,740
Once you get out of the country. I don't know if you noticed when we met because we met twice in the office

1226
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:05,300
The media office, but I was walking down second street. I'm just strolling along just minding mill business all of a sudden

1227
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:10,100
I can feel like someone behind me and then someone calls out money and you're not a small guy

1228
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:12,980
You're like you're like a six six-foot tall or something like a

1229
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:18,820
Always you know, I have this idea like someone's gonna sneak up one day and give me two to the head and I'll be it

1230
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,540
It was tempting

1231
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:28,100
All right Chris, so you got some real kiwi music for us for the show

1232
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,180
Yeah, this is this is an old one

1233
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:36,340
I managed to dig it out of my eye because somewhere it was that this was about the same time as David Bowie was sort of hitting a stride

1234
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:38,820
And it was a kiwi band that

1235
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:43,540
Sort of put something together and it sounds pretty good really and something you definitely would never hear on the radio

1236
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,540
Certainly not and get monation proper

1237
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,340
Up on the on the upside of the of the globe

1238
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:51,140
Yeah, absolutely not all right. You want to tell us what it is

1239
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:55,140
It's the thing called space folks and it was out on the street was the name of it

1240
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:58,180
It was I think there was a fair bit of acid being taken at the time

1241
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,540
How the good old days good times

1242
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,340
All right Chris, thank you so much man and Steve safe down there and check in from time the time

1243
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,340
Letters know what's going on okay

1244
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,340
All right in the morning to you

1245
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:36,820
Who's

1246
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,460
Wrong

1247
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:56,140
I'm a boy who tried to follow her, trying to she aspires

1248
01:41:56,140 --> 01:42:01,140
She's out how long the street, out of the street

1249
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:05,140
But she talks to everyone she needs, out of the street

1250
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:11,140
She needs no roots, she tells you she's right, she knows

1251
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:15,140
I'm on the street, out of the street

1252
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:19,140
And she talks to everyone she needs, out of the street

1253
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:24,140
She tells you she's right, she knows she's wrong

1254
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:29,140
I'm on the street, out of the street

1255
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:36,140
I try to get myself out of the street, she tells you she's right, she knows

1256
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:43,140
I'm on the street, out of the street, out of the street
