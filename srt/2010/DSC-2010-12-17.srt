Has this going so that might be better than tears

344
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
It's just me

345
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:10,720
It's just me

346
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,720
It's just me

347
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
There's only one thing I can start

348
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Wow

349
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
I never played the fuck out of that song on MTV

350
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Jim Blossom's hate jealousy

351
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Here on your daily source code you full bar Friday

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
December 17, 2010

353
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
One of the last shows for this year

354
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
And the party of course as always

355
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
is at no agenda show dot com for the

356
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
No agenda stream dot com for the stream of course

357
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
No agenda chat dot net for the real party

358
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,720
And everybody is hanging out

359
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Wait for their song to be played as they drop it in my box

360
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
It's Friday

361
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
And yes

362
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I am in love

363
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
It's just me

364
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:05,720
So that's what it is

365
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,720
In order for the party to be played as a monster

366
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
No agenda website

367
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Here on YouTube

368
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,120
Max

369
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I don't care if one day's blues, you say it's grey and when you say it's

370
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,720
First day I don't care about you, it's brighter, I'm in love

371
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,720
All day you can fall apart, you say when say break my heart

372
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,720
All Thursday doesn't even start it's Friday, I'm in love

373
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Saturday, break my heart

374
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Someday always comes to play

375
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,720
The Friday never has it's day, I don't care if one day's blues

376
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Tuesday when say heart to touch, first day never looking back

377
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,720
It's Friday, I'm in love

378
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,720
All day you can fall apart, you say when say stay in bed

379
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,720
All Thursday watch the walls in stead is Friday, I'm in love

380
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Saturday, break my heart

381
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Someday always comes to play

382
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,720
The Friday never has it's day, I don't care if one day's blues

383
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Tuesday when say heart to touch, first day you can fall apart

384
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I don't care if one day's blues, you say when say heart to touch

385
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
All day you can fall apart

386
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,720
All day you can fall apart

387
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,720
All day you can fall apart

388
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,720
All day you can fall apart

389
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I got a pair of them.

390
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,720
I got a pair of them.

391
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,720
I got a pair of them.

392
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I got a pair of them.

393
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
I got a pair of them.

394
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Two days grey and one day change.

395
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Such a day in way.

396
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,720
So they always come simply.

397
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
The Friday never has it's end.

398
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Just up to the eyes.

399
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
It's a wonderful surprise.

400
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
See your shoes and your spirits dry.

401
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Don't let you frown and just smile.

402
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
See guys, she's spinning round that round.

403
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Always take a big bite.

404
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
It's such a gorgeous sight.

405
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,720
To see you ain't in love with love in life.

406
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,720
If you can never get in love with this dog,

407
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,720
It's Friday, I'm in love.

408
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,720
I don't care if my face moves.

409
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,720
You stay straight and Wednesday too.

410
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Thursday, I don't care about you.

411
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
It's Friday, I'm in love.

412
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm late, you can fall apart.

413
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,720
You stay Wednesday, break my heart.

414
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Thursday doesn't even start its Friday.

415
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm in love with those of you who support this program or the no agenda.

416
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Know that your support at your appropriate giving level has enabled me to bring on Kevin the blade of the intern.

417
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,720
It's so beautiful because not only do we rush to everything today and I recorded my big app show.

418
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,720
He's an editing in the other room, but he also went out and got me lunch.

419
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,720
My god, my life has changed so much and I really, really appreciate all of that.

420
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Great to have him here.

421
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Sorry about starting just a little bit late.

422
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Just as I was ready to go into the second round of app shows, I needed to record today.

423
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Christina called me.

424
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
She learned a very important lesson.

425
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
You can't count on other people.

426
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
She was at the gym, which is not exactly the next door to where she lives.

427
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
And someone was supposed to pick her up.

428
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
And it's been raining all day in Los Angeles, supposed to be raining for most of the weekend.

429
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,720
And she did not take any money or a, or even a bank card.

430
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,720
It's like, oh, Daddy, can you please come and big me up?

431
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
And what are you going to say, man? What are you going to say?

432
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,720
And yeah, so it's, it's very interesting not to be smoking and doing a show.

433
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Actually, I was talking after no agenda on Thursday, yesterday with John C. to Warack.

434
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,720
And I was saying that, you know, it really my entire thing has always been, you know, the lights are low.

435
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I've got like my one light going on. I've got my mixer and almost totally in the dark.

436
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,720
I've got my green Pfizer on and I'm doing my radio shows.

437
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,720
You know, that's kind of the, that's the old school way of doing it.

438
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
And with that, of course, you need to cigarette.

439
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Those days, my friends, unfortunately, are just over.

440
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
I don't come in.

441
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I don't take the source code.

442
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I don't come in.

443
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I don't get caught in the source.

444
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I don't go in.

445
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I am a miserable world.

446
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Because you need an end of it without you.

447
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,720
And without you.

448
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,720
So now I'm nothing to you.

449
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
So fuck you, too.

450
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Now you tell me that you're rather than me.

451
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,720
But you're gonna just get your promise.

452
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,720
You'll be lying.

453
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,720
No, no, no, no.

454
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,720
No, no, no, no, no.

455
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
So fuck you, too.

456
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:48,720
So now I am nothing to you.

457
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
So fuck you, too.

458
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I am not in my mind.

459
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Who's losing and I'm losing all the time.

460
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I know I am nothing to you.

461
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
So fuck you, too.

462
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Now I'm nothing to you.

463
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,720
So fuck you, too.

464
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Now you tell me that you're rather than me.

465
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
So fuck you, too.

466
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Now you tell me that you're rather than me.

467
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,720
No, no, no, no, no, no.

468
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

469
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,720
You tell me that you're rather than me.

470
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,720
But you're won't blame my life.

471
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,720
But you'll get it, you'll make it to get with my soul.

472
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,720
So now I am nothing to you.

473
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,720
So fuck you, too.

474
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
That's kind of the way you feel by the way.

475
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
It's so good that Miss Mickey and I stop together.

476
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
And I'm very, very proud of her action.

477
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I didn't think she could do it.

478
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,720
And I guess 12 days and mine as well be 120 days or 1200 days, right?

479
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,720
But definitely, I feel like saying fuck you, too.

480
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Can't help it.

481
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Anyway, we still should be able to roll through the source code nicely today.

482
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Bring you all kinds of tunes, take you on a musical roller coaster ride in Johnny Cougar.

483
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Because there's a black man with black hair.

484
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Little black man.

485
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
He's got it.

486
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,720
In the state running through his front yard, you know what you think?

487
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
He's got it so good.

488
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
And there's a woman in the kitchen.

489
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,720
We're not feeling it's love.

490
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
And it looks better since they don't.

491
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I can't remember when you could stop a flower.

492
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
I already thought America, you and me.

493
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Ain't got America, something to see baby.

494
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Ain't got America, home on the free air.

495
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Little black houses for you and me.

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Oh, yeah.

497
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
We're running.

498
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Well, it was a young man.

499
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,720
In a decent, a list of rock and roll stations.

500
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
He's got it.

501
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
He's got it.

502
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
He's got it.

503
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
He's got it.

504
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
He's got it.

505
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
He's got it.

506
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
He's got it.

507
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
He's got it.

508
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
He's got it.

509
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
He's got it.

510
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
He's got it.

511
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
He's got it.

512
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
He's got it.

513
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
He's got it.

514
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
He's got it.

515
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
He's got it.

516
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
He's got it.

517
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
He's got it.

518
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
He's got it.

519
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
He's got it.

520
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
He's got it.

521
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
He's got it.

522
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Wait a minute, oh man.

523
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
He's got it.

524
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
He's got it.

525
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,520
He's got it.

526
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
He's got it.

527
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Yeah, the prethels is for you

528
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Oh, you said I thought you and me

529
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:38,080
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

530
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:47,440
Yeah

531
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,440
When there's people and more people

532
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,440
And what do they not know?

533
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Go to work in some high rise

534
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
And vacation now that's going for me to go

535
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Ooh yeah

536
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
And there's winners

537
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
And there's losers

538
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
But they ain't no big deal

539
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Cause I'm simply my baby

540
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Paced the thrills

541
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
The booze

542
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
The booze

543
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
The booze

544
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
I can't

545
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
All the way

546
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
That's better

547
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
That's better

548
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
You and me

549
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
And that's better

550
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
And that's better

551
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
I suck in the sea

552
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
That's better

553
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
That's better

554
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
That's better

555
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
All my free

556
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Ooh yeah

557
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Look at the cows

558
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
That's better

559
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Ooh yeah

560
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Ooh yeah

561
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,440
You and me

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
And that's better

563
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
You and me

564
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
And that's better

565
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
That's better

566
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Some of the sea

567
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
That's better

568
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
That's better

569
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,440
All my free

570
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
And that's better

571
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

572
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Little big house

573
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Little big houses

574
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
But you and me

575
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
And that's better

576
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
That's better

577
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
The best country to live in

578
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
As far as I've concerned

579
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Even though we have our issues

580
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
We got our problem

581
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
I just realized

582
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Because I'm looking at the chat room

583
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
People are talking about the

584
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,440
Stopping smoking thing

585
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
We've been through so many things

586
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Together on the show

587
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
For those of you been around

588
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
For

589
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Most of the 855 episodes

590
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Holy crap man

591
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
We've been through

592
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
A lot of things

593
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Geez

594
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Some believeable

595
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Including my mom actually

596
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Dying from lung cancer

597
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
All the way full circle to me

598
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Stopping

599
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
So I don't have to die from lung cancer

600
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Although I have to say

601
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
I've always loved my smoke

602
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
I've always loved rolling my own smokes

603
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
I've always loved smoking pure tobacco

604
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
There's many times a day

605
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
When I'm almost doubled over

606
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Going like, oh god

607
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I want a smoke

608
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
And then of course Mickey will say

609
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Well we can smoke

610
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
We can have one smoke

611
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Like no we can't have one

612
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
Smokes

613
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Like no you start

614
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
It's perfect

615
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
We're keeping each other in check

616
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I have to say we've discovered a couple things

617
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
One

618
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Our lungs are not trying to escape

619
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Through our orifices

620
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
In the morning

621
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Which is nice

622
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,440
And I have to say

623
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Within only a few days

624
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
We have already noticed

625
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Enhanced sexual pleasure

626
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
If that doesn't motivate you

627
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
I don't know what does

628
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
That's about the only thing

629
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
We actually can do is humanoids

630
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
No license required

631
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
By the way

632
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Over the past 46 years

633
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
I've got pretty good at it

634
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
And I have to say

635
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
That's about the only thing

636
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
That's about the only thing

637
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
That's about the only thing

638
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
That's about the only thing

639
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
That's about the only thing

640
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440

642
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
That's about the only thing

647
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
That's about the only thing

648
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
That's about the only thing

649
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
That's about the only thing

650
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
That's about the only thing

651
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
That's about the only thing

652
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
That's about the only thing

653
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
That's about the only thing

654
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
That's about the only thing

655
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
That's about the only thing

656
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
That's about the only thing

657
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
That's about the only thing

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
That's about the only thing

659
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
That's about the only thing

660
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
That's about the only thing

661
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
That's about the only thing

662
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
That's about the only thing

663
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
That's about the only thing

664
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
That's about the only thing

665
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Next to the only thing

666
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
That's about the only thing

667
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
That's about the only thing

668
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
That's about the only thing

669
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440

That's about the only thing

672
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
And that's about the only thing

673
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,480
That's about the only thing

674
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,440
That's about the only thing

675
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
That's about the only thing

676
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
That's about the only thing

677
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
That's about the only thing

678
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:57,440
When I come home baby, my house is dark and my thoughts are cold

679
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,440
You ain't around, baby, we're teenagers and I don't know what to do

680
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm getting tired of waiting and fooling around

681
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,440
We want somebody, you won't make it feel like we're all leaving home

682
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

683
00:35:46,440 --> 00:36:13,440
I think it was the moonflower album that I just kept playing over and over and over again at home when I was a kid

684
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,440
I always love Santana man, the Cardo Santana is the sound of his guitar

685
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,440
It's just so outrageously recognizable and just fantastic, I love it

686
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Alright, chat room, so you guys all into the sex talk now that I mentioned that

687
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,440
And of course there's some funny lines in there and I figured well if you guys are having fun together

688
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Maybe I can play something we can all enjoy a little laugh as a community

689
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Some of them are hairy, some of them are bald, some are kinda scary and this is what they're called

690
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Good job, good job, good job, good job

691
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:12,440
They call that thing for China

692
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Some belong to virgins, they're really tight and strong

693
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:30,440
But big or small, I love them all, that's why I sing my song

694
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:39,440
The joy, the joy, the joy, the joy

695
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:51,440
They call that thing for China

696
00:37:52,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Some of them are smelly, like clams and fish and such

697
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Some smell like a summer's eve because they've been dushed too much

698
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Some smell like a summer's eve because they've been dushed too much

699
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Some smell like a summer's eve because they've been dushed too much

700
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Some smell like a summer's eve because they've been dushed too much

701
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Some smell like a summer's eve because they've been dushed too much

702
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:11,440
