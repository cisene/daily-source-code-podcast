1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Are you ready to be full barred?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Delta Shara Charlie 825!

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,440
We've 16 months to 7 minutes and showing 5 rounds of time.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,960
The 21st century of radio starts here.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
We are being lost.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,960
We're getting me alive.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
I know it's gonna strip down her.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,440
I'm casting kiss for Adam Curry.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,960
That's right, everybody!

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,600
It's pregnant time.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,440
This is the first Friday only and everywhere on the chart.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Come on, Chuckle Hans.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you ready to get to use it?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,560
We can start it right when you came to the right place, my friends.

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,200
We must pack up our boat, see me in town.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Down around San Francisco.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
And the boats that ride them all, not the day.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,000
The roundabout day at home.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,880
We brought up a town of Spain.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,880
And the battle where they came.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,160
Where you coming up, try to make a roundabout roll.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,680
Where are you trying to go?

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll be the yellow pizza.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,760
No, they look awesome.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,720
They're all the talk of the town.

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
When I got to kiss the fan, they ran in the sun.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
Don't fall in now.

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,040
They say they're the follows in vain.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,480
And they're Ms. Morgan's again.

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,680
When talking back to China, do that roll.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
Take a blow.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,400
We feel great.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,840
There's new theme, you're gonnaal a smoow in you,

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280
She and my family, but I'll be the same of my sons

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,400
You can't even hear them yet, I'm sick and lie

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
And go and get some power of the world

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
Small state, people don't seem to care

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,760
There's this key for nothing to the key

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Say hello to my little friend, I'm carry, I'm a big sister's girl

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:23,760
Don't be brothers, take it out the full fire Friday for this heat 25

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,720
And after so number that he source code, let's keep it rock and we got to wake up

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,720
We got to get ready for the weekend, Margarse couch and no original chat.com

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Thank you for this time, my friend

44
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,800
As any slows your life, cause it's all you want for it man

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,240
We lose the change like a hurricane, I'm coming to watch a way to stay

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,200
Can you smell a remuneration in the air?

47
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't live with you like a sea, I won't live in the world that you made for me

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,480
Can you smell a remuneration, you won't keep me down, can you hear me now?

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm leaving the line for single day that you told me

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,760
When you're so mad, time to decide when we live your way in the kingdom

51
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,880
With a freedom, steal the way around, take it deep for the night

52
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,960
But I'll fight to keep on, it seems to me if I got one thing and it splats

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,960
We lose the change like a hurricane, I'm coming to watch a way to stay

Partner

96
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,960
The man certainly does live up to his name

97
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Doesn't he part?

98
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,960
On the charlighted 825

100
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Quite a slow behavior of now

101
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,140
Call me time

102
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,420
For those of you that know

103
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,660
Easy sir

104
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Hearer

You receiving us as we are

106
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,100
Why?

107
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,060
It's so much like the old days of pirate radio. I just love it so much. Hey, so sorry for those of you who are waiting for the live show

108
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,080
Which of course takes place at no agenda stream.com and normally I try to get it on around 12, 31 o'clock

109
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,380
My entire week has been not what I expected it to be. Some things went very smoothly

110
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:44,760
But kind of all stacks up in the very end there. It just got delayed including a late phone call from a

111
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Get-monation lowlands is all good though

112
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,620
Maybe I should tell you right off the bat. I'm in a very good mood

113
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,620
I'm not sure if it's because of the conversation we've had about it here on the chalk

114
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,780
I don't know if that at any influence whatsoever

115
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:04,360
I don't believe she listens, but I had a fantastic conversation with Patricia

116
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Soon to be ex-wife

117
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,900
Let's see that was or early. Yeah very early on this week

118
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,140
We had a long conversation like two hours

119
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,660
We had a lot of it was about our daughter Christina it was civilized

120
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:27,060
She said hey, you know what these lawyers their bastards can we just like we agree on everything don't we and I said yeah

121
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,260
But you know the lawyers have been dragging it out and everything every time they they write something

122
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,300
I got a respond and then just stealing your money like of course

123
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,660
I didn't say I told you so because that would not have been appropriate

124
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,980
I felt like saying it, but I said you know like I kind of predicted and

125
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,120
So we just went down the list here's we agree upon she said could you could you please just write that up?

126
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,740
That's America. Can't you like can't stuff be taken care of pretty quickly? I said yeah, absolutely

127
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,160
Is real simple? I'll send you a document one pageer will make it real easy and we're we kind of agree on everything

128
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,780
That's what the crazy thing is and she wants to move on and and of course

129
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,100
I want to move on and there's always that little thing that marriage thing that's hangin in there oops looks like

130
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,040
We just lost the the stream. Oh, okay, maybe it's back. I hope it's back at least

131
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,060
You may have to may have to refresh

138
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,500
Anyway back to the story at hand. We had a great conversation

139
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,740
It was like amazing. You know, it was like it was civil and it was like what and

140
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,420
Just I was just about an hour ago. I just sat down getting ready to do the show and Patricia called me

141
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,500
We had a couple of things to go over mainly about Christina, but again, it was all it was like hello

142
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,500
It was civilized. It was nice. It's like so one puts something in the water and it all it all just kind of fixed itself and

143
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
I can't tell you how happy that makes me

144
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,420
Yes, applause, please for two people being able to figure their shit out. I love it

Far from last night's in the promenade life

152
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,060
While I was like a room man, just a riddest way

153
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,820
I do fucks across the sweet crusty

154
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,620
Speakin' to be with a gentle head in

155
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,340
So I'm not down to under there

156
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
Deep water

157
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,020
I'm cold out of me

158
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
It's cold

159
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,300
If I made over my head

160
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,020
I'd be the left to know

161
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
Ooh

162
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Deep water

163
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,020
And deep water

164
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,020
He closed down the door to the truck of the room

165
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,020
And I came back up and just like the door

166
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,020
Hosted a scatter over the stairs

167
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Nobody reads us alone by the chaos

168
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Jacks are a top with a reach 21 home

169
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,020
So really just ain't my eyes due to fall

170
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Deep water

171
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
I'm cold out of me

172
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
It's cold

173
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,020
If I made over my head

174
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,020
I'd be the left to know

175
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,020
Deep water

176
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,020
And deep water

177
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
And deep water

178
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
And deep water

179
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
And deep water

180
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
And deep water

181
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
And deep water

182
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
And deep water

183
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
And deep water

184
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
And deep water

185
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
And deep water

186
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
And deep water

187
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
And deep water

188
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,020
And deep water

189
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,020
And deep air

190
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
And deep air

191
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
The same heat's been with me

192
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,020
It's now in a pump-each road

193
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I'm so drunk the car won't go

194
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,020
A crazy ask keep looking out to see

195
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Someday drive the cruise and rail

196
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,020
We stayed our own back to town

197
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,020
What do they expect to find?

198
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,020
Short sailing between my mind

199
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Deep water, mine caught up in its floor

200
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,020
If all made over my head

201
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,020
I feel that it's unknown

202
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,020
And deep water

203
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,020
And deep water

204
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:35,020
And deep water

205
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Deep water, I feel that it's unknown

206
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,020
And deep water, I feel that it's unknown

207
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,020
And deep water, I feel that it's unknown

208
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,020
I feel that it's unknown

209
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Honestly, I hadn't really heard of this track before

210
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Or the artist, but apparently as I said, it's a pretty old school stuff from the

211
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,020
Yeah, back in the day from Canada

212
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,020
What do we learn the other day? What do we call them?

213
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Well, yeah, the next one is with sweaters

214
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
We learn how to know a gender

215
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
Well, bring it on guys

216
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
This is kind of stuff you're making up there

217
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
I love it

218
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Awesome

219
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
Deep water

220
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,020
All you charcoal heads out there, up north

221
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,020
So I had a pretty full week, actually

222
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Mainly consisted of being up in San Francisco

223
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Monday and Tuesday

224
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Up at the old, at the old

225
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,020
Meavio HQ, also did an episode of cranky geeks

226
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
I do want to talk about that later

227
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,020
Particularly because of course, we're at the iPad

228
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Launch today and tomorrow

229
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,020
I guess today, officially, but tomorrow everyone gets it

230
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
And whatever

231
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,020
So we'll talk about that

232
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
But probably one of the most exciting things

233
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
I think I told you I had to take the Delta Sierra

234
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,020
My aircraft down to San Jose for its annual

235
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,020
And Wednesday was literally the last day

236
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,020
I could legally fly under its old

237
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
It's old annual

238
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
And if you don't do that then you're grounded

239
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
And you can't fly where you could fly of course

240
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,020
But you could get arrested

241
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,020
By the air cops

242
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,020
But more importantly, your insurance would be invalidated

243
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
So not a good thing

244
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
So I'd captain Dave come up because of course

245
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
I hadn't flown in the airspace

246
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,020
Well, flew a little bit with him in the new

247
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Sessna 210

248
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,020
No, 206, I'm sorry, but the glass cockpit was just amazing

249
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,020
But the last time I had flown the Delta Sierra since

250
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,020
Wow, probably eight or nine months

251
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,020
And it'd been sitting in the hangar at Oakland

252
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
For a good five or six months

253
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Battery was dead

254
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,020
So I had to have the battery replaced

255
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,020
The battery would actually wouldn't even charge anymore

256
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,020
And it was kind of like, wow, you know, here's my old friend, my old pal

257
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,020
My old girl

258
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,020
You know, so got her primed and put a little bit of oil on the

259
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,020
On the heads and on the plugs and made sure everything was all ready to go

260
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,020
And she started right up and she was rare to go

261
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,020
And it was relatively short flight

262
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Only I was at like 22 minutes from Oakland to San Jose

263
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,020
But it was really nice, and you know, and of course when you

264
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,020
Haven't flown an aircraft for a while and it's been just sitting around

265
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Which is probably the worst thing you can do for a

266
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,020
For any airplane

267
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Particularly one that, you know, it's not a brand new one

268
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Although the engine has only had 500 hours and it's, you know, the cats me out

269
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,020
This, you know, it's still in mechanics and it's metal

270
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
And you know, who knows what can happen

271
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,020
So we took off runway 33 with a little bit of tailwind actually

272
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
So took a little bit longer to get airborne

273
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
But perfect left the gear down

274
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Just in case, you know, if we need to go back

275
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,020
We don't want to have to be dealing with lowering the landing gear

276
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Let's just leave the gear down for a couple of minutes

277
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,020
And then as we were ready to make our turn out to the right

278
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,020
And you know, raise the gear, work fine, flew over the mountains

279
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Beautiful, I discovered something amazing

280
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,020
I have a, for those of you who care, I have a

281
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:41,020
A mode S transponder which just just before I left it became law all throughout Europe

282
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Which is the transponder is basically this box that receives a signal from the ground radar stations

283
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,020
And then it actually pings back and says, yeah, I'm receiving your radar

284
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:59,020
But in the United States, if it's properly implemented, it also will alert you to traffic

285
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,020
So the ATC actually said, okay, you've got a assessor, you know, 11 o'clock

286
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,020
He's about 700 feet below us, so no problem

287
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
And the guy basically flew around underneath us

288
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,020
And all it's on here, ding ding traffic traffic

289
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm like, what?

290
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,020
I look at Captain Dave and like, dude, I didn't know there was any traffic

291
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Warning system in the plane, I've had it for a couple of years

292
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,020
And of course, that only works if everything is properly implemented

293
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,020
And I think in class Bravo and Delta airspace in the U.S.

294
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,020
That is implemented certainly in the Bay Area

295
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,020
It's implemented properly, so that was very cool and quite surprising

296
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Made a greaser of a landing, just slid onto the runway

297
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,020
So she's going to get her annual and then of course, I'm going to have to say goodbye to her

298
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
And I've noticed something very interesting

299
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,020
I'm not like Jones and the fly like I used to be

300
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,020
You know, I was like, oh, weekend, I'm going to go somewhere

301
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,020
In the fly, of course, I was never a guy who would just fly around the airfield

302
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,020
Or go get a $20 hamburger as we say

303
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,020
But I'd always want a destination

304
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
And I don't really have a destination

305
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,020
And I have to say that Los Angeles, San Francisco

306
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,020
I mean, you just can't beat Burbank Airport to Oakland with Southwest

307
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
I mean, it's just too way too convenient

308
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,020
Certainly with the speeds the Delta share has

309
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Or anything that doesn't fly at 25,000 feet

310
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,020
So when the TSA is even nice at these smaller airports

311
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
It's quite enjoyable experience

312
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,020
But I think that a lot of it was me just seeking my freedom

313
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,020
And the plane somehow was in escape, you know, just to go up and spread my wings

314
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,020
And essentially, you know, be with the elements

315
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,020
And to some degree, fight the elements, you know, it was something I really needed

316
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
And I feel so different now

317
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,020
And Mickey actually said, you know, this is probably what's going on

318
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
Said, oh, you're so right

319
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,020
You know, it was my liberator, my liberator

320
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
My liberator, my liberation machine

321
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,020
And I feel so liberated right now

322
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
I don't really really need it

323
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
I will get back into flying

324
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,020
I might even pick up rotary again

325
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
We have so many helicopters going by the house

326
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Because we're near the 101 and of course you want to fly over the

327
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,020
The highway in general and also the highest point behind us of the

328
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,020
of the high tension wires is embedded in the hill

329
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,020
And of course as a rotary pilot, don't speak of the devil

330
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Here comes one

331
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,020
As a rotary pilot, you always want to fly over the highest pole

332
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,020
And not, you know, just to stay away from the wires

333
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,020
But anyway, it was great to fly

334
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,020
And to this day I'll say, you know, if it wasn't

335
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,020
For all the other things, I actually do and better at

336
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,020
I wouldn't mind a life of aviation

337
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,020
It's really nice, there's so many nice people in aviation

338
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,020
You get to do, you know, hang out and just, you know, kick tires

339
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,020
And talk airplanes and get your hands greasy and I kind of love it

340
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Whoa!

341
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
He made friends of once and a half

342
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
No right time

343
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
And a black grip on

344
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,020
So people like it, it's a wake up of the fastest guy

345
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
And not

346
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Wake up people

347
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,020
Wake up

348
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Wake up people

349
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Wake up

350
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Wake up people

351
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Wake up

352
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Wake up people

353
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,020
The media has been shooting our slides for years

354
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
But it's like no one can

355
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
Be a condition in the brain

356
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
What's in the desktop in the audience

357
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Where's the sweat?

358
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,020
The government makes it so hot

359
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
A minute to pass the bed

360
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
I don't want to pass the sweat

361
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
I don't want to play

362
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm bored of run

363
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
I've been uniting my town

364
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
You look for some nerve

365
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
A sweat, VVA off the sun

366
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
And real, so what we do first is hear it

367
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
I ain't psyche, I can see the future

368
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
But I don't like it

369
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
This was after those who've been burned

370
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
I don't want to find this

371
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
Wake up people

372
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
Wake up

373
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
Wake up people

374
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
Wake up people

375
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Wake up

376
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
Wake up

377
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
Wake up people

378
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Wake up

379
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
Wake up

380
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Wake up people

381
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Wake up

382
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Wake up

383
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Wake up

384
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,020
Wake up

385
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
Wake up

386
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Wake up

387
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,020
Wake up

388
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,020
Wake up

389
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,140
Hey

390
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,020
Wake up

391
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,020
Wake up

392
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Wake up

393
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Wake up

394
00:26:35,020 --> 00:27:05,020
We come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we

395
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:35,020
come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come,

396
00:27:35,020 --> 00:28:01,860
we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we, come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, we come, We come, we come, we come, we come let's take in a couple minutes to adjust to the accent, get into the vibe but it's an excellent song, DVA featuring Black The Ripper wake up there is also a YouTube video which is outstanding.

397
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,980
This is coming from the London Underground, which I was brought to my attention.

398
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,540
It's actually a damn good documentary about London pirate radio.

399
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,820
It's about 15 minutes.

400
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,580
I'll make sure I put a link to it in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

401
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,900
Crosspostsuititcurry.com.

402
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,700
It's really quite a vibe going on.

403
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:29,540
And although I think that a lot, you know, in the UK, get my nation east as we say,

404
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,940
people still really listen to the radio or the wireless.

405
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,100
And of course, there's a lot of bull crap on.

406
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:44,020
But in London, there is an, there must be 70 or 80 pirate stations at any given time with a limited reach.

407
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,820
And they've gotten quite creative.

408
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,620
And, you know, people still listen to a lot of radio in their cars.

409
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,620
And I think that that, they're kind of on the way of that we're going to get to.

410
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,740
It'll probably happen in the United States earlier where we've got all kinds of streaming audio

411
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,460
in our cars.

412
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,140
And I can't believe I did that.

413
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,980
I closed the mic to burp.

414
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,940
Ah, what a sense.

415
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,140
I missed a good sense.

416
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,780
A moment.

417
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,100
Yeah, there's, uh, it's pretty clear to me.

418
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,980
And to John C. Devoreck as well, that this is where it's headed.

419
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,980
And we're going to have thousands of micro radio stations with varying degrees of audience.

420
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,660
And it's all going to be streamed live.

421
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,020
And I think that, uh, except for China, grove and party.

422
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,020
Well, you know, me, I, I just can't not play some of the older non-pod safe tunes.

423
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,220
But we do have a lot of really good ones that were sent to me that, uh, that without a doubt,

424
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
are, uh, our pod safe.

425
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:49,860
Last night, uh, Mickey and I did something rather, uh, I would say American.

426
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,820
Now, of course, I'm, if anything, I feel like I'm a jersey boy.

427
00:29:53,300 --> 00:30:00,340
And, uh, I remember very well moving into, uh, Montclair New Jersey, uh, technically

428
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,780
for Rona New Jersey, actually.

429
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,140
And I remember the neighbor came over, you know, the kind of the day after we moved in.

430
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,860
And how do you name her?

431
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,500
How are you doing?

432
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,820
And it's so important to have a good relationship with your neighbors.

433
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,500
Now, we're in a very interesting neighborhood up here in the Hollywood Hills.

434
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,620
Uh, it's not a gated community, but, um, you know, without a doubt, it's quiet.

435
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,100
And I said, you know, we really should just go over, uh, uh, let's just go one house at a time,

436
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,780
let's, you know, and because no one had said anything.

437
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,620
And I had the feeling that there were some weird stuff going on in this house,

438
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,980
which we're renting, but I think we're probably going to stay here for a long time,

439
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,620
because it's really, it's a phenomenal place, uh, it's within budget.

440
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,660
And it's, it's just exactly the kind of place we want.

441
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,700
Not huge, but, you know, two bedrooms, which is great, because we have a bedroom, the mommy and daddy room.

442
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,380
And then we have, uh, and Mickey's closet, which used to be a bedroom.

443
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,780
We had closet world come over and, and make it into like one of those sex in the city,

444
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,700
closets that chicks love.

445
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,260
Anyway, so let's just go over. So like, quarter to eight, you know, we go across the way, just ring the doorbell.

446
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,180
And, uh, nice guy opens up and they say, hi, we're Adam and Mickey,

447
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,380
where your neighbors, we just want to say hi, and they just introduce ourselves.

448
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:23,700
And he's like, oh, come on in. And so this is Don, who, uh, who looks, you know, not a day over,

449
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,540
I'd say 50, but he actually turns out to be 60.

450
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,980
And, uh, his partner, Jim, who was about the same age, and, you know, just typical,

451
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:42,260
great California gay guys, you know, immediately bringing out the white wine, they've got the nice

452
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,820
war holes in the house. But the cool thing was, we got a real rundown about the neighborhood

453
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:52,100
and what's going on. And, uh, who's who, and who not even to bother with, you know, they were

454
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:58,660
coaching big time. So here's what I learned. First of all, up the street is, uh, one of the, uh,

455
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:06,020
probably one of the, uh, lesser known and poorer Kardashians, but apparently it's not all that too bad.

456
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,740
There's not not too much ruckus from the, the Kardashian up the street. John legend lives right

457
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:16,500
down the street, which is cool. So I, uh, can't wait to go trick her treating and go around his place.

458
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,700
But most importantly, we learned a lot about this house. And, uh, my, uh, my hunch was right,

459
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,420
as there was kind of a weird guy in here, because I'm still getting mail from, you know, different

460
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:34,660
weird movie companies that, you know, like big deal pictures and, uh, oh, there's been a repo

461
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:42,020
man or two stop by looking to repossess the Bentley. And so I'm like, so tell me about the guy

462
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:48,180
who was here. Well, turns out this house, and I have to do my research, and you know, I will,

463
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,980
has been used quite a bit by vivid entertainment.

464
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:02,740
First take of a revolution son. Oh, yes. We're living in the porn palace, well known from many

465
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:10,500
interesting feature films listed a lot. This is the question that I want to ask you. I've

466
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:20,260
you heard the common color disaster. Yeah, it's clean, the troll coming in faster. Now for the reason

467
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:29,220
that it's telling you, it did the feeling that they want to troll us. We've been seeing the only

468
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:37,300
photos, they keep in secret, saying they're gunning for more trust. Don't sing right,

469
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:52,980
it ain't what to do to the rave, uh, new Johnson. It's shining down on everyone, shining down on

470
00:33:53,060 --> 00:34:09,780
every phone, to the rave, uh, new Johnson, shining down on everyone, shining down on

471
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:21,460
every phone. Yeah, it's clean, the end is coming faster. What would you do on the morning after?

472
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:30,580
We got a fire that puts you calling those bastards, why do you curse us when it isn't for

473
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:44,500
the rave, for the new Johnson. It's shining down on everyone, shining down on everyone,

474
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:59,060
hmm, don't you say, isn't it, don't sin that, if anything, you're awesome, let me

475
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:13,300
go, I'm on the clouds, don't you say, isn't it, don't sin that, do we need more, we need more

476
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:26,980
true soldiers on the ground, rave, uh, new, rave, uh, new, rave, uh, new, rave, uh, new, rave,

477
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:45,620
rave, new, rave, new, rave, new, rave, new, rave, new, rave, new, rave, new on the sun.

478
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Oh yeah, it's clear the end is coming faster.

479
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,820
What would you do on the morning after?

480
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:06,560
We got to find the books you call when we're just bastards, what do you curse when it isn't

481
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
true?

482
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,300
Oh yeah, we all are a bit of revolutions son, I believe that's how do you pronounce

483
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
it?

484
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:22,220
Love that song, and you'll see more of the revolution taking place, stream live, not just at

485
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,820
no agenda stream.com, but there will be many more I can just feel it.

486
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,420
Now sometimes I'm five years ahead of my time, but you know, it'll all catch up eventually.

487
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,980
So anyway, just back to the porn palace, I'm so chaffed.

488
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,180
I'm so happy about this, I told Mickey, I gotta do some research.

489
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,560
I have to find, apparently not just one or two, but quite a few movies I've been

490
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,800
made here.

491
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,620
And when I find them, I will proudly publish them so you can go and take a look at what

492
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,540
the hilltop watch tower looks like.

493
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,820
So anyway, so today is a big day, the Apple iPad has been released, and I wrote a blog

494
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,540
post, which is at meviotech.mevio.com.

495
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,500
We have kind of a cool system now, we're trying to get the whole, actually it's not

496
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,900
even, we don't have to put much effort into it, getting the whole company blogging,

497
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,820
working on, you know, just stuff for all of our channels, and everyone's really into it,

498
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,820
which I like.

499
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,820
And so I sat down and I wrote maybe a, maybe just a tad too long for a blog post, it was

500
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,300
somewhere in between an essay and a blog post about the iPad, my feelings about it.

501
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,300
And, you know, I am far from an Apple fanboy, but I totally love the Mac products and

502
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,100
have used them for 25 years.

503
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:51,220
And I do believe that the iPad is going to be quite a game changer and not just a gigantic

504
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,940
iPod touch or an iPhone without a phone.

505
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,620
And I'll of course I'll put a link in the show notes at dailysourceco.com so you can read

506
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,100
that blog post.

507
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:09,460
But I really was convinced, you know, I've been working on an iPhone app, which I'm going

508
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:17,220
to wait a couple of weeks to release just until the initial iPad noise dies down a bit.

509
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,580
Although now the app that I've made, I will also have to make a version for the iPad.

510
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,020
And it actually, it'll be, although the same completely different.

511
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,300
And I just don't want to tell you what it is yet because when you see it, when you see

512
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,420
this app running on the iPhone, you're going to go, oh, of course, I can't believe no

513
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,660
one did that.

514
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,300
It's going to be free, by the way, so there's no business model behind it, but it does

515
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,860
fit very much in line with what I do and who I am if that gives you any clue.

516
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,700
So it is video heavy.

517
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,060
And one of the reasons why I'd really like what Apple is doing is, you know, I became a developer,

518
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,860
I pay by nine to nine dollars, I downloaded the SDK and it's, I was quite amazed, you know,

519
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:03,980
but what they do with X code, which is their development environment, is, you know,

520
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,860
you fired up and if you can kind of get over the initial shock of a lot of stuff going

521
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:15,460
on here, you find now that you can actually create an iPhone app very quickly, even

522
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,060
one that just says hello world and it will work, you know, so they give you like a great

523
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,060
experience out of the box and you have a little emulator, but you can also put it onto your

524
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,700
iPhone and which is, by the way, it's pretty damn cool, you know, you don't necessarily

525
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,700
have to go through the iTunes store approval process to develop software that you just

526
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,220
want to use on your own device.

527
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,860
I mean, you can put it on your own iPhone, you don't have to release it necessarily, excuse

528
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
me.

529
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,060
And there's a couple of apps that I want to develop.

530
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Here's an example of one.

531
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:53,500
I want to have an app that just checks my followers on Twitter and whenever there's a link

532
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,900
that's included that I like, it will immediately file it for me in the right place through

533
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,900
a number of of steps that I now go through manually.

534
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,020
And of course, I've pretty much learned that the best way to use a computer is to tell

535
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,420
it what to do and take away those repetitive steps that you find yourself doing all the

536
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
time.

537
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,340
For instance, if I find something, I use simply tweet, you know, I click the link, the browser

538
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,340
fires up.

539
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,340
Oh, I want to save that.

540
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,820
So then I have to email it, I have to email it with a certain code, which then I have

541
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,060
to set up a filter for, sort of goes into the right mailbox, I mean, it's just a whole bunch

542
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,180
of steps I have to do, which you know, the iPhone app that I'll develop for myself will

543
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,340
make that much easier.

544
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,220
But I'm getting off the point here.

545
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,820
So in order to go through the iPhone approval process, you have to adhere to the human interface

546
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:54,820
design, what is the actual term, human design guidelines, I think, is what it is,

547
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,380
or human interaction guidelines.

548
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,180
And I think you can deviate a little bit, but in general, that's some really smart stuff.

549
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,420
It's like, okay, here's what people are expecting.

550
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:10,580
We've done all the research, you know, your mileage may vary, but just, you know, if

551
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,820
you kind of make it work like this, when you're doing certain things with, you know, here's

552
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,660
what people expect from a list, here's what people expect from a button, here's what people

553
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,100
expect to see when there's no internet connection, just all these very basic things, then

554
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,620
you'll get it approved.

555
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,820
For video, though, if you want the video to actually work on a 3G network, or as they say

556
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,300
cellular, because of course, you could be in a bad spot, you could have edge only, there's

557
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,020
a number of things that can go wrong, they ask you to adhere to the following, no more

558
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,820
than 10 minutes of video, which is okay, because my, although video heavy, nothing is 10 minutes

559
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:53,540
long, and no more than five megabytes in a five minute period.

560
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:00,820
Now, most of my videos are around eight megs at nice quality, and it's imperative to my app

561
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:06,340
that it has really good quality, you know, at least, so it's not fuzzy or blocky or, or really

562
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:14,340
to compress. So I have a choice to make, either, I scale stuff down and have really been messing

563
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,980
with the settings, you know, dropping the frame rate just a little bit, using different type

564
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,180
of compression settings, I can get most of it around five megs, but of course, each video,

565
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,700
varies and length, and so that's going to be a bit of a challenge, or, and this is what's interesting,

566
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,140
or you have to go to the HTTP live streaming protocol, which means you basically serve up the

567
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:42,580
equivalent of an M3U file, and then the device will actually say, okay, how much bandwidth do I have

568
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,820
available right now? I'll take the high bandwidth version, the medium bandwidth version, or,

569
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,220
and this is kind of the unfortunate part. You are obliged, if you're using the HTTP live streaming

570
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:02,580
protocol, to at least have 164 kilobit, this is what I'm streaming the audio on here today.

571
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,540
So imagine how that's going to be a video 164 kilobit stream, which is total crap,

572
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:14,100
and will not work at all. So although Apple is absolutely right, you're not entirely for the

573
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:20,420
application that I've been working on. So I guess what I'm going to try and do is whittle everything

574
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:29,140
down to around the five megabyte size, yeah, five megabytes in size, and probably trying

575
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:34,660
fits with some of the later videos that don't show up immediately, and hope I kind of slip

576
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:41,300
through the approval process, because I just shutter at the thought of your iPhone deciding that you

577
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:48,340
should have the 64 kilobit video version, which will be crap. They even say, you know, if you can't

578
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,100
get the quality all right, then you should probably just do an audio stream with a picture,

579
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,900
and like, now that's not going to work. So all kinds of challenges, but I think they are the

580
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,700
challenges put in place by Apple for the right reason, and just going through this and the

581
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:08,100
newer SDK for iPhone OS 3.2, I think it is. I'm getting really nerdy, I can't believe that.

582
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:16,020
Which is essentially applicable to the iPad. I think they're going to have some amazing things.

583
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:21,140
Actually, I was having a nice little Twitter chat with Angie B, who had read my column, and I personally

584
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,860
can't wait to manipulate things with my fingers. Angie, if you know what I'm talking about.

585
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,700
Wait a minute, so sorry, didn't mean to do that one, meant to hit this one.

586
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Here we go.

587
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,860
Now, not that one either. I need something to wake up by. Yeah, come on. That's rocket.

588
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,620
Ha, almost forgot it was Friday, I've been talking so much. Wake up everybody.

589
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,740
It's your full-bar Friday, your new mission, 825.

590
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,060
It's your new mission.

591
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,820
And I said, I'm going to work, sleeping in your room.

592
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,300
The power was so close, there was just a bit so far.

593
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:18,180
Well, what am I to believe in? I was thinking if they were going to stand out.

594
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:24,180
That's what I guess was just an outcome of what I did.

595
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:31,060
Here's the girl, last night's the white daylight.

596
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:41,220
But what arms are ever? I try to keep forgetting what I did tonight before.

597
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:48,100
But I can't stop regretting that I slept with her before.

598
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,940
But I tried to share my sorrow with a bottle of booze.

599
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,700
Gotta get rid of yesterday's news.

600
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,740
There can't stop leaving nothing at all.

601
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:08,100
Yeah, why am I to stand out? Oh, why did I kiss that girl last night?

602
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:14,740
Well, the white daylight. But what arms are ever?

603
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,740
Yeah, why am I to stand out?

604
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:28,740
Yeah, why am I to stand out?

605
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:36,740
Yeah, why am I to stand out?

606
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,740
Yeah, why am I to stand out?

607
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,740
But what arms are ever?

608
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:50,740
Just a girl, last night's the white daylight.

609
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:56,740
But what arms are ever? Yeah, why am I to stand out?

610
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,740
Yeah, why am I to stand out?

611
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:23,300
We're special thanks to Mike UC from UC Radio, UC Radio, PodShow, UCRadioPodShow.com for sending

612
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,140
me a couple of tracks for the footballer Friday.

613
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,700
I really love that the Erotic's kids that grow and he's 71 more that I do want to share

614
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
with you.

615
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,340
Of course, the links to all these tracks in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

616
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,620
Hit it, boys!

617
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,620
End of a raster!

Baby, baby!

619
00:47:44,620 --> 00:48:01,580
Let's take a sincere red and I don't want to taste it all.

620
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:01,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

628
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:24,140
yeah it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nothing

629
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,940
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

630
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,940
What I don't promise you I'll drown you crazy

631
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,940
I'll fight it all

632
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,940
Tell me just what you do

633
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,940
What you do

634
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,940
What you do

635
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,940
What you do

636
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,940
I promise you

637
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,940
You won't

638
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,940
Make it all

639
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,940
Love me

640
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,940
There's no way

641
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,940
Oh

642
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,940
Oh yes

643
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,940
Nothing like a big sound from Vegas

644
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,940
And never after

645
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,940
Find them at myspace.com slash and never after

646
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,940
They might as way be one might as well be an L.A. here

647
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,940
This is awesome

648
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,940
Perfect for the football

649
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,940
Nice

650
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,940
Thanks again to Mike UC for setting those tracks over

651
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,940
Time in the show now where

652
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,940
I tell you how you can support this program

653
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,940
And the entire endeavor of no agenda stream.com

654
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,940
Which

655
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,940
John C. Devouric and I are really building up

656
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,940
We're putting a lot of effort into it

657
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,940
He's actually working on a couple of interviews

658
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,940
With some people who are interesting

659
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,940
That you would never hear more than a sound bite from

660
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,940
If that

661
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,940
In the mainstream media

662
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,940
We've got his devouric horror

663
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,940
It's unplugged

664
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,940
We've got some music shows of

665
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,940
Well of course take example here of the

666
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,940
The Daily Source Code

667
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,940
Which is kind of music talk

668
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,940
We've got his interludes and of course no agenda

669
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,940
If you want to support this

670
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,940
Then we would highly appreciate you making a donation

671
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,940
You can go to devouric.org slash n-a-s

672
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,940
November alpha Sierra

673
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,940
And we'll put you up as a sustaining producer

674
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,940
On the page there at no agenda stream.com

675
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,940
That said

676
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,940
We've traditionally had a form of business model

677
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,940
Here on the source code which has been

678
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,940
Essentially codes, marketing codes

679
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,940
For great discounts

680
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,940
Now

681
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,940
I definitely want to support me

682
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,940
Because let's face it

683
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
It's my company

684
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,940
There's like some people working there

685
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,940
Who would like to stay employed

686
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,940
And I'd like to share the opportunity

687
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,940
Because I'll make no money

688
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,940
Certainly not directly

689
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,940
From what I'm about to talk to you about

690
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,940
But I've been talking a lot about

691
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,940
Sis admins and network admins

692
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,940
And I have a feeling that there's a lot of you out there

693
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,940
Who would wow

694
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,940
That's a big one

695
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,940
Another black hawk

696
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,940
I have a feeling that a lot of you

697
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,940
Probably wouldn't mind making some extra cash

698
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,940
And I've got to I want to start off with five

699
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,940
Five Sis admins or network admins

700
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,940
If you want to make some extra money

701
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,940
I've got an idea

702
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,940
So please email me adamantcurry.com

703
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,940
Or perhaps adamantmyvio.com

704
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,940
Curry.com sometimes gets a little clogged up

705
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,940
Still although I've blown out most of the spam wattage

706
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,940
Put in the subject line

707
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,940
DSC Sis opportunity

708
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,940
And I'll get in touch with you

709
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,940
It's a very interesting way to get some extra cash

710
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,940
Which of course you can turn right around

711
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,940
And donate to no agenda stream for all I care

712
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,940
Or just keep it for your own hookers and blow

713
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,940
It's fine whatever you want to do

714
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,940
Now speaking of money

715
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,940
This morning I was watching my favorite morning television station

716
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,940
Yes, I do watch television mainly to find out

717
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,940
What drivel is being fed to us

718
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,940
But there's a station here in Los Angeles

719
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,940
Local station called KTLA

720
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,940
And they have kind of like a morning show

721
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,940
And the reason I watch it is because they always have happy news

722
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,940
They've got some happy going on

723
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,940
It's not all depressing

724
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,940
And there's some puppies born

725
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,940
And it's kind of funny

726
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,940
I like that

727
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,940
Just give me something like drively

728
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,940
And smiley in the morning

729
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,940
I also know

730
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,940
Michaela who I think is one of the anchors of that show

731
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,940
She used to be, I think I'm tech TV

732
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,940
In the evening on KTLA

733
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,940
There's

734
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,940
I know people from the station I've been on the show

735
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,940
That's unbelievable

736
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,940
What is going on?

737
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,940
Look guys, I'm not even

738
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,940
No agenda time, no need to fly around

739
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,940
So I'm watching this show this morning

740
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,940
And I forget the name of the actress who comes on

741
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,940
Let me see if I can find it here on the website

742
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,940
Gosh, what was her name?

743
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,940
Hold on a second

744
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,940
You would expect it to be

745
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,940
It was beautiful

746
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,940
How typical was that of me?

747
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,940
Not to remember her name

748
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,940
Anyway

749
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,940
Her whole pitch was to help the people in Haiti

750
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,940
Now if you've listened to No Agenda

751
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,940
Then you know that I believe this is a total

752
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,940
Hostile takeover of the country

753
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,940
We've got the Clintons in there

754
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,940
There's $11 billion being invested

755
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,940
By the United Nations and the World Bank and private investors

756
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,940
Essentially to turn the country into a tax haven

757
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,940
A casino paradise

758
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,940
I'm sure there's going to be a Bill Clinton Avenue

759
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,940
With lots of tall buildings named after him in the Hillary

760
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,940
And it's their scumbags, all of them

761
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,940
Just totally raping this country

762
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,940
And so you think that you donated money to

763
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,940
ClintonBush for Haiti.org

764
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,940
Well, no such organization exists

765
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,940
That money is shuddle directly through to the William Jefferson Clinton

766
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,940
William Jefferson Clinton Foundation

767
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,940
And George Bush's Texas Foundation

768
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,940
Which has like $800 million in cash

769
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,940
And stocks and bonds

770
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,940
They make all kinds of money

771
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,940
Off of your money

772
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,940
And they've been doming out the money

773
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,940
Clinton by his own admission

774
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,940
Ray is like 14 million that came in

775
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,940
He's only dished out 3 million to a whole bunch of other organizations

776
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,940
So basically it's crap

777
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,940
They're stealing your money

778
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,940
Not giving it to Haitians

779
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,940
And all I see on TV if you see it

780
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,940
You can certainly get the reports

781
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,940
People don't even have tents yet

782
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,940
It's like oh yeah

783
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,940
It's red tape and bull crap

784
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,940
They don't give a shit

785
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,940
They want these people to die

786
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,940
They want them out of the way

787
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,940
Like just bulldozeem

788
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,940
So this is a home in Haiti.org

789
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,940
Again, a home in Haiti.org

790
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,940
Which is a really good idea

791
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,940
Which I like a lot is buy a tent

792
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,940
And then this organization will make sure that it actually gets to them

793
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,940
Now if you look at the website

794
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,940
We'll see how they do it

795
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,940
And they actually you don't buy a tent from them

796
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,940
They have links to tents on amazon.com

797
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,940
And they give you the shipping address

798
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,940
Which is I believe in Atlanta

799
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,940
And from Atlanta they take them over to Florida

800
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,940
From Florida they basically have to sneak them into Haiti

801
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,940
And this is what these people really need

802
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,940
Hey, babe

803
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,940
This is what these people really really need

804
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,940
If you see they still got like sheets

805
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940
And crap strung up

806
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,940
And there's hundreds of thousands of people homeless

807
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,940
And none of this money is getting to them

808
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,940
We have 20,000 troops on the streets in Haiti

809
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,940
It's a total scam

810
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,940
Total scam

811
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,940
It just pisses me off to no end

812
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,940
So angry about what happened here

813
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,940
And we've been on it the whole time

814
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,940
I know agenda

815
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,940
Just tell you this is a rip off

816
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,940
One devourack was a quick-to-paray me agrees

817
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,940
So take a look at what these guys are doing

818
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,940
And by a tent

819
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,940
And Mickey by the way we bought a bungalow tent

820
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,940
Yeah

821
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,940
Not for us

822
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,940
No for the people of someone in Haiti

823
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,940
It's for us

824
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,940
What?

825
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,940
I'll take you camping in Haiti

826
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,940
It could be fun

827
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,940
If we bought a bungalow tent

828
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,940
So please consider buying a tent

829
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,940
It's a great idea

830
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,940
I really like this

831
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,940
They also have a Twitter account

832
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,940
At home in Haiti

833
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,940
So it's at at home

834
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,940
At a home in Haiti

835
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,940
And it's www.ahomein Haiti.org

836
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,940
And I will also mention this

837
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,940
I know agenda

838
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,940
Which I'm sure by now has a much bigger audience

839
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,940
than daily source code

840
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,940
I should actually look at the stats

841
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,940
It's nice to see that

842
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,940
I think there was an immediate 25,000 downloads of the show

843
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,940
When the first one came back

844
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,940
I haven't looked since then

845
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,940
Because I really don't care

846
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,940
It's the people who show up who I care about

847
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,940
That's really what it's all about

848
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,940
So get those guys a look

849
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,940
I think they're doing a pretty good job

850
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,940
One more track before we go and

851
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,940
Turn me home

852
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,940
I find the frequency

853
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,940
It isn't what you need

854
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,940
It's what you have

855
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,940
Less than everyone

856
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,940
And understand

857
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,940
And we want to fade to away

858
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,940
In a power dodge

859
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,940
See their laughs again

860
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,940
And other grunts

861
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:03,940
Staying

862
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,940
You stay on the phone

863
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,940
Into my eyes

864
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,940
Staying in the air

865
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,940
You're in your eyes

866
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,940
You're in your eyes

867
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,940
You're in your eyes

868
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,940
It isn't how you're seen

869
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,940
And people's eyes

870
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,940
This is the spirit of our times

871
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,940
We've all gathered key

872
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,940
To a better life

873
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,940
To get it open to your sight

874
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,940
You're in your eyes

875
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,940
Staying in the air

876
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:58,940
You're in your life

877
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,940
From it to my eyes

878
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,940
Staying in the air

879
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,940
You're in your eyes

880
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,940
See their laughs again

881
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,940
You're in your eyes

882
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,940
Staying in the air

883
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:45,940
You're in your eyes

884
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,940
You're in your eyes

885
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,940
Staying in the air

886
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:58,940
You're in your eyes

887
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:24,940
Staying in the air

888
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,940
You're in your eyes

889
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,940
Staying in the air

890
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,940
Jeremy Roe

891
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,940
I find a frequency

892
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,940
Repping up

893
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,940
Charlie 825

894
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:51,940
Super Friday Edition

895
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,940
Thank you everybody

896
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,940
No agenda chat.com for 200 news

897
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,940
Well it's no agenda stream.com

898
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,940
All the show notes and daily source code.com

899
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,940
Until we speak again

900
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,940
Which of course will be Sunday for the no agenda early morning service

901
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,940
And Wednesday for another Charlie as far as I can plan it until then

902
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,940
Leave your life with passion

903
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,940
And while it lasts

904
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,940
Enjoy your freedom

905
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,940
Another fine, medium presentation

906
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,940
Stick it in your ear
