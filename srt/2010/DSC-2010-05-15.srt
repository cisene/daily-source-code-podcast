00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Delta Sierra Charlie, 8-3-2 the Snapfoo Saturday Edition.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,440
We'll 16-0 in Sysad minutes, ensuring 5-9's up-time turn.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,440
The 21st century of radio stars here.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
We don't need us.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,440
We can't hear the meaning of life.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,440
I know it's in the strength I care.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm testing.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
It's Adam Curry.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Well, I'm half-blotted.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Can't get to see.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,440
I gotta pay the level of a hundred free.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,440
Come on, baby.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
You're doing all the best.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm half-blotted.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
I'm half-blotted.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
You don't have to read my mind.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
To know what I have in mind.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Honey, you don't know.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
Now you move so fine.

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Let me lay it on the line.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,440
I want to know what you're doing.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,440
And to the show.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Now it's up to you.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,440
We can make a secret running through.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
Just me and you.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,440
That's going to love it like you never do.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,440
That's why I'm half-blotted.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Can't get to see.

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,440
I gotta pay the level of a hundred free.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Come on, baby.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
You're doing all the best.

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm half-blotted.

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
I'm half-blotted.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
It feels alright.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Maybe you can't stay all night.

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Shall I leave you my key?

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,440
What you've got to give me the sign?

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Oh no, I've got the sign.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Tell me, are you half-mom?

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
You sure look that way to me.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Are you moving now?

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Will you be ready when I call your love?

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Is my timing right?

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
It's like you're love me tonight.

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Yeah, I'm half-blotted.

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Can't get to see.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Feel a bit of burning inside of me.

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Come baby, you're doing all the best.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm half-blotted.

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I'm half-blotted.

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I'm half-blotted.

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Say hello to my little friend.

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm a carry.

54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm a daily source call.

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm half-blotted.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Now it's up to you.

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Can we make a secret run?

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Yeah, we'll make a secret run, yeah, we'll make a secret run.

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Now it's up to you.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,440
You'll have to get away from you, no?

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440
I'm half-blotted.

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Can't get to see.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Gotta be, though, a hundred and three.

64
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Come home baby, you're doing all the best.

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,040
Hot blood and hot blood and every night

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Oh yeah, hot blood and you're looking so tight

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Hot blood and I can tell that you're alive

68
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Hot blood and hot blood and hot blood

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Hot blood and I, it's day of source code episode 832

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Coming to you from the hilltop watch tower crackpot command center

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
And the people's Republic of Southern California

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,440
This is of course a snap-oocider edition

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,440
So a little bit lower key than a football Friday, but still

74
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Enough tunes to keep your rockers

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Small jeans, genius, my cough, I've seen it

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Strong out of lasers, slash back lasers

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Ain't all your razors while pulling the waders

78
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Talking about non-roll, your kin's no way

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,440
New y'all so go go and everything tastes nice

80
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
All in a greening

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Get back to it

82
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Ging, genius, my cough, I've seen it

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Strong out of lasers, slash back lasers

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Ging, genius, my cough, I've seen it

85
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh

86
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
It's like a man, but smiles like a reptile

87
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
She loved him, she loved him

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
But just more short while

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Stretching the sand, let's go and his hand

90
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,440
To set the easy addition

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Sales you nutrition, keep on your den-herfer

92
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Making a bummed web

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
All the greenies

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
The ginger in it lives on his back

95
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,440
The ginger in it loves Jesus' accent

96
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
His hands ain't as he spins on him all

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,440
The ginger in it lets us out go

98
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Away from him

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Swish him while grinding

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Can't drive his mouth full

101
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Like summoning an author and sleeping and capture

102
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Gosh, you still calm

103
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
A lot swim endarl

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:08:17,440
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.Image, we didn't

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I have now hooked up the old rack as everything arrived from the United Kingdom up David.

107
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Taken home.

108
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Yeah, so I spent most of yesterday, hooking everything up, no longer am I running through

109
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,440
all the digital stuff that crunches the sound and is so incredibly dangerous because when

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
the Mac crashes, then you can lose pretty much everything.

111
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Although this is technically still a test and we've got a couple of people in the chat room who

112
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,440
already agreed to record the stream just in case the recording messes up.

113
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
And I need a backup of the show, at least it'll be available.

114
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
So my stuff arrived from the United Kingdom earlier this week.

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
It arrived in lots of boxes.

116
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,440
It was packed without a lot of love as you can perhaps imagine if you know some of the

117
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
backstory.

118
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,440
The shit was literally just thrown into boxes and the worst part was the wires.

119
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,440
When you have a studio and you got a rack full of gear, there's a lot of patch cables,

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,440
power cables and it was just basically one big bunch of spaghetti.

121
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Miss Mickey spent about an hour and a half last night with me untangling everything.

122
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
And I kept going, oh yes, this is a great find.

123
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
This is an awesome cable.

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Yeah, this is exactly the one I need.

125
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
And of course you never really have enough and you know your brain is just overloaded

126
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
thinking about how to set it up so that everything works and I need to

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,440
know what's known as a mix minus through Skype.

128
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,440
So I can talk to John in the morning and do that perfectly and have it here everything

129
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
except himself.

130
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
No echoes.

131
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,440
For those of you who have done any type of broadcasting or podcasting, you know what I'm

132
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
talking about.

133
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,440
And of course, I have like four or five microphones.

134
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
My favorite one, the high LPR 40 was broken.

135
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I hooked it up and I just couldn't figure out why the sound was all crappy.

136
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
And then eventually I just did a direct input into the mix and like, oh okay, this thing

137
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
just shit the bed probably because of the way it was packed or the lack of packing for

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
that reason.

139
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
And I got it all hooked up last night.

140
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I will be taking some more pictures explaining exactly what I've got.

141
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I've got quite a nice little chain of stuff.

142
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,440
What was funny though, so I had it all hooked up around 1130 p.m.

143
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
This Mickey had gone off to bed.

144
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,440
And I was just working on it and said, why am I supposed to try and figure out

145
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
some of the stream stuff and see if I can get everything to work.

146
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,440
But this time I'd popped open a gray goose.

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,440
And as most of you all know, I'm not really a drinker.

148
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm certainly an amateur.

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,440
So I drink a glass and I am completely hammered.

150
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
And I'm on the stream is like six people listening.

151
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
I think Void Zero was in the chat room in Mr. Oil.

152
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
And I was just playing songs.

153
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,440
And if anyone ever recorded that, it could be used against me.

154
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Oh boy.

155
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
So I needless to say, I'm hurting just a little bit this morning.

156
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,440
But I do want to bring you a full on food bars, full on snafu Saturday.

157
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,440
And of course, as a part of what arrived in the boxes from London

158
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,440
is not just my gear, not just my wires.

159
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
But, haha.

160
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Yes, you'll recognize that, don't you?

161
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,440
So I think we need to celebrate the facts that the cowbell is back.

162
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Are you ready?

163
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,440
It means more cowbell!

164
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,440
We'll be able to fly.

165
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,440
We'll be able to fly.

166
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

167
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:53,440
And of course, it's a good year for the cowbell.

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,440
So I don't want you to be myself,

169
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Show me your hands really yet

170
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I'll do it together and it'll hurt us too

171
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440

208
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,380
Oh, let's chill out with a little bit of ELO.

209
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:17,380
You do believe, you are in higher and higher, baby.

210
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,380
It's a living thing.

211
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,380
It's a terrible thing to lose.

212
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,380
It's a given thing.

213
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,380
What a terrible thing to lose.

214
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:56,380
I can't believe this is what you could see from your worst day.

215
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
I'm taken, I'm alive.

216
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,380
I'm moving in life and you live back in time to the first day.

217
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
I'm taken, I'm taken.

218
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,380
You, I'm just with the side.

219
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Don't you do it, don't you do it.

220
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,380
Higher and higher, baby.

221
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,380
It's a living thing.

222
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,380
It's a terrible thing to lose.

223
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,380
It's a given thing.

224
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,380
What a terrible thing to lose.

225
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,380
It's a given thing.

226
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Oh, let's chill out with a little bit of ELO.

227
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,380
It's a given thing.

228
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
It's a given thing.

229
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
It's a given thing.

230
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
It's a given thing.

231
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
It's a given thing.

232
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
It's a given thing.

233
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,380
It's a given thing.

234
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,380
It's a given thing.

235
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,380
It's a given thing.

236
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
It's a given thing.

238
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
It's a given thing.

239
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
It's a given thing.

240
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
It's a given thing.

241
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
It's a given thing.

242
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,380
It's a given thing.

243
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
It's a given thing.

244
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
It's a given thing.

245
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,380
It's a terrible thing to lose.

246
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,380
It's a given thing.

247
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,380
What a terrible thing to lose.

248
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,380
I had kind of been epiphany while I was setting everything up yesterday.

249
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Last night really.

250
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
God, it sounds so good.

251
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,380
It's almost like when you are listening to MP3's most of your life.

252
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,380
And then all of a sudden you hear a CD on a real good sound system.

253
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Better yet you hear someone playing live.

254
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,380
You're like, oh, that's what I've been missing all this time.

255
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,380
I don't know, it's just like all of a sudden everything's opened up.

256
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
The song sound better and everything,

257
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,380
who knows, maybe it was the Grey Goose, I don't know.

258
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Wow.

259
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,380
It's interesting to see what's happening this morning.

260
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,380
Let's turn on the news.

261
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,380
Let's get an overview of what's happening in the world.

262
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,380
And not really getting an overview of what's happening in the world.

263
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,380
All I see is basically two things.

264
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:38,380
One, everybody in Europe has two implement austerity measures.

265
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,380
austerity, I think is a different word for slave.

266
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,380
And of course, there's still this golf oil thing going on.

267
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm pretty sure we'll talk about that in the morning tomorrow for early morning service.

268
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,380
But wow, and this is something I won't bring up on the show tomorrow.

269
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,380
But it seems like the stuff that we've been talking about.

270
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Certainly for the past two, maybe no, actually two and a half almost three years.

271
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,380
That finally, they're getting their way.

272
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,380
And looks like the banks are going to have total control of everything.

273
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,380
Total control of all governments, all political decisions that are made.

274
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,380
And we're, I feel like we're moving towards the, and

275
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
God, we've talked about it so much.

276
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,380
Towards the, you know, the one world bank solution, which of course is no different from the one world government.

277
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
And that'll be very interesting to see what happens.

278
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,380
I just been watching the euro, man.

279
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
It was like 135 a couple weeks ago.

280
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Now it's like 126, 127 things just tankin.

281
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:55,380
Was it now 700 billion euros has to be set aside in a separate fund for all the problems that are expected.

282
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,380
I'm sure it's going to be 10 times that.

283
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,380
And well, this can only lead to one thing.

284
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,380
That is the complete removal of money as we know it.

285
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,380
And we'll all be using debit cards and credit cards and all kinds of weird stuff.

286
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,380
And we'll be paying carbon taxes probably directly to the banks.

287
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:20,380
And it was Sammy Hagar, who sang about this a while ago when he was in Montrose number those guys.

288
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,380
It's by the way, is another cowbell song.

289
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,380
But I'll lay back a little bit on that.

290
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
It's called Paper Money.

291
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
It's on the source code A32.

292
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Play a game of a rich boy.

293
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,380
I buy everything I can.

294
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,380
My main role is a fun thing.

295
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,380
I'm a wealthy man.

296
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:51,380
A million dollars of note is right there in my hand.

297
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,380
And I can't stand the thing.

298
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Well, it's all that I've got.

299
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Take away all my silver love.

300
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,380
Take away all my gold.

301
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,380
And hand me a stack of paper.

302
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Paper money.

303
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Paper money, don't hold on.

304
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,380
Paper money, don't hold on.

305
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Well, you're acting so you don't remember.

306
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,380
We're all used to be.

307
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Now, what man he likes of the money?

308
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,380
And the man holds a key.

309
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:55,380
A million dollars of note is right there in my hand.

310
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,380
I can't stand the thing.

311
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Well, it's all that I've got.

312
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,380
Take away all my silver love.

313
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Take away all my gold.

314
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,380
And hand me a stack of paper.

315
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,380
Paper money, paper money, don't hold on.

316
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,380
Paper money, don't hold on.

317
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Paper money, don't hold on.

318
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,380
My car costs me 15 grand.

319
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,380
So I'm saying I got a deal.

320
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,380
Now, the dollar got a thousand pounds of junk.

321
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,380
Ten dollars worth of steel.

322
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,380
A million dollars of note is right there in my hand.

323
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,380
And I can't stand the thing.

324
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Well, it's all that I've got.

325
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Sorry.

326
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,380
Take away all my silver love.

327
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Take away all my gold.

328
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,380
And me a stack of paper.

329
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:09,380
But paper money, paper money, don't hold on.

330
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Paper money, don't hold on.

331
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,380

490
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,580
it's two of my favorite bands, it's I-Fight Dragons doing a cover of Weezer, a Y-Bother.

491
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,800
They somehow turned, I thought that most of this rack gear is equipment pretty much

492
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:35,220
was dual voltage so that it would do both 220, where I use most of it, and 110 volts.

493
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,660
Only one of them actually was dual voltage, so I took a trip out to fries yesterday, which

494
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,420
was really nice.

495
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,940
For those of you who don't know, fries is without a doubt the nerd heaven of electronics,

496
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,020
computers, and gear, and I was able to acquire a step up converter.

497
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,100
I knew that you could convert down from 220 to 110 volts, but I didn't know that there

498
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:06,580
were such reasonably affordable transformers available for a step up from 110 to 220.

499
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,500
And so actually the way it works now is there's one chord going into the wall out

500
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,300
left that goes into this thousand watt transformer, and then it's plugged straight into

501
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:22,540
that, is a UK plug, one of those crazy ones, the big three-prong monster with the fuse in it,

502
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,260
and then that goes into a strip, a UK strip, and from there on out, it's pretty much a

503
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
cheap, more nation-east, baby.

504
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:36,100
The bottom of the airways is landed, and he's sounding good to me.

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:52,860
Oh yeah, the message.

507
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,860
Change your pace, the source code.

508
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

509
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

510
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

511
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:20,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

512
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

513
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

514
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:47,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

515
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,860
Oh, Adam, let's start the dance.

516
00:34:50,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

517
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

518
00:35:50,860 --> 00:36:19,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and okay just makzak and

519
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:56,300
Oh, that's a good one.

520
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Oh, that's a good one.

521
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Oh, that's a good one.

522
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Oh, that's a good one.

523
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Oh, that's a good one.

524
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Oh, that's a good one.

525
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,300
All's in make sure that I move down

526
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,300
The heart of the blood is in your head

527
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,300
The heart of the blood is in your head

528
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,300
The heart of the blood is in your head

529
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,300
The heart of the blood is in your head

530
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,300
The heart of the blood is in your head

531
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:21,300
You can take back to the bank

532
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:29,300
Go team our search and rescue team

533
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,440
We just need cash. I know a lot of people want to send blankets or water

534
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Just in your cash

535
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm talking to you. Get up and shout.

536
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:56,100
There's no hate in the name. Hey, watch your whole night out.

537
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:04,100
I'm talking to the music.

538
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm talking to the music.

539
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:18,100
Oh, I got it. Tell me about you. Hey.

540
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Oh. Hey, shout.

541
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
Oh, baby.

542
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,100
In 1965, Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war, but it wasn't.

543
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,100
It was different many ways, and so were those who did the fighting.

544
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,100
In World War II, the average age of the combat soldier was 26.

545
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
In Vietnam, he was 19.

546
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,100
In Vietnam, he was 19.

547
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,100
In Vietnam, he was 19.

548
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Not not not 19.

549
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,100
I haven't just fighting in the past two weeks.

550
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,100
I knew it today, 25 miles from West to Saigon.

551
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I was really sure what was going on.

552
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:16,100
In Vietnam, the combat soldier typically served at 12 months or a duty.

553
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,100
But the exposed hostile fire almost every day.

554
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like

555
00:40:50,100 --> 00:41:15,100
like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like that.

556
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:21,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

557
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:30,100
They also have a combat in Vietnam.

558
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:45,860
According to a veteran's administration's study, half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffer

559
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:52,140
from what psychiatrists call post-traumatic stress disorder, many vets complain of alienation, rage,

560
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,140
or guilt, some succumb to suicidal thoughts.

561
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,100
This is one legacy of the Vietnam War.

562
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,100
They fought the longest war in American history.

563
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,100
None of them received a hero's welcome.

564
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:36,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

565
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:42,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

566
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:48,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

567
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:54,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

568
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:00,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

569
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

570
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

571
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:14,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

572
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:20,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

573
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:34,100
This is the story of men who are victims of war.

574
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:42,100
Almost 800,000 men are still fighting the Vietnam War.

575
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:49,100
Quite amazing how little we have learned since the song came out in the early 80s.

576
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Paul Hardcastle, one of the plethora of mixes available of the track boy.

577
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
What a super smash that was.

578
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,100
I love watching the chat room to see the conversation that goes on during every single song.

579
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,100
The music can say so much, it can mean so much.

580
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,100
That was the fallout from the Vietnam War.

581
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Long of course, but now is outdated because the wars we are fighting now in Iraq and Afghanistan are by definition now.

582
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,100
The longest wars the United States has ever fought.

583
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,100
Of course, no one really knows why we're there.

584
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
We're still trying to figure that one out.

585
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
It's a big game.

586
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
There's a lot of players.

587
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,100
We are not players in that game.

588
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Of course, the average age of the Vietnam is probably 18 and not 19.

589
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Just to show you how, as time progresses, things actually go backwards.

590
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Tomorrow night, we'll be the final episode of the Pacific on HBO.

591
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,100
I don't know if you've been following that or not.

592
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:54,100
I have my grandfather was in the state, was the tenant commander in the Navy and the South Pacific.

593
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,100
I think in this final episode we're going to see exactly the same thing.

594
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,100
Traumatic, you know, post-traumatic stress disorder.

595
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:09,100
No jobs, people being people who fought under the guise of freedom.

596
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Who were brainwashed into doing that and did it for no other motives than purely patriotic.

597
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,100
Are just shunned.

598
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:22,100
We're seeing now record number of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan committing suicide.

599
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,100
Six thousand in this past year alone.

600
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Six thousand.

601
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,100
Sometimes things are so wrong.

602
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,100
And then again, when I look at myself, I think cranky.

603
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I got nothing to complain about.

604
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,100
And all you have to do is listen to a song like that and think to yourself,

605
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,100
shit.

606
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,100
Life's pretty good for me.

607
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,100
In fact, it's been pretty good to me so far.

608
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,100
Count my blessings every morning.

609
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,100
I wake up.

610
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,100
And I actually open my eyes and I'm awake and I'm still alive.

611
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,100
It's nice and sunny and Southern California.

612
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
We got Joe Walsh on the Charlie.

613
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,100
Eight, three, two.

614
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,100
One, two, three.

615
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,100

One, two, three.

618
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
One, two, three.

619
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
One, two, three.

620
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
One, two, three.

621
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,100
One, two, three.

622
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,100
One, two, three.

623
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,100
One, two, three.

624
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,100
One, two, three.

625
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
One, two, three.

626
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
One, two, three.

627
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,100
One, two, three.

628
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,100
One, two, three.

629
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
One, two, three.

630
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,100
One, two, three.

631
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,100
One, two, three.

632
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,100
Two, three.

633
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Two,三.

634
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Two, six, four.

635
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,100
One, two.

636
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,100
Two, three.

637
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,100
One, two, three.

638
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
One, two, three.

639
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,100
Two, three.

640
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,100
One, two, three.

641
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,100
One, two, three.

642
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
One, two, three.

643
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
One, two, three.

644
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,100
one, two, three.

645
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,100
One, two, three.

646
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Two, three.

647
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
Two, three.

648
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
One, two, three.

649
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Who's at the scene of the crime, life's been good to me

650
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,100
So long

651
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
My mother, right?

652
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,100
It was 185

653
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,100
I lost my license

654
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,100
Now I don't drive

655
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,100
I have a little road

656
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
Right in the back

657
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,100
I left the doors

658
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,100
In the case I'm attacked

659
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
Now I keep records

660
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,100
My fans they can't wait

661
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
They run me letters

662
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,100
Tell me I'm great

663
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,100
So I got me an office

664
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,100
Go records on the wall

665
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
Just leave a message

666
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,100

00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,100
I can't complain

960
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:59,600
See, you never hear that party either, because then have to break for commercial halfway

961
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
through.

962
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:13,220
A flock of whale ass, I think there's more on this, ah, that dude was smoking something good

963
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,220
wasn't he?

964
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:32,860
Oh man, ah, I love him, ah, I hold on a second, this is another, ah, this is actually

965
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:39,420
coming from a video that I found online, actually so I think someone sent this to me, it's

966
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:46,060
a great piece by the fantastic George Carlin who, ah, unfortunately is no longer with

967
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,060
us.

968
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,020
Oh man, did that guy have a lot of shit straight, did he know exactly what was going on?

969
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:57,900
And this I think is from an interview where he talks about, well, people like, certainly

970
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,400
like me and maybe like you.

971
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,820
You know, if I had to say to you, what is the answer?

972
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,380
I would say massive bloodshed, I really would.

973
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,460
I don't really, honestly, deep down, believe in political action.

974
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,940
I think the system contracts and expands as it wants to, it accommodates these changes.

975
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,820
I think the civil rights movement was an accommodation on the part of the, those who own

976
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,820
the country.

977
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,700
I think they see where their self-interest lies.

978
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:27,700
They see a certain amount of freedom seems good, an illusion of liberty, give these people,

979
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,820
give these people a voting day every year so that they'll have the illusion of meaningless

980
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,820
choice.

981
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:37,860
Meaningless choice that we go, like slaves and say, George, I voted, they, the limits

982
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:43,300
of debate in this country are established before the debate even begins and everyone else

983
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,100
is marginalized and made to see me there to become units or some sort of disloyal person

984
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,100
a cook.

985
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:54,540
There's a word and now it's conspiracy, they've made that, something that should not

986
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:59,780
be even entertained for a minute that powerful people might get together and have a plan.

987
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,860
Doesn't happen, you're a cook, you're a conspiracy buff.

988
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:09,900
So the only way you cure that death bloodshed, I don't advocate it, but I see that it's

989
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
really the only answer.

990
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,540
And of course, in your words.

991
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,540
Yeah.

992
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:18,580
And I think Greece is, under that, I think they've figured it out.

993
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,620
Unfortunately, I heard another bomb went off in Greece this morning, we're going to see

994
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:28,740
a lot more crap coming down, but at least we've got the tunes, we've got each other,

995
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,260
and we're all connected virtually speaking.

996
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,460

998
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:46,660

1001
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:21,460
He comes down, yellow mountain, on a dark, flat land she writes, on a pony she

1002
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:36,980
in wild fire, when the world went by her side, on a comb of rest her night.

1003
00:57:36,980 --> 00:58:04,460
Oh, they say she died one winter, when there came a killing frost, and the pony

1004
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:26,980
she named wild fire busted down a stall, and a Blizzard he was lost, she ran calling wild fire,

1005
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:54,940
she ran calling wild fire, she ran calling wild fire, by the dark as a moon, I planted

1006
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:09,380
her hair, but there came an early snow, there's been a hoot out here and by my winter now,

1007
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:31,620
for six nights in a row, she's coming from me and no, and the wild fire will be riding wild

1008
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:52,860
weather riding wild fire will be riding wild fire on wild fire, we're gonna ride her, we're gonna leave

1009
00:59:52,860 --> 01:00:22,860
her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna leave her, we're gonna

1010
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:52,860
go ahead of funny, I've got a number of command line windows open here on the dual monitor, I always log in to noagendachat.com, of course, I have a Twitter window, and also because I'm always interested in what they're talking about over there, the Twit Chat, if you look at this, actually I'll take a picture right now. So, they're talking about gadgets over there on Twitter, I see, Olivia, I see, Perez, Hilton saying,

1011
01:00:52,860 --> 01:01:00,860
And of course the real conversation is happening at no agenda chat dot com boy, there's a lot of craziness

1012
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:07,860
You know, it's so easy for us to just put our heads in the sand nothing about it think about the coolest new gadget or

1013
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,860
What does he joy be hard talk about the other day. Oh, yes porn for women

1014
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,860
And what am I saying that that's actually pretty good topic

1015
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,860
Comic strip

1016
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,860
Comic strip

1017
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,860
Oh, yes, how are we doing in the European Union my friend?

1018
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:38,860
Oh, Adam. Yes, what he box is carry is so this is be he is picking a European Union correspondent

1019
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:45,860
Yes, Ireland so Ireland Spain and Greece are cutting spending and the euro currency that seems to be safe

1020
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,860
Well, it's not really cutting spending. It's making the people pay for

1021
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:54,860
I believe at least stealing the money

1022
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,860
Taking government money putting into projects that nobody needed and we're failing

1023
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,860
And Adam, do you remember this ribbon throw up a lot of back?

1024
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:07,860
Yes, we talked about this this of course the new one now is Russia and

1025
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:15,860
And Germany bypassing Poland. Yes, aware of it. Well, apart from the Soviet Russia invading Poland at the same time as

1026
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:21,860
In 1989 from the East it also invaded Estonia and we're taking a stonial

1027
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:27,860
The stonial is a high-tech small country. This is joining you occur in the next year in January

1028
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:31,860
So Estonia is a neighbor of Finland and

1029
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:37,860
Finns were going and are going to Estonia for many many years for cookies and blogs

1030
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,860
I think and I'm not kidding

1031
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,860
So you see Adam you are is not lost yet

1032
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,860
You're right. No, there's still good stuff happening in Europe. Obviously in Estonia

1033
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,860
Maybe John and I should do a little road trip

1034
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,860
Time to crank up the moon a little bit

1035
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,860
Forsells out of that depressing thoughts

1036
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,860
With a little bit of funky Miller

1037
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,860
Make up to yourself who say good back touch me deep inside

1038
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,860
Baby, I hope it's not fair

1039
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:35,860
You can count on me when it's a friend you need

1040
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,860
All the same

1041
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,860
I hope it all goes well

1042
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:46,860
Now be good to yourself every day and every night

1043
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,860
This is a summer girl to be in the band of children

1044
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:57,860
Be true to one another till your dying day

1045
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,860
Near the sunshine down your way

1046
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,860
Yeah

1047
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:09,860
You know the times we have been far from bad

1048
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,860
And I hope it come together once again

1049
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,860
But until that day

1050
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,860
You just say good back

1051
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,860
I'll remember you till the very end

1052
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,860
Be true to yourself

1053
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,860
Every day and every night

1054
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,860
It's a summer girl to be in the band of children

1055
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:42,860
Be true to one another till your dying day

1056
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,860
Near the sunshine down your way

1057
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,860
Baby, I hope it all goes well

1058
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:18,860
Keep going to your safe every day and every night

1059
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:23,860
This is a summer girl to be in the band of children

1060
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,860
Be true to one another

1061
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,860
Until your dying day

1062
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,860
Near the sunshine down your way

1063
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:44,860
You can count on me when it's a summer girl to be in the band of children

1064
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,860
Be true to one another till your dying day

1065
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,860
Near the sunshine down your way

1066
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,860
Funky fucking Miller

1067
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,860
Be true to yourself on the Charlie episode

1068
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,860
A 32 the snuff from Saturday edition

1069
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,860
And hour and five minutes into the show

1070
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:07,860
And still plenty of tracks to go

1071
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,860
And we got great on the Charlie coming up

1072
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,860
I'd say about another half hour if you don't mind hanging out

1073
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,860
Theujenestream.com and the party's on

1074
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,860
Marriage and the chat

1075
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:27,860
This is a summer girl to be in the band of children

1076
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,860
Be true to yourself on the Charlie episode

1077
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,860
A 32 the snuff from Saturday edition

1078
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,860
And still plenty of tracks to go

1079
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,860
Funky fucking Miller

1080
01:06:40,860 --> 01:07:10,860
It's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my life, it's my

1081
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:37,400
great life, it's my life, I must find it, it's my life, it's my life, it's everything I hear, it's my life, a life, a perfume, everything I hold on, thee, behold.

1082
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,960
ilation

1083
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,920
had faced

1084
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,400
where to be

1085
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,080
and the real name

1086
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,880
Dr. Dicks

1087
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,160
here

1088
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,860
In this

1089
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:51,960
we're beyond

1090
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,400
three

1091
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,180
You go to a quest

1092
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,900
dangerous

1093
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,240
To the winds

1094
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,840
HIM

1095
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,240
Baroque

1096
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,640
Dokes

1097
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,640
Demons

1098
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,640
Music

1099
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:15,640
I set free, set you up, set that down, teach me how to leave my room

1100
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,640
I think that you're gonna lose you

1101
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:26,640
All the night in all the mixed web without looking back

1102
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,640
All the night in all the mixed web without looking back

1103
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,640
I think that you're gonna lose you

1104
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,640
No matter how good you are to be

1105
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,580
Remember to throw the train...

1106
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,620
Know he you're dead, or...

1107
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,560
Let's not start thinking

1108
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,020
You're gonna feel better

1109
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:13,560
Burn, burn, burn to wake

1110
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:43,560
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

1111
01:09:43,560 --> 01:10:13,560
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

1112
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:24,340
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

1113
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,340
Charlie, a three, two.

1114
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,740
Woo, nice to fade out, ladies.

1115
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:32,100
Hey, Space Shuttle, Atlantis launched yesterday.

1116
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,900
And I was just watching some, what is it, NASA channel.

1117
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,180
Now, it's the thing of myself, is that crazy

1118
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,380
that we walked on the moon in the 60s.

1119
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:45,060
I mean, I'm talking 40 years ago, more than 40 years ago.

1120
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,060
And the Space Shuttle, of course, was that 70s, late 70s, maybe.

1121
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,780
This is technology from 30, 30 plus years ago.

1122
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,020
And we haven't been able to do anything else.

1123
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,340
And I just look at how personal computers, integrated circuits,

1124
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,340
chips, how everything is advanced, the power of technology

1125
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,180
that we now hold in our hands.

1126
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,420
He got to think to yourself, isn't there more

1127
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,580
that they've got, maybe they're holding back on us?

1128
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:17,420
What did they just release the secret manual of the black bird?

1129
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:22,420
The X was at X 57, whatever, that stealth aircraft

1130
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,660
that flies at triple supersonic speeds.

1131
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,940
I mean, that thing's also from the 50s.

1132
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,340
You can't tell me that we haven't discovered something.

1133
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,660
Did technology just stop there in travel?

1134
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:35,860
Hmm.

1135
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,460
These are the things I think about.

1136
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,620
But after the gray goose, I really don't

1137
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,340
lay awake thinking about it.

1138
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,380
All we want is that it's ready.

1139
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,380
Today, my fellow Czechoslovans.

1140
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,300
All we've got is that we are part of a second Sunday

1141
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,500
for Raymond Hachdord.

1142
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,660
Africa Airlines Flight 8771 took off from Johannesburg Airport

1143
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:57,940
on Tuesday night.

1144
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:01,700
The Airbus A330 had 104 souls on board.

1145
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,660
Around 6am local time, as the plane approached the triple

1146
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,540
international airport in Libya, disaster struck.

1147
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:22,020
I wasn't intended to make a dot episode every week, but it seems

1148
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:26,180
the incidents that affect the nettle ends is increasing.

1149
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,860
Maybe you can imagine I'm a little band-out.

1150
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:32,140
Today's after the accident in Libya, it's still not clear what caused

1151
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,380
the crash of the airplane in the north of Africa.

1152
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:39,820
Local authorities said that no direct attack was called, and a technical fault

1153
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,420
unlikely.

1154
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,820
Despite of the hasty statement of the Libyan authorities immediately after

1155
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:49,420
the disaster, that it certainly was not an act of terror, experts are not so

1156
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,820
certain about that.

1157
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:55,740
Apparently the jet crashed about 400 meters from the nearest public road to

1158
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:59,740
the crash night that was some distance, and it was inside the secure perimeter

1159
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:03,020
of the airport, which explains why there were no ground injuries.

1160
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:08,140
According to aviation experts, can and shoot a terrorist attack on the Airbus

1161
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,140
certainly not be excluded.

1162
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,780
By the way, there also was no sign of volcanic ash in the air.

1163
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:20,700
A nine-year-old boy who is a Dutch citizen is the sole survivor of the deadly plane crash.

1164
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:27,260
The child identified as Rubin from Asso suffered multiple fractures in his lower limbs,

1165
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:31,780
and on the wind and operation at the Elkadra Hospital in Tripoli.

1166
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:38,100
The miracle boy is central to the worldwide coverage of this disaster that killed 92 passengers,

1167
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,100
and 11 crew members.

1168
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:46,100
Many foreign media reported extensively about the miracle that the boy managed to survive the crash.

1169
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,100
The Airbus jet carrying 104 people is crashed.

1170
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:58,100
It was trying to land a Tripoli international airport as pretty close to the city.

1171
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:02,100
Experts say that they are not allowed to enter the world.

1172
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:06,100
There are a lot of people who are not allowed to enter the world.

1173
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:09,100
Though an 1-year-old passenger, a nine-year-old young,

1174
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,100
he believed to be a fan.

1175
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,100
According to the Dutch government, he was heard to cry Holland, Holland, several times.

1176
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:21,100
Now, Dutch authorities, from the embassy of Tripoli, have seen the child,

1177
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:26,100
and the hospital in Tripoli has confirmed to CNN that he isn't in 80-year-old Dutch citizen.

1178
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,100
His name is Rubin Ben Assoom.

1179
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:34,100
The delegation which includes politicians and the Air Actives investigators has flown to Tripoli.

1180
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:39,100
Here in Tilburg, in the south of the Netherlands, this street is building behind me.

1181
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,100
This was the home of Rubin Ben Assoom.

1182
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:48,100
Rubin's aunt and uncle have arrived in Tripoli and have been to see him in hospital.

1183
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:53,100
When he does eventually go home to Holland, it will be without the people who were closest to him.

1184
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:58,100
His survival may be a miracle, but it is one overshadowed by grief.

1185
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:11,100
The death toll around his accident is 103, including 70 people from the Netherlands.

1186
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:17,100
A total Dutch family of five people cut and wore to ferry last minute before the plane took off.

1187
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,100
It's just one of the sad stories.

1188
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,100
So you probably can imagine this bonding thing in the Netherlands is not over yet.

1189
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:29,100
Many Dutch cities are plunged into moring.

1190
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,100
His nine-year-old Rubin lost his parents and brother on a plane crash.

1191
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:40,100
He's such a young boy with already such a heavy load on his shoulders.

1192
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:48,100
So that's helpful now, my fellow chocolates, take care and enjoy the weekends in the morning to you.

1193
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:52,100
Yeah, Raymond, well, thanks for blowing me out.

1194
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,100
Yeah, that whole story is pretty weird.

1195
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,100
I'm not quite sure what's going on with it.

1196
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:02,100
No one's talking about the cause of the crash, which apparently the aircraft was relatively new.

1197
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:10,100
It was an airbus now, of course we know that there's a war going on between Boeing and airbus, but still it happened in Tripoli,

1198
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:14,100
which is another interesting data point to think about.

1199
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:20,100
The skies were clear, apparently there was no weather, but no one's talking about the cause of the crash.

1200
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:29,100
It's all about the miracle boy, which I find strange, but I haven't really been able to find anything to,

1201
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,100
you know, anything at all really.

1202
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,100
There's a couple of things coming in on email, just want to check.

1203
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,100
What is this?

1204
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:45,100
The commencement of the University of North Dakota, where, who are Secretary of Homeland Security

1205
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,100
will be speaking there?

1206
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,100
I don't, okay.

1207
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,100
Watch the live video.

1208
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,100
Janet de Palatano and North Dakota, what's she doing there?

1209
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,100
All right, so that's not working.

1210
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,100
What else do I have here on email?

1211
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:05,100
Gotta, oh, adult Madonna, the band erotic aversion.

1212
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,100
Apparently worth playing on the daily source code.

1213
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Well, let's just have a listen for a second here.

1214
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:16,100
Hold on, this is coming in from the web, so it could suck.

1215
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,100
I'll be watching the video, and you guys listen.

1216
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,100
Ooh, all right, nice.

1217
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,100
Oh, this is pretty hot.

1218
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,100
I'll have to put this link into the show notes.

1219
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:38,100
No, let's be honest.

1220
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,100
Yeah.

1221
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:57,100
Of course, why would it work?

1222
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,100
All right, interesting experiment.

1223
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,100
Let's get rid of that then.

1224
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,100
Let's just end that.

1225
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,100
Ah, this was by request.

1226
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,100
Courtsmith, by the way, is on Twitter.

1227
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,100
Okay, she hadn't seen him yet.

1228
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,100
Oh, I'll do my best.

1229
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,100
He is the headline.

1230
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,100
Says you're pretty to choose.

1231
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,100
The second piece of my new shoes.

1232
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,100
I want to think that I'm trying to do.

1233
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,100
Say it.

1234
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:40,100
Someone in the Senate leaves off the wall.

1235
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,100
Who is the first one?

1236
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,100
Someone in the streets.

1237
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,100
Someone in the streets.

1238
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,100
Someone in the streets.

1239
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,100
Someone in the streets.

1240
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:57,100
Someone in the streets, someone in the streets.

1241
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,100
Something man in the nations.

1242
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,100
Someone in the streets.

1243
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,100
Somebody in the streets.

1244
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,100
Someone in the streets.

1245
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,100
Someone in the streets.

1246
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,100
Something man in the streets.

1247
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,100
Someone in the streets.

1248
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,100
People in line.

1249
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:14,100
Nobody Erfolg.

1250
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,100
I listen.

1251
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,580
I know, but according to my students,

1252
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,580
I know, but according to my students,

1253
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:27,180
The sins of love, the sins of love

1254
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:35,580
The signs, the sins of love, the sins of love

1255
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:41,180
The signs, the sins, the blood of peace

1256
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:46,180
The sins, the sins of love

1257
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:19,180
The sins, the sins of love

1258
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:27,180
The signs, the sins of love

1259
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:31,180
The signs, the sins of love

1260
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:37,180
The signs, the sins of love

1261
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:40,180
We'll take the money

1262
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,180
Everymore

1263
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,180
We'll pay the money

1264
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,180
Everymore

1265
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:51,180
We'll save the money

1266
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:56,180
We'll pay the money

1267
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:59,180
Everymore

1268
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,180
We'll pay the money

1269
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:03,180
We'll pay the money

1270
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:04,180
We'll pay the money

1271
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,180
Everymore

1272
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,180
We'll pay the money

1273
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,180
We'll pay the money

1274
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,180
We'll pay the money

1275
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,180
Everymore

1276
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,180
We'll pay the money

1277
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:15,180
We'll pay the money

1278
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,180
Everymore

1279
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:20,180
We'll pay the money

1280
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,180
We'll pay the money

1281
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:24,180
We'll pay the money

1282
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:24,500
We'll pay the money

1283
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:30,180
We'll pay the money

1284
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:41,180
The sea is the sun, the sea is the moon

1285
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:47,180
The sun is the sea is the moon

1286
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:55,180
The sea is the sun

1287
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:04,380
The sea is the sun, the sea is the moon

1288
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:16,180
The sea is the sun, the sea is the moon

1289
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:23,780
To be a state where we should go to the news of the primary and the left-chain,

1290
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:28,580
the right-and-thousand-coust, and we'll give you the victory now,

1291
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:51,980
I love us so much, remember me, who love you, smile as, love us Thank you so much,

1292
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:56,980
We repeat the same thing to them

1293
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:01,980
We sing the love of the stars we saw

1294
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,980
And the seeds we love

1295
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,980
We sing the love of the stars we saw

1296
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,980
And to me

1297
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:15,980
The politics of me

1298
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:20,980
We sing the love of the stars

1299
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,980
We sing the love of the stars

1300
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:27,980
We sing the love of the stars

1301
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,980
We sing the love of the stars

1302
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:35,980
We sing the love of the stars

1303
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:39,980
We sing the love of the stars

1304
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:40,980
We sing the love of the stars

1305
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:41,980
They're out on tour apparently

1306
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:42,980
I didn't know that

1307
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,980
If they come through a Los Angeles

1308
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,980
I will definitely go check them out

1309
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:46,980
Love those guys

1310
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,980
Cheers from fears

1311
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:50,980
With their beat-alask

1312
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,980
Sewing the seeds of love

1313
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,980
They said cursemith these days

1314
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,980
Big Twitter hound

1315
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,980
Scrolling through the chat room

1316
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:02,980
Mr. Oil has an interesting

1317
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,980
Well, the theory I would say

1318
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,980
But connection about the

1319
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,980
The Polish plane that crashed

1320
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,980
400 meters from the runway

1321
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,980
As did the AAA plane

1322
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,980
And yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing a passenger list

1323
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,980
I totally agree

1324
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,980
I think there's too much focus on the Dutch passengers

1325
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,980
Who else was on the aircraft

1326
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,980
Of course, really the question

1327
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,980
Yeah, quick update on the iPhone app

1328
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,980
I recompiled

1329
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:28,980
Got a little bit of help

1330
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,980
Thank you very much for the chucklehead to pitch in

1331
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,980
Made some changes

1332
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,980
Which I can undo remotely

1333
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:38,980
By the way, once the app is in

1334
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,980
But I need to get it past the Apple review team

1335
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,980
I put it in Sunday

1336
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,980
Almost a week ago

1337
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,980
And it's still waiting for review

1338
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,980
Which is a little disconcerting

1339
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:54,980
It's never taken this long for to get into the review process

1340
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,980
It's just waiting for review

1341
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,980
So it's like, you know, just twiddling my thumbs

1342
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:03,980
It's frustrating to say the least

1343
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,980
But I hope once it does hit review

1344
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,980
And maybe it'll happen on Monday

1345
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,980
I don't think they do any reviews over the weekend

1346
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,980
I hope that this coming week

1347
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:12,980
It'll finally be released

1348
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,980
Oh, wouldn't that be nice

1349
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,980
So an appropriate song to play

1350
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,980
Since I was denied

1351
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:19,980
Refused

1352
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,980
Might as well play refused

1353
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,980
Didn't even know these guys existed

1354
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,980
But I love this track

1355
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:27,980
It's called new noise

1356
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,980
And you can find it the iTunes store

1357
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,980
How twist it is that?

1358
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,980
Let's rock it on the Charlie

1359
01:26:41,980 --> 01:27:11,980
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Come to your base

Bring your eyes on the sky

1370
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,720
And you can increase your man

1371
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,720
Bring your tongue to the cover of the actual

1372
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,720
Look, look, look, look, look

1373
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,720

Rolls down!

1379

Hey!

And put the camp in the car.

01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,720
I can feel the spirit better and more to listen.

1385
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,720
Just because it's a single voice.

1386
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,720
You're the noise.

1387
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,720
You're on to the camp, you're on.

We've got loads of lessons.

We've got loads of lessons.

01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:07,720
We've got……

1397
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:39,720

1406
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:45,420
This is actually another cowbell, but I'll let you imagine the sound of that.

1407
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:48,420
Fins losing.

1408
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,420
Boys, I've been back in town.

1409
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:53,420
Guess who just got back today?

1410
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:56,420
They're why I'm not boys that have been away.

1411
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:59,420
Haven't changed yet much to say.

1412
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:02,420
But man, I still think I'm catch a great.

1413
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,420
They were asking if you were around.

1414
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,420
How you was where you could be found.

1415
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:11,420
Told them you were living down town.

1416
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:14,420
Traveling all the old men crazy.

1417
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,420
I was like a town.

1418
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:19,420
I was like a town.

1419
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:23,420
I was like a town.

1420
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:26,420
I was like a town.

1421
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,420
I was like a town.

1422
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,420
I was like a town.

1423
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,420
I was like a town.

1424
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,420
You know that chick that used to dance a lot?

1425
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:50,420
Every night you'd be all the floor shaking like you'd got.

1426
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:53,420
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot.

1427
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:56,420
I mean she was steaming.

1428
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,420
And that time over at Johnny's place.

1429
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:02,420
Well, this chick got up and she slept Johnny's face.

1430
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,420
There we just fell about the place.

1431
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:07,420
If that chick don't wanna know together.

1432
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,420
The boys are back in town.

1433
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,420
Boys are back in town.

1434
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,420
I see.

1435
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,420
Boys are back in town.

1436
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,420
Boys are back in town.

1437
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,420
Boys are back in town.

1438
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,420
Boys are back in town.

1439
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:25,420
Boys are back in town.

1440
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:55,420

Try the night they'll be dressed to kill

1442
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:07,420
Down that dinner as far as we're out

1443
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,420
The drink won't blow as blood will smell

1444
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,420
And if the fire's one of fate you better let on

1445
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,420
That you rocked in the gun, I've left it out my face

1446
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:19,420
It's all for night to get longer, it won't be long

1447
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,420
Won't be long, too, so my gun

1448
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,420
Now that the fire's here again

1449
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,420
The burning town won't blow as blood will smell

1450
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,420
Oh, it's a bacon town

1451
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,420
The burns are burned and the town

1452
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:42,420
The burns are burned and the town won't blow as blood will smell

1453
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:46,420
The burns are burnt and the town won't blow as blood will smell

1454
01:34:54,420 --> 01:35:24,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1455
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:37,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1456
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,120
Oh yes, the boys are back in town, and I'm about to skip out of town.

1457
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:46,540
At least I'll off the stream for a while and I'll blow the show of course.

1458
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,960
You know the way the setup is now.

1459
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,400
It's so easy to put your flip the switch, turn everything on.

1460
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:55,760
I don't have to, you know, reboot the machine and set up all the virtual routing anymore.

1461
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,760
I can pretty much go on the stream anytime I want.

1462
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,760
And I just made wind up doing that.

1463
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,960
I love it, and particularly with the feedback loop that we've got with the chat room at

1464
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:09,320
noagendachat.com, it really makes a lot of fun.

1465
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:13,200
So who knows, maybe I'll do another late night show.

1466
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,200
As I started on the show off today, I said that I was spinning the tunes late at night

1467
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,880
while completely hammered.

1468
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,840
And I'm paying for it this morning.

1469
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,840
Busy week coming up.

1470
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,560
First of all, we have episode 200 tomorrow in the morning of the Noagenda show.

1471
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,680
That'll be on the stream around 9 o'clock, get one nation west time.

1472
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:39,760
And somewhere John and I are going to produce somehow the 200.5 show, which will be for

1473
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,760
donors only.

1474
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,440
I'm not quite sure when we're going to do it.

1475
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:46,160
I'm scheduled to fly to San Francisco Monday and not coming back until Wednesday

1476
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,480
night.

1477
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:51,320
So I'll have to see how we do that or where we do it or when we do it.

1478
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,800
Now of course tomorrow will be the first time where hopefully John will be of reasonable

1479
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,000
quality as I now have a separate computer set up for Skype and I've got everything running

1480
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,400
through the old school analog mixing board.

1481
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,280
And it's going to be busy.

1482
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,880
I got a board meeting on Tuesday, holy crap.

1483
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,280
Anyway, what I did not hear anyone complain about is the sound.

1484
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,640
So I guess the sound is good.

1485
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:23,200
I guess everyone likes the way it sounds.

1486
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,400
I'm sure I'll be receiving some feedback after the recording.

1487
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:31,240
The podcast has released, which will be probably within the next hour.

1488
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,640
Let me know if you think there's anything we should adjust.

1489
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,760
And well, play one more song for you.

1490
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:43,680
This is actually the kind of song where you want to get close into the microphone.

1491
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,760
Breathe heavily.

1492
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:51,720
This is Michael Franks, who has done some amazing songs.

1493
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:53,720
This is one of my favorites.

1494
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,800
It's when it's like alls.

1495
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:02,920
When it's like a cause, the Prophet speaks with slight cause.

1496
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:07,320
The secret leaks, the sky falls.

1497
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,560
The day has stopped.

1498
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,760
The war is won.

1499
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,760
The battle is lost.

1500
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:18,000
When slight cause, it's 13 takes.
