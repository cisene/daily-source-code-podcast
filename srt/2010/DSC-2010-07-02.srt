00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're not in a city.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're currently alive.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know a genus 3.0.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's a fellow curry.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Born down in a dead man's name.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The first king that took us by a half hour man.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the blackened dog,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We beat you a bunch of days man.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Born to the US man.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Born to the US man.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Come back home to the river

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You have a man sick

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Stop it, you have a man sick

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000

Stop it, you have a man sick

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can't remember, I can't stop

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not with it, so let's do it

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's out now

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He and I want him look inside now

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I got a picture of a man

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't shout all the time

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Touch me up, I guess I'll do it

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm breathing, I'm saying here

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm fighting down the road

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, I don't realize I'm not a go

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000

How you doing everybody?

Come and eat from the new top one tower across the man's center.

We're celebrating the 4th of July.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're going around the globe. Come on, slaves.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Put free from those chains.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're my pride.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hangin' out of my bed.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You miss me with my life.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You show up on my bed.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Even if you're my children.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And you're screaming at my wife.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Get off of my bed.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you want to get out of here alive.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Freedom.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's what I want now.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Freedom.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's what I need now.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Freedom.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Freedom.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Freedom.

So I can do.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You got my heart.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Speak the letter and water.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You've got my soul.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Spivin' and heart.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know you're hooked on my girlfriend.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know the drugs don't matter.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What I don't need a dime.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm just trying to stand by my hand.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Freedom.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Freedom.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So I can do.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Freedom.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I can do.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Freedom.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Freedom.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's what I mean.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't have to.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's what I mean.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you don't mean it.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You better believe it.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you need this.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What could you just want to believe it?

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Because they can't go down somewhere else.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So I can do.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Freedom.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Freedom.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Freedom.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Freedom.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Freedom.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I can do.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Freedom.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I can do.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Freedom.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Freedom.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I can do.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Freedom.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So they need source code.

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They are to break your back to your web.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thanks for the sex spray.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's put a lot more.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you for living in the internet.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Freedom.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And for more fighting.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And this is the source code.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Delta Sheriff Charlie.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We are going to bring it home.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And you take it through the weekend.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You see the fence.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Stop working.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
How about a glass of water?

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
More like a rock.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Paranormal.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is my home.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I got a sheet of Jordan out of me.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
With my mind.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is the only thing I can be safe.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Because I am running all the time.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, they are not going to be your place.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But nothing seems to stop.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have never done this before.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, man, maybe, somebody else finds something to fight.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, man.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Can you ever reach my dream?

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or do you want my brains?

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh yeah.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000


159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I need someone to show me the meaning of that I can find

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I gotta see the things I've to make sure when I'm in the inside

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I need someone to show me the meaning of that I can find

In the middle of the races

172
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,180
It does the pocket Noah Jen to have.

173
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,380
Now with push notifications where we go live,

174
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,740

But maybe it's something to just slap on the iPod on the boom box for you

247
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,140

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,560
The car running through the stairs

Yeah, if you haven't seen it already, definitely check out the band as a YouTube video

315
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,620
The drama goes absolutely nuts, I'm just so

And all these bad awesome, but it certainly looked good in the clip

Essentially, I'm sitting outside everything is blowing nicely

Nobody

334
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
It's a mission

335
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
They can get you rocking

336
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
Don't eat or down

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Don't eat or down

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Don't eat or down

347
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Don't eat or down

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Don't eat or down

352
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Ah

353
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,500
I don't think you let it off, don't let it to it

354
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,460
You're home to fight, you're back

355
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,860
You're finally waiting

356
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,260
I can't fit in, I can't get it

357
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,500
You're back, I'm down, you're down

358
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,020
You're down, you're down

359
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,020
You're down, you're down

360
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,500
You're down

361
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:25,460

I know what done to this, what done to me, all about you, all about you

364
00:23:41,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I always wonder what that song was about.

365
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
I don't think it could be about for an occasion or anything.

366
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Still covered from close to close to hard-loss games everywhere,

367
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
down, down, deeper and down on Europe.

368

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
What a congratulate the Dutch team on their...

371
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Complete victory over Brazil and the World Concorded Finals.

372
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
They're on to the semi-finals.

373
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,320
This is where the max victory really starts to get into play.

374
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Let's play a Dutch man for these guys.

375
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
These old sus.

376
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
They don't celebrate.

377
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,320
There's on down the highway, top down, there's no round.

378
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
And your mustache can burn them all.

379
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
When pulling in your hair,

380
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
tall blonde in your side,

381
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
it can ruin your left hand.

382
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Let's take the car and save the fair.

383
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,320
We blew it, gas get on the great fine.

384
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,320
And even hours won't be paid.

385
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
We're not buying.

386
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
We're so so so so so.

387
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

388
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Summer night, it's not the leader.

389
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Can't stand the heat and other miles.

390
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Let's top the corner in the meet-up.

391
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,320
And at the cyborg for a while,

392
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I have a burger and a rookie.

393
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
You see the heaps on the other way.

394
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,320
A shot of breathing to blue deer.

395
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,320
We'll get across the golden gate.

396
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320

397
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320

410
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320

We'll get across the golden gate.

421
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Let's do all our checks

422
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
We're not bad

423
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,320
We don't even know where we're in the room in the tent

424
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
We've got a mirror

425
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Watch out on the bed

426
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Can you pull the floor with me

427
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320

I've got a spare

451
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:14,240
Bowrrrrrrrrr

452
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:28,740
You know there is an actual reason to a actual reason to want the Netherlands to win the

453
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:35,760
world cup official cornstarch of the daily source code Bobby Eden and that's Bobby

454
00:29:35,760 --> 00:30:05,760
with an eye as a promise to blow jobs all around so uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

455
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720


456
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,560
It doesn't matter what I feel through

457
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,760
I still be taking on James back

458
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,760
And you know the more things change

459
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
The more it's the the same

460
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
It may be a different day

461
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
But I'm on the same day

462
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Because one thing that allows

463
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
I still be taking on James back

464
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I got an attitude of trust in us

465
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I did some psychotherapy

466
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
I held myself to see self-help

467
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,760
I jabbered into the ASP

468
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,760
You know my wanders ever changing

469
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
And I move them down on the time

470
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,760
It doesn't matter what I feel through

471
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,760
I still be taking on James back

472
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
The more things change

473
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
The more it's the the same

474
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
It may be a different day

475
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
But I'm on the same day

476
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Because one thing that allows

477
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760

You got your drop machine

480
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,760
You got your arm really changed

481
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
You got your grungy sand

482
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
You got your state of the arts

483
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
You got your digital sound

484
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
It doesn't matter where it's going to

485
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I say what

486
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,760
I say what

487
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Take it to the brain

488
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Little get your way and live

489
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,760
When there's water all around

490
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
You can still get out of time

491
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,760
And still be taking on James back

492
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:06,760
You know the more things change

493
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
The more it's the the same

494
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,760
It may be a different day

495
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
But I'm on the same day

496
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,760

You know

514
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Can't help myself

515
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Yeah

516
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
One thing that allows

517
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,760
I still be taking on James back

518
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Show me one radio station

519
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
And what is that song?

520
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Let's show you a bridge I want to show you

521
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Ta-da-da

522
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Ta-da-da

523
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Just one thing that allows

524
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
One point to say now

525
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Let's still be taking on James back

526
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
You got it people

527
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Let me think of my good body

528
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
The radio

529
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Off with my guard

530
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Whoa

531
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Why don't we just keep the phone going

532
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Next up to everybody in the house tonight

533
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
To say the least

534
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Yeah

535
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Oh well

536
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
It's items

537
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
What can I say?

538
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Sometimes it cuts off in a weird moment

539
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
My request was not what I was walking down a shore

540
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Oh

541
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
It wasn't like this

542
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
For a million years ago

543
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I lived a single bit

544
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Pick up a monkey scout ago

545
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
I spent my spend time

546
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Just got with blue eyes

547
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
I felt a little tight

548
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
So I watched my hand

549
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760

In my heart

724
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Todd Runren, I saw the light on the Charlie 837

725
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,520
As the episode number, it is a Freedom Food Bar edition

726
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,520
A Freedom Food Bar edition

727
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,520
Wait, I know what I can fix that

728
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,520
Yeah, Drinking Corona

729
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,520
And blood's seeping out of my ear

730
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,520
I got the headphones cranked up so loud today, it's great

731
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,520
So our one almost done

732
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,520
We've got at least another hour to go

733
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,520
And I'm feeling really, really good

734
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,520
Hopefully a lot of you get this on the podcast

735
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
We'll be playing it on your 4th of July celebration

736
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
So happy 4th of July everybody

737
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
We celebrate independence

738
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,520
Of course a lot of chain about has changed

739
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Since the Declaration of Independence was signed

740
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,520
And since we declared independence

741
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,520
From Great Britain

742
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,520
And still a lot of work to be done

743
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,520
Because I feel like a lot of our independence

744
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,520
This has been taken away from the inside

745
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,520
And I will say it one more time

746
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,520
This is the best country to live in in the world

747
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,520
For one reason, one reason only

748
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,520
Second Amendment right

749
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,520
We have the right to bear arms

750
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,520
And that is the right to protect the country

751
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
From forces and evil from outside and within

752
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,520
And that's why we still are free men and women

753
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,520
To a certain extent because they know

754
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,520
If we really get pissed off

755
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,520
We all got some hardware we'd like to show you

756
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
All we want each night is ready

757
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
Hey everybody, it's been a long time

758
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,520
Hope we've got to be a part of us against the day

759
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
What's happening

760
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
I haven't spent a ballet

761
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,520
What's up with that?

762
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,520
Oil, drugs and sucker

763
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,520
That's basically it

764
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,520
Not a lot of sucker on the DSC during this World Cup edition

765
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
In South Africa

766
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
As you all know, after my vacation

767
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,520
My computer blew up and I had to buy a new one

768
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,520
So my offline status lasted for almost four weeks

769
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,520
And I must say I kind of enjoyed it

770
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,520
I gave me a lot of time to do other things

771
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,520
Watch the World Cup soccer for example

772
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:45,520
Yeah everybody, it's World Cup fever over here

773
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,520
It's just like the super duper duper ball

774
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,520
Only different

775
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,520
The Dutch are kicking ass, but I kind of be careful

776
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,520
This Friday the orange nights from the Netherlands

777
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,520
Will be play against the big Brazilian godly canaries

778
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,520
By the time the Fuba Friday is giving us all the vitamins to get through this weekend

779
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,520
The results of the World Cup match will be effect

780
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
I can make an actual update about the match

781
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,520
But I could give you some World Cup facts

782
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,520
For example

783
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,520
Do you know that the World's first international soccer match was a challenge match

784
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,520
Playing class cow

785
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,520
In 1872 between Scotland and England

786
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,520
World Cup matches to place simultaneously on July the 13th

787
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,520
1930 and we're wrong by friends and US

788
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,520
The first goal in World Cup history was scored by E.J. Loren

789
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,520
Of France

790
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:45,520
The World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is the world's most widely viewed sporting event

791
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:51,520
An estimated 715.1 million people watched the final match

792
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,520
Of the 2006 World Cup held in Germany

793
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,520
The trophy is 14.2 in his eye

794
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,520
Made of solid 18 karat gold

795
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
That 75%

796
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
And weights about 6.1 kilogram

797
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Two players shared a record for playing the most World Cup

798
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
Mexico's Antonio Caballio

799
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,520
And Germany's Lothar Mateos

800
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,520
But played in 5 tournaments

801
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,520
The overall top goal score in World Cup is

802
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,520
Brazilians Ronaldo scored a 15 goals in 3 tournaments

803
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,520
The World Cup soccer is all about money

804
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,520
The damn right Adam

805
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,520
The total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA S

806
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,520
420 million dollars

807
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,520
Just a fraction of the life money

808
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,520
Will be 30 million dollars for the best soccer team in the world

809
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,520
Yeah, you're damn right

810
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
It's all about the money

811
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,520
So from now on there will be four important matters

812
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,520
Gold, oil, drugs

813
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,520
And soccer

814
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,520
That's got

815
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,520
Well, it's good to enjoy some happy orange grays

816
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,520
Just cream like an idiot to your TV screen

817
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,520
And watch soccer with your friends

818
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,520
And honeys the government

819
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,520
Life is wonderful

820
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,520
So everybody in the no agenda chat

821
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,520
Who's going to win the World Cup 2010?

822
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,520
Who cares?

823
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,520
It's going to be a beautiful sunny summer weekend

824
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,520
And get more nation lowlands

825
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,520
And I would like to play a new song from a Dutch guy

826
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,520
It's a song about celebrating a freedom

827
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,520
This is Ellen Clark for freedom

828
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
On the Charlie

829
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,520
In the morning to you all

830
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,520
Thank you so much Ryan

831
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,520
I think they're going to keep the Netherlands going for quite a while

832
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,520
To hide the fact that they have no government

833
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
Oh nation

834
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,520
We got freedom

835
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,520
We got freedom

836
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,520
I'm going to raise this so that everybody understands

837
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,520
And all around the world

838
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,520
There's a need for rest to stand

839
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,520
And raise our hands free

840
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,520
For every living man

841
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,520
So get it out your pocket

842
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,520
Put it to the sky

843
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,520
Everyone together

844
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,520
Raise your head up high

845
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,520
We got freedom

846
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,520
We got freedom

847
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,520

Yeah, that's kind of a summer hit like the sound of that and that, right on the Charlie everybody, he's back from vacation and we're very, very happy to have him because he always knows

882
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,320
those had to cheer us up and call me off guard there.

883
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,320
I was just kind of slipping away thinking,

884
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,320
I don't have to do much.

885
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,320
I was suddenly like calling out to the cowbell.

886
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,320
Oh my god.

887
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,320
Should we take it back to the end of your more time?

888
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,320
I think so.

979
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:54,280
It's possible so there's some support for their system there and of course through shazam and soundhound

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1044
01:18:36,960 --> 01:19:06,960
oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Charles,

1045
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,400
was me touching myself.

1046
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,440
Yeah, in fact, I'm quite sure.

1047
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,640
Coo, boy, was she hot back in the day.

1048
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,440
She's still okay in kind of a gulfy sort of way.

1049
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,160
Hey chat room, say it with me now.

1050
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,720
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

1051
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,840
Hi, hi, hi.

1052
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,640
The clouds all wake.

1053
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,080
The straw for the donk is a mirror.

1054
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,360
It's gonna sleep safe, sleep safe.

1055
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,840
All sleep safe, sleep safe.

1056
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,920
All sleep safe, sleep safe.

1057
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,680
And all the world is football shaped.

1058
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:59,520
It's just from me to kick, space, and I can see it's now just safe.

1059
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:10,600
All I've got the one-two team of five, says it won't be old, but I'm trying to take this

1060
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,600
solid.

1061
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:21,440
I've got one-two team of five, says it won't be old, but I'm trying to take the

1062
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:28,440
level, and I be it, but you're at the truth, but I'll softly shine.

1063
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:39,040
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

1064
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:44,000
It's day, just through for the fingers and the ears that's gonna all live

1065
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:57,000
slowly, slowly, my mind, the sky will cry, you will start the Thursday and the

1066
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:10,960
guilty one's gonna all die slowly, all the die slowly, and all the world is biscuit shaped.

1067
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:20,080
It's just from me to me, my face, and I can see it's now just safe, and I've got one-two

1068
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:31,080
team of five, says it won't be old, but I'm trying to take this all in, and I've got one-two

1069
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:39,040
team of five, says it won't be old, but I'm trying to take this all in, but I'm trying to take

1070
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:46,040
this all in, and I be it, but you're at the truth, but I'll softly shine.

1071
01:21:46,040 --> 01:22:05,040
And it works my whole whole max guide and it's like you do black eye.

1072
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:20,040
But don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there.

1073
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:35,040
You're there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there.

1074
01:22:35,040 --> 01:23:05,040
And all the world is full of shame, it's just for me to take it, but I can see it's now just safe, and I've got one-two team of five, says it won't be old, but I'm trying to take this all in, and I've got one-two team of five, says it won't be old, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't

1075
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:35,040
be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don

1076
01:23:35,040 --> 01:24:05,040
be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, and don't be there, But don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, and don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't be there, it's because so did something to make you who you are, but don't be there, but don't be there, but don't, be there, but don't be there, but don't, not be there, but don't be there, but don't be

1077
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:15,040
chat.com. When we do the show live, like this one. Heart. Crazy on the earth.

1078
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:46,040
It may still have time, but still goodbye. Every time I think about it, I won't cry.

1079
01:24:46,040 --> 01:25:00,040
With bones in the devil, the kids keep coming. Don't win it with easy time to be your home.

1080
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:07,040
When I tell myself, they never do it all right. That's nothing left to do at night.

1081
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:21,040
But for free, they all knew. Crazy on you. Let me go crazy, crazy on you.

1082
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:29,040
I love you, you don't waste your skin. But generally, we've seen the waves in the wind.

1083
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:42,040
The whisper that calls for you in the night, and kisses you here and there in the night.

1084
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:57,040
And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine. I love the pleasure of mine, and I don't need to be your home.

1085
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:05,040
Let me go crazy, crazy on you.

1086
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:13,040
Why mentors crying in the pain? What's going to do with everybody insane?

1087
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:20,040
So I might have lost you so free to you, but you both do.

1088
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:45,040
We're going crazy on you. Let me go crazy, crazy on you.

1089
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:53,040
I was a will of last night in a dream. I've been down over when you're running stream.

1090
01:26:53,040 --> 01:27:00,040
Saying you're somewhere above, and you can't be alive when you're sweet.

1091
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:12,040
Like me, crazy on you. Let me go crazy on you.

1092
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:28,040
Like me, crazy on you. Let me go crazy, crazy on you.

1093
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:07,040
We are

1094
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,480
We are you

1095
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,840
We are you

1096
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,400
And we go crazy

1097
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,200
And Minhanz that we will

1098
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,700
And sisters

1099
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:34,380
I've got the crazy bad animal studio, I guess, is what they're doing these days.

1100
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:38,660
So I am desperately waiting for a shipment of old Holburn.

1101
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:43,780
I believe Mr. Oil was nice enough to send some off, so I'm completely out.

1102
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:49,100
I still have a couple of Rizla extra long slims, which is really the whole secret to rolling

1103
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,620
your own as the kind of paper that you use, the tobacco, of course, is pretty important

1104
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:54,620
as well.

1105
01:28:55,540 --> 01:29:00,380
A couple of, you know, what I do is when it gets down to kind of the nitty gritty, I'll save

1106
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:01,100
the packs.

1107
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,660
And so I'm literally smoking like the last little bit, see, let me lick this up here.

1108
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:12,140
Just the kind of hard here, because once you roll it up, then you've got a grab one

1109
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:15,180
in quick before it all leaks out because it's so grovely.

1110
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:18,220
It's just, it's like sand almost, but it's worth it.

1111
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,420
I'd rather smoke this than the formaldehyde Mr. Malbro puts in his smokes.

1112
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,540
So I got a block of freedom tracks coming up for it.

1113
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:28,380
This will be a little bit of a musical education.

1114
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,820
I want to talk about freedom just a bit.

1115
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:35,260
First of all, I heard the president of the United States of Gitmo Nation, President Obama yesterday,

1116
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:39,340
referenced the stature of liberty in his speech about immigration.

1117
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:43,100
And we may even bring this up on Sunday, which, of course, will be the fourth of July,

1118
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,460
and there will be an in the morning early service, no agenda.

1119
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,740
Of course, we never stop for any holiday, even our own.

1120
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,820
We actually can't schedule vacations on desert islands,

1121
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,100
unless there's some kind of satellite connection that will actually work.

1122
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:03,660
And he referenced the immigrants and the statue of liberty, and I have to take a little bit of

1123
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,540
issue with that, because, of course, Ellis Island is where immigrants would come in.

1124
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:11,500
And we're at immigration, we're an immigrant country, which is great.

1125
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:15,900
Immigrants are welcome if you come in legally, which is obviously the issue at hand.

1126
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:20,860
But the statue of liberty really had nothing to do with immigrants.

1127
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:25,260
It was a gift from the French on the one, this is, I don't know,

1128
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,500
did they not teach anybody anything in school anymore?

1129
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,100
Why does the president have to propagate this?

1130
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:32,780
It was given to us by the French on the 100th anniversary of our,

1131
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:34,780
is celebration of our independence.

1132
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:39,500
And of course, the French were really happy that we became independent from the, from the

1133
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:44,300
Brits, which is why they said, hey, morph hairs, here's a nice statue.

1134
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:46,620
And the statue of liberty, she is walking forward.

1135
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:52,940
And every Sunday, we certainly fight to continue Lady Liberty's walk forward.

1136
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,620
At least I do, I think John does as well.

1137
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,620
But freedom really, of course, is a state of mind.

1138
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:03,020
It should have been a God-given right, doesn't seem that way anymore in Gitmonation.

1139
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:10,460
And about two weeks ago, I made a couple of big decisions.

1140
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:13,180
It looted to it a little bit here on the Charlie.

1141
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:15,820
I think there was on a snafu Saturday edition of the show.

1142
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:19,740
And even though I have not yet completed all the steps necessary,

1143
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:23,500
because there's a couple of things that have to be taken care of before I can go all out.

1144
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:29,580
The change in my mind has immediately had an effect on the world around me and things that are happening.

1145
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:35,500
The minute I said, you know what, I want to be free from shackles, free from things that I don't

1146
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:40,460
want to do. I want to concentrate at what I do want to do immediately, things started to happen.

1147
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:45,100
It happened for me. And it's just a state of mind. It's a change and it's amazing.

1148
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,500
And I've almost forgotten. I'd almost forgotten how easy it is when you change something in your life.

1149
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,580
And it's a big one. And you decide to go for it.

1150
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:57,100
You know, they say often when one door closes, another door opens, boy does it ever.

1151
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:04,380
And not just for me, but for Miss Mickey as well. She just did a huge casting for a

1152
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:09,420
for a show, a television show. I'm not allowed to talk about it because it would jinx it.

1153
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:15,100
But if she gets this, and so I feel like she will. I don't know what it is.

1154
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:22,380
It fits so in line with obviously with her work, but also a little bit with mine, which is really

1155
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:29,580
the crazy thing about it. And I have really, I'm just just good vibes all around that that happens.

1156
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:35,100
And for myself, great stuff happening in the coming week, Thursday, if all things go according to

1157
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,140
plan, there will be a USA today article. And I don't want to jinx that, of course, but we're just

1158
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:44,700
amongst friends here, so I might as well tell you, which would be about the big app show,

1159
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:50,140
which I'm very excited about. That thing is just kicking ass. Over a hundred thousand people are using

1160
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:58,140
it daily, watching my picks for iPhone apps. And I'm working on the OS4 compatible version,

1161
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:05,500
so that I can take advantage of some of the new features in iOS4. Particularly I ads. And I think

1162
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:11,020
that if I think I just love to show free apps all the time, why even bother with a 5% link share

1163
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:17,020
bounty on getting someone to buy an app. There's so many good free apps. And I'm just going to ask

1164
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:22,540
people, hey, click on the ad, and you'll support this, and then you'll support the developers of

1165
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:29,580
their apps. It's a very interesting concept to Cupertino is put together. We're getting back to

1166
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:35,660
the freedom. That's really what is so fantastic is you just have to make that switch in your mind

1167
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:43,340
when you do things happen. I promise you, things happen, try it. So this fourth of July,

1168
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:50,780
if you're a citizen of the United States of Gitmo Nation, then think about that as you're eating

1169
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:57,420
your hot dog and going out to the sales, think about what freedom really does mean because it's not

1170
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:01,900
just freedom from oppressive governments. It's freedom from yourself, freedom from these shackles you put

1171
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:07,500
on yourself. And if you live anywhere else in Gitmo Nation, the same applies. That's a group

1172
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:13,260
thing about it. It works for everybody. So three songs titled freedom one after another. The first

1173
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:19,500
one is an absolute must this is something you have to have in your musical knowledge you must have

1174
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:24,940
had perred the unimitable Charles Mingus.

1175
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:51,900
This music for Moscow, this music for the South. What's music has something to do? Mostly

1176
01:34:51,900 --> 01:35:00,300
mouth mouth. This music could be called stubborn and lazy. But in the clever side of it, this music could

1177
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:08,860
be working, waiting and learning and planning. For a sake of kind of day, a day when running sticks

1178
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:15,580
and crosses, there's not mere Charles Ming, for the mad man, there's most incapacitated room.

1179
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:24,460
Who's loved this soul is imperfection and it's the most lustrous room. So stand fashion on

1180
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:31,820
you, so within contemplation, let running hold and he can thigh. Your stubbornness of a living

1181
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:35,820
and your long side is about to die.

1182
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:21,020
Freedom, fighting, standing, freedom, for your mama's mama. Freedom, for your brother's sister.

1183
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:30,220
But no freedom for me.

1184
01:36:51,020 --> 01:37:21,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1185
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:51,020
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1186
01:37:51,020 --> 01:38:21,020
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1187
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:51,020
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1188
01:38:51,020 --> 01:39:21,020
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no,

1189
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:26,020
Freedom for your brothers and sisters

1190
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:31,420
But no freedom for me

1191
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,820
That's right, Mr. Royal.

1192
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:34,620
The sacks should be touching your soul.

1193
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,820
That's what it's meant for.

1194
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:40,020
That's why Mingus is so absolutely phenomenal.

1195
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:43,620
Now, some more Americana, more freedom.

1196
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:47,020
Got to do some shit, kick your music.

1197
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,020
Otherwise, doesn't count.

1198
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:51,020
Can you just me?

1199
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:54,020
Yeah, I can hear your groaning, but you know what?

1200
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,020
The message is in the music, my friends, have a listen.

1201
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:15,020
People always tell me they're not story.

1202
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:18,020
Love they've lost, they're taste of glory.

1203
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:22,020
You said next to me at the counter in the diner set

1204
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:26,020
I used to be Wall Street, but this is much finer.

1205
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,020
Oh, yeah.

1206
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:36,020
You had a leather look going to steal horse Harley

1207
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:39,020
And a dark-eyed girl friend he coached

1208
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:43,020
And looked a little lost while getting out the door

1209
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:47,020
And I think I knew what he was looking for

1210
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:53,020
Freedom.

1211
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:58,020
Sweet freedom.

1212
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:06,020
I guess to run back in my cat to my wife

1213
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:09,020
I'm a husband to my kids I'm a dad

1214
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:13,020
To the credit card companies I'm just another sucker

1215
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:17,020
The IRS long haul trucker

1216
01:41:19,020 --> 01:41:21,020
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:34,020
So say that freedom is the power to do one please

1218
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:36,020
You can live like the devil

1219
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:38,020
But hold on to Jesus

1220
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:42,020
I found no one thing I was more than knew

1221
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:45,020
Girl, that's why I'm running bad to you

1222
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:50,020
Freedom.

1223
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:57,020
Sweet freedom.

1224
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:11,020
You come up in my truck with his green devil bag

1225
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:14,020
I knew he was a soldier cause a saw is no chance

1226
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,020
We talked about it

1227
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,020
We cried about it

1228
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:25,020
Then I steal horse Harley came ruin on past

1229
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:28,020
I knew it was charred hanging on real fast

1230
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,020
We talked about it

1231
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:34,020
We laugh about it

1232
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:41,020
Freedom, joy and pain, they live in brains

1233
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:50,020
Knowing I want the same thing

1234
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:59,020
Freedom.

1235
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:04,020
Sweet freedom.

1236
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:47,020
You come up in my truck with his green devil bag

1237
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:53,020
It's like a shocking news that the needle can give

1238
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:56,020
The oppressed and forgotten are praying for it

1239
01:43:56,020 --> 01:44:00,020
It's what the brave and courageous are fighting for

1240
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:04,020
And help yourself on a distant show

1241
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,020
Freedom.

1242
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:10,020
Oh, yeah.

1243
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,020
I'm just a country boy at heart, I guess

1244
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:14,020
Can he chest and he freedom on the daily source code

1245
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:17,020
You're freedom fried a food bar addition

1246
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:19,020
And there's one last thing I wanted to say about freedom

1247
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:22,020
You know, I'm so feel so free

1248
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:25,020
And it doesn't happen often here in Southern California

1249
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:28,020
The people's Republic here at the Hilltop Watch Tower

1250
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:30,020
Crackpot Command Center, but from time to time

1251
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:35,020
These blue skies are clouded and they're clouded by a criss-cross of

1252
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:38,020
What I'll just have to call chemtrails

1253
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:41,020
And I know a lot of people listen to the show

1254
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:45,020
Believe that someone is spraying something in the air

1255
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,020
And they're not just chemtrails

1256
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:51,020
I've kind of promised that I wouldn't just

1257
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:54,020
Bring up nefarious comments about it on no agenda

1258
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,020
Because unlike the earthquake machine

1259
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:59,020
Which I have a lot of documented proof that they do exist

1260
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:01,020
Or at least the government believes they exist

1261
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:04,020
I don't have that yet for chemtrails

1262
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,020
And it was taken a shower this morning

1263
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:09,020
When I realized that we're taking the wrong approach

1264
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:13,020
Now the reason why I know that this is both the idea that these

1265
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,020
Stripes in the air

1266
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:18,020
Which by the way San Francisco filled with them

1267
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,020
London filled with them

1268
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:23,020
They may be happening where you live as well

1269
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:25,020
The reason I don't believe these are contrails

1270
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:27,020
Can I know a little bit about flying

1271
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,020
And this is the approach all of a sudden that hit me

1272
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:32,020
I'm like, oh yeah, I got to talk to some chuckleheads

1273
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:35,020
Because the guy as I guys out there can probably help build some

1274
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:38,020
iPhone and Android apps to debunk

1275
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:40,020
At least we can prove that they're not contrails

1276
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,020
That would be the easiest. Now if you look at the science

1277
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,020
Yes, I said science

1278
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:49,020
Of contrails, these really can only scientifically appear

1279
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:52,020
At about 25 to 28,000 feet

1280
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:55,020
That's when the particles exuding from the jet engines

1281
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:59,020
Can actually crystallize form ice and become a contrail

1282
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,020
Now what's good to know about aviation

1283
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:05,020
Is that the way all aircraft fly

1284
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:08,020
Except those that have some kind of special authorization

1285
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,020
Is based upon routes

1286
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:13,020
And these routes are published in maps

1287
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,020
And these maps can be overlaid with a KML file

1288
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,020
On Google Earth

1289
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,020
Very easily

1290
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:22,020
In fact, there's a couple of them out there already

1291
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:26,020
And when you're flying, you basically fly along these routes

1292
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:30,020
And there's turning points, there's vectors, there's places where you fly to

1293
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,020
And then you turn and you fly to the next point

1294
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:33,020
And guess what?

1295
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:36,020
They're not laid out, Chris crossed the way these things

1296
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,020
Aren't a tic-tac-toe grid

1297
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:43,020
So what if we were able to create some apps that worked with iPhones

1298
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:46,020
And Android-based phones with a camera

1299
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:50,020
Where if you see one of these com-contrails

1300
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:53,020
You have to be right over you otherwise it probably won't work

1301
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:55,020
You need a GPS as well, you take a picture

1302
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:58,020
Look and straight up into the sky

1303
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,020
It documents your exact position so that we can overlay that

1304
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:05,020
With the actual published flight routes

1305
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:11,020
And even if these contrails that you're taking pictures of

1306
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:14,020
Would be at 28,000 feet plus

1307
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:19,020
They would have to pretty much match the published flight routes

1308
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:21,020
In the IFR charts

1309
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:24,020
And I guarantee you they do not

1310
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:28,020
And at least we could dispel the fact that these are contrails

1311
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:30,020
Because they don't match up

1312
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:33,020
And let me tell you, these things, these Chris-cross tic-tac-toe grids

1313
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,020
Are often so close to each other

1314
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:38,020
That we'd have airplanes having made our collisions all the time

1315
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:41,020
If they actually were flight routes

1316
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:44,020
And planes were following these flight routes

1317
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:47,020
It doesn't seem like a very hard app to make

1318
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:50,020
And I know there's a couple of great developers listening to this show

1319
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:53,020
If we could kind of bundle all of our resources together

1320
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:55,020
We could probably get this out there

1321
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:57,020
And a lot of people would be using this

1322
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,020
And within not too long amount of time

1323
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:01,020
We would have a pretty good overlay of these

1324
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:05,020
Contrails compared to published flight routes

1325
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:08,020
And at least that would be a start so we could say to the FAA

1326
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:12,020
Hey, you know, who's flying over creating Contrails

1327
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,020
Outside of the published routes

1328
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:16,020
Food for thought?

1329
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:17,020
I hope so

1330
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:19,020
Now let me take you to the 80s for another

1331
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:22,020
And our last in the set of three of Freedom Songs

1332
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,020
Come on

1333
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:40,020
Oh yeah

1334
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:46,020
If you want to party in that special body

1335
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,020
And you know that

1336
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:52,020
We don't care if you need to take it

1337
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,020
Or if you're a senior citizen

1338
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:56,020
Because we got a pizza just won't end

1339
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:58,020
So you better get ready to rise

1340
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:00,020
My friends you see we got some news

1341
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:02,020
And all of that you can't refuse

1342
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,020
Break you in a pot

1343
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,020
And you got to come

1344
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:06,020
Because you're the one

1345
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:09,020
Red little black wide of ground

1346
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:11,020
And our own way are we gonna get down

1347
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:12,020
Just take the time

1348
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:13,020
Enjoy yourself

1349
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,020
And you rock as good as anyone else

1350
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,020
Come on go to it

1351
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:17,020
Put your body in

1352
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:18,020
If the feeling is good

1353
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:20,020
And you might as well see it

1354
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,020
Make no say

1355
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,020
I just stand in the right

1356
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,020
Just pull it to the feet

1357
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:24,020
On the fuck is that

1358
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:25,020
You don't rock with us

1359
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:26,020
You won't have a ball

1360
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,020
And we might as well

1361
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:28,020
Didn't rock at all

1362
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,020
See we can't rock

1363
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:30,020
If you don't have fun

1364
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,020
Because you're the one

1365
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,020
That's no but what

1366
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:34,020
Now bring your hand up

1367
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,020
Okay

1368
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:36,020
If you fuck me

1369
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:37,020
What I said

1370
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:38,020
Hey my hands

1371
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:39,020
You're the one

1372
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:40,020
Don't fuck the same

1373
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:41,020
Oh yeah

1374
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:42,020
Oh yeah

1375
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,020
Woo

1376
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:45,020
Woo

1377
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:46,020
Woo

1378
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,020
Woo

1379
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,020
Woo

1380
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,020
Woo

1381
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:50,020

1382

1384
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:53,020
Woo

1385
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,020
Woo

1386
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:55,020
Woo

1387
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:57,020
Woo

1388
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:58,020
Woo

1389
01:49:59,020 --> 01:49:59,700
Minula

1390
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:00,500
With the planet

1391
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,140
I'm gonna ride

1392
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:01,700
You jam

1393
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:02,940
bringing your baby

1394
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:04,060
I'm so bad

1395
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:05,020
I feel like a rut

1396
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:05,440
or a rag

1397
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,200
Will you find a thing

1398
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:06,900
Where I'll turn

1399
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:07,580
So I stand on

1400
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:08,700
Misternets with that rut

1401
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,460
To bed Zoey

1402
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:10,020
And I'm ready to rock

1403
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:10,820

01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,300

1406
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:12,060

I'll ride

1411
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:15,580
I'm gonna do the rest

1412
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:16,740
Some of my flames are heating

1413
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:17,900
Most of the queen

1414
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,100
Untaking them all innocent

1415
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:19,920
Give it no house

1416
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,060
No ladies in the place

1417
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:21,980
wake me all

1418
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:22,340

1419
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:23,180
All of the life

1420
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:24,260
You've been never going wrong

1421
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:25,420
They are chasing my name

1422
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:26,140
What's that day

1423
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:26,600
They did

1424
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,600
The secret forbidden from act the way

1425
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,600
I'm slim, I'm cool, I'm solid, yo, fake call me

1426
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,600
The fucking trio of the C-O-D-V-O-W

1427
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,600
I'm the man, so bad, bad, you can't deny it

1428
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,600
And when you ask it, I'm boy, just play me, I'm down boys

1429
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,600
I never ran away, I grab myself, I could faster

1430
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:46,600
But then it ain't no, so to the whole full

1431
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,600
Girl, he's a one of a kind, their flashes

Keep you in the crew, hold it

01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,700
Then right to the feet in the godlight

1486
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:17,900
And then you can't beat

1487
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:18,900
And with a baseball

1488
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,300
I'm the play dumb game

1489
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,300
And I won't feel ashamed because I got more squad

1490
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:23,300
Then in this thing

1491
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:24,300
And I'm not the putty in the face

1492
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:25,300
Go old to can't stick

1493
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:26,700
Make the butt I miss the net

1494
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:27,700
The woman's taking you

1495
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,900
When I touch the subgirl

1496
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:30,100
The girls think I'm dumb

1497
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:30,900
But that's okay

1498
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,100
Because they all get some

1499
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,100
I'm a tellin' like it

1500
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:34,100
To a never-discuss

1501
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:34,900
But that net

1502
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,500
And in the love club

1503
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:37,500
I'm the more the keep you all

1504
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,500
When you tend to straighten

1505
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,500
I'm the just of the job

1506
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,500
So keep what I say

1507
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:41,100
This is what I say

1508
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:41,300
This is what I say

1509
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:42,300
Give the use for you

1510
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:43,700
To keep all the want you to do

1511
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:44,900
It's just so I don't read

1512
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,300
I'm a hundred percent on

1513
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:47,100
All the time

1514
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:48,100
I'm like Earl the Pearl

1515
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:49,300
When I'm saying the rock

1516
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:50,300
I can get tick on

1517
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,300
Like a magical wand

1518
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:52,300
I'm an old British

1519
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:53,700
And my world is falling

1520
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:54,900
This is real bad

1521
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:55,900
The power flow

1522
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,100
But if you whip up

1523
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:58,100
I'm a full moon

1524
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,500
The music has so great

1525
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,700
The best thing down

1526
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:02,100
Do the fuck it's out

1527
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,300
Now clap your hands

1528
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,500
Do the free dance

1529
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,300
Because I'm a bitch

1530
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:06,500
And my son your son

1531
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,700
Because if I rock

1532
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:09,700
We're fat in the rocket down

1533
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:11,900
The water's the bread

1534
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,100
The bread to the water

1535
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:23,020
Come onion, it'd be RAP

1536
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:24,020
What's that just you said?

1537
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:24,900
Stop!

1538
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:25,900
Go!

1539
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:26,100
With the egg

1540
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:26,700
Caught your milk

1541
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:27,340
Caught your�

1542
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:28,900
After the party

1543
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:29,700
Come on

1544
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,500
You're the one

1545
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:31,220
You're the one

1546
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:32,300
Like you, you're the one

1547
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,500
We're talking stop

1548
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,500
We're talking stop

1549
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,500
People, you'll stop

1550
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:36,740
And then kannst fuck

1551
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:37,300
Do it wrong

1552
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:37,900
Say, hey

1553
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:38,300
Just be honest

1554
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:38,820
Go

1555
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,900
When you rock

1556
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:40,860
That we're all

1557
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:42,700
If there's some

1558
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,540
It's you, Bob.

1559
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:15,340
Okay, let's look on your arm and check.

1560
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,180
Oh, I like it.

1561
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:17,180
Graham has to mash.

1562
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:18,180
Mellie Mellie.

1563
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,700
I think the theory is five in there as well.

1564
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:24,260
And the freedom wrapping up our triple set there.

1565
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:27,780
Let's get back to some of the other hookier stuff.

1566
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,820
Mr. Biggs, Romeo.

1567
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:33,340
I'm the morning, you are the light.

1568
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:37,580
You make the morning touch a beautiful thing.

1569
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:42,260
I'm the green grass, you are the red.

1570
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:44,380
Call me, make me go.

1571
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:46,580
No one will let her know.

1572
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:50,780
Call me, make me go again.

1573
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:55,380
I am the spirit, you are the light.

1574
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:59,500
You make the sunshine brighter, you make me smile.

1575
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:04,300
I am the water, you are the road.

1576
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:08,380
Oh, lady, I'm the land, come to me, take my hand.

1577
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:13,260
Until tomorrow I'm your land, step by time we roll me on.

1578
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:18,860
She said, step by time we take me to your bed.

1579
01:57:18,860 --> 01:57:23,260
Step by time we roll on you.

1580
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:27,260
Not you yet to take me on.

1581
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:49,900
I am the darkness, you are the light.

1582
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:54,060
You make the darkness such a beautiful thing.

1583
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:58,860
I am the mountain, you are the snow.

1584
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:00,740
Call me, make me go.

1585
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:03,060
No one will let her know.

1586
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:05,500
Call me, make me go again.

1587
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,900
I am the sun, you are the light.

1588
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:13,740
She said, step by time we take me to your bed.

1589
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:17,980
Step by time we roll on you.

1590
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,620
I am the spirit, you are the light.

1591
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:22,620
Step by time we roll on you.

1592
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:26,260
She said, step by time we roll on you.

1593
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:29,020
Step by time we roll on you.

1594
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:31,020
Yeah, take it to the fridge.

1595
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:32,860
Step by time we take me to your bed.

1596
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:34,860
A little modulation there.

1597
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,580
Step by time we roll on you.

1598
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:41,540
One minute, fifty nine seconds according to the recording area.

1599
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:45,700
I mean, one hour, fifty nine minutes and fifty nine seconds.

1600
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:46,700
Wow.

1601
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:50,300
Okay, I'll tell you what, since there's still so many people checking out the stream

1602
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:53,300
and in the chat room, I'll pop open one more corona.

1603
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:54,300
We'll drink that together.

1604
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,300
How does that sound?

1605
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:57,340
I think that sounds good.

1606
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:02,060
Yeah, I'm a slow drinker, you're in luck.

1607
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:08,060
And keep those requests coming in and know our agenda chat.com.

1608
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:11,860
So we can hold this into a crescendo like you've never seen before.

1609
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:14,460
10 C C that things we do for love.

1610
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:19,140
Too many broken hearts of all and hand the river.

1611
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:23,740
Too many loneliness lies with droopy that I have to see.

1612
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:26,500
You lay your bets and then you pay the price.

1613
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:28,900
The things we do for love.

1614
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:32,900
The things we do for love.

1615
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:35,900
Communication is the problem too.

1616
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,460
I'm sorry.

1617
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:41,940
You've got a number and a hand that's on the floor.

1618
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:43,340
The weather's turned on.

1619
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,860
All the lines have happened.

1620
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:49,340
The things we do for love.

1621
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:52,460
Like walking in the rain and the snow.

1622
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,780
When there's nowhere to go.

1623
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:59,460
When you're feeling like a part of you is dying.

1624
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:04,140
And you're looking for the answer and the right.

1625
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:06,260
You think you're gonna break up.

1626
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:10,140
Then she says she wants to make up.

1627
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:14,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1628
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:19,140

What the hell are they?

1635
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:10,300
Oh man, I missed those guys.

1636
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:11,300
What the hell are they?

1637
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:14,660
Graham, cream, to the god-league, cream.

And this is one that I've been waiting in the wings.

1641
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:25,620
So long!

1642
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:29,180

with the request over here today, like yes.

1644
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:36,820
There's the one I must play, because Philip Bailey, he sings so beautiful, don't you agree?

1645
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:11,820
With the home of mine, reasons, the reasons that we hear.

1646
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:21,060

all our reasons were left.

1651
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:09,900
All the reasons that we never saw.

1652
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:15,660

And to the love game, I'll be played, all our illusions were left.

1656
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:52,940
Oh, reasons, the reasons that we hear.

1657
02:04:52,940 --> 02:05:02,220
The reasons that we fear, I'm given to one, just to be out.

1680

You see, but you know, earth wind and fire, reasons live with Philip Bailey there on vocals.

1681
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:45,340
It's three o'clock in get-mo nation west and there's two things you can always count on when we do a Charlie,

1682
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:49,340
especially the Fubar Friday edition, this being the freedom version of the show.

1683
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:53,340
Ray on the Charlie and of course,

1684

1686
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:11,340
Hello Adam, push notification Kerry.

1687
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:12,340
Hello.

1688
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:14,340
So here is CSB or European correspondent.

1689
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:18,340
So it was a bad quality, but I am recording it on my iPad.

1690
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:24,340
And on which I am getting, by the way, notifications from your big up show.

1691
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:26,340
The system is what works.

1692
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:38,340
And I would like to tell you that unfortunately next week, members of European Parliament will be voting on agreement with USA to give bank information about European citizens to USA.

1693
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:41,340
Yeah, this is the swift thing I talked about at our know agenda.

1694
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:42,340
It's outrageous.

1695
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:48,340
You guys already voted that down once and now they're going to slip it in during the summer when everyone's watching World Cup soccer.

1696
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:50,340
Yeah, watch some soccer.

1697
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:52,340
You stupid slaves.

1698
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:54,340
It's like elimination lowlands.

1699
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:56,340
Has no government almost a month now.

1700
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:58,340
It's not even in the papers anymore.

1701
02:11:58,340 --> 02:11:59,340
It gives a shit.

1702
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:00,340
You don't care.

1703
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:06,340
The Minister of Finance, because I interviewed this guy, he's a IT manager.

1704
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:10,340
And I would like to hear, say, don't vote for this.

1705
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:14,340
If you're listening to it and you're a member of European Parliament, don't vote for this agreement.

1706
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,340
This is a thing.

1707
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:20,340
Yeah, somehow I have a feeling there's not a lot of members of European Parliament listening to the show CSB.

1708
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,340
I hate to pop the bubble.

1709
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:24,340
Isn't against EU citizens.

1710
02:12:24,340 --> 02:12:31,340
And you know, Biden was touting it and it looks like there are slaves.

1711
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:38,340
And I'd listening to you say that they don't have interest of EU citizens at heart.

1712
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:41,340
And was up at you.

1713
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:42,340
Yeah.

1714
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:46,340
Well, there's only one thing I can say to that CSB.

1715
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:50,340
Only one thing.

1716
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:53,340
Everybody who listens to no agenda knows what they have to say.

1717
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:57,340
What?

1718
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:59,340
What?

1719
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:01,340
Say it with me now.

1720
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:05,340
Shut up, slave.

1721
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:12,340
I still hang around.

1722
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:20,340
Neither lost nor found.

1723
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:28,340
Neither lost nor found.

1724
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:31,340
Of news they came the night.

1725
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:36,340
Night for all we pride.

1726
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:42,340
They found the same for me.

1727
02:13:42,340 --> 02:14:00,340
In the morning.

1728
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:06,340

02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:33,280
Yeah.

1935
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:57,280
Yeah.

1936
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:07,280
I give up, it's a mine, I know mine, let's go!

1937

2041
03:10:13,280 --> 03:10:17,280
I can't tell you how much I enjoy doing this show.

2042
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:19,280
That's why I just do it.

2043
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:25,280
I love the chat room, I love the feedback, I love the email I get after I love people who say,

2044
03:10:25,280 --> 03:10:43,280
I can't believe the show, and I got to tell you this new format we've fallen into and the show has changed very much over the past five years from half hour of talking about stuff to all kinds of things.

2045
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:53,280
It's a complete release for me, I really love it, it's not quite like sex, but it's close.

2046
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:58,280
I think the two Corona version of the show works out pretty well.

2047
03:10:58,280 --> 03:11:02,280
Maybe we should try vodka next Friday.

2048
03:11:02,280 --> 03:11:07,280
I'll keep one of the vikodins, we'll try to do that.

2049
03:11:07,280 --> 03:11:11,280
I have a phone call coming in, that's unfortunate timing, let me see.

2050
03:11:11,280 --> 03:11:13,280
If that's anything I need to take.

2051
03:11:13,280 --> 03:11:15,280
It was calling me.

2052
03:11:15,280 --> 03:11:18,280
Clearly not somebody who knows what the hell I'm doing.

2053
03:11:18,280 --> 03:11:21,280
But at the end of the day, none of it all really matters.

2054
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:28,280
It's funny because I have a couple of windows open here on my monitor, and I'm looking at the twit,

2055
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:38,280
IRC chat room, and guys, just all these people who are enslaved to gadgets, thinking about a cool gadget.

2056
03:11:38,280 --> 03:11:46,280
And here we are, we're just jamming out, playing a whole bunch of cool songs, learning some stuff, hearing music we've never heard before,

2057
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:52,280
hearing music we haven't heard in a long time, and hopefully this show has once again become a part of the soundtrack to your life.

2058
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:58,280
And I want to leave you with a song that I think was actually put together by DJ Tom Clay.

2059
03:11:58,280 --> 03:12:04,280
Really sums up what it's all about, and what we really need.

2060
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:13,280
And it will be the last one for this episode of The Charming.

2061
03:12:13,280 --> 03:12:16,280
What is it?

2062
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:19,280
I don't know what decoration is.

2063
03:12:19,280 --> 03:12:21,280
What is bigotry?

2064
03:12:21,280 --> 03:12:23,280
I don't know what bigotry is.

2065
03:12:23,280 --> 03:12:27,280
What does hatred mean?

2066
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:31,280
I don't know what it is.

2067
03:12:31,280 --> 03:12:35,280
What is prejudice?

2068
03:12:35,280 --> 03:12:43,280
And I think it's when it's in my sex.

2069
03:12:43,280 --> 03:12:45,280
I don't care boys.

2070
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:47,280
I don't care.

2071
03:12:47,280 --> 03:12:49,280

I don't care.

2080
03:13:05,280 --> 03:13:07,280
I don't care.

2081
03:13:07,280 --> 03:13:09,280
I don't care.

2082
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:11,280
I don't care.

2083
03:13:11,280 --> 03:13:13,280
I don't care.

2084
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:15,280

2088

2089
03:13:23,280 --> 03:13:25,280
I don't care.

2090
03:13:25,280 --> 03:13:27,280
I don't care.

2091
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:29,280
Anybody?

2092
03:13:29,280 --> 03:13:31,280
Anybody?

2093
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:33,280
We might all pretend.

2094
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:37,280
And you tell me where we go.

2095
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:39,280
Good morning.

2096
03:13:39,280 --> 03:13:41,280
Good morning.

2097
03:13:41,280 --> 03:13:43,280
Good morning.

2098
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:45,280
Good morning.

2099
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:47,280
Good morning.

2100
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:49,280
Good morning.

2101
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:51,280
Good morning.

2102
03:13:51,280 --> 03:13:53,280
Good morning.

2103
03:13:53,280 --> 03:13:55,280
Good morning.

2104
03:13:55,280 --> 03:13:57,280
Good morning.

2105
03:13:57,280 --> 03:13:59,280
Good morning.

2106
03:13:59,280 --> 03:14:01,280
Good morning.

2107
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:03,280
Good morning.

2108
03:14:03,280 --> 03:14:05,280
Good morning.

2109
03:14:05,280 --> 03:14:07,280
We can't say who has been here and anybody has been here.

2110
03:14:07,280 --> 03:14:09,280
But it's nothing as long as something is there.

2111
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:11,280
We won't.

2112
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:13,280
I'm in behind the morning case.

2113
03:14:13,280 --> 03:14:15,280
The phone is not going to happen.

2114
03:14:15,280 --> 03:14:19,280
The interruptives program to bring you a special bulletin.

2115
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:21,280
Gallows Texas.

2116
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:23,280
The flash, apparently official.

2117
03:14:23,280 --> 03:14:27,280
President John F. Kevin died.

2118
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:29,280
At 1 p.m.

2119
03:14:29,280 --> 03:14:31,280
Central Stanford Times.

2120
03:14:35,280 --> 03:14:39,280
It seems my husband watches.

2121
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:43,280
And you tell me where he goes.

2122
03:14:43,280 --> 03:14:47,280
He's breathing a lot of people.

2123
03:14:47,280 --> 03:14:49,280
But it seems good they die now.

2124
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:51,280
That's a cold day for him.

2125
03:14:51,280 --> 03:14:53,280
But if he doesn't matter with me now.

2126
03:14:53,280 --> 03:14:55,280
Because I've been to the mountain top.

2127
03:14:55,280 --> 03:14:57,280
I don't know.

2128
03:14:57,280 --> 03:14:59,280
I don't know.

2129
03:14:59,780 --> 03:15:01,280
I don't know.

2130
03:15:03,280 --> 03:15:05,280
I look like somebody.

2131
03:15:09,280 --> 03:15:11,280
No one can be certainty who next with stuffer

2132
03:15:11,280 --> 03:15:13,280
from some senseless act of bloodshed.

2133
03:15:13,280 --> 03:15:14,280
Let's get it.

2134
03:15:14,280 --> 03:15:26,280
Anybody here, see my old friend Bobby, can you tell me where he's going?

2135
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:31,280
There you are, it's just that the image that you've been here too long already.

2136
03:15:31,280 --> 03:15:38,280
So well, I thank all of you and I'm going to Chicago and let's win now.

2137
03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:39,280
I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you

2138
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:38,280
what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going just to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you this time what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you. So let's welcome you back out there tomorrow and see what you're going to tell me, and he will tell you what I'm going to tell you, as you put some credit and give me credit in back there for me, for me you are going to tell me what I'm going to tell you what you are going to tell you what you want I'm going to tell you what I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to tell you. What I'm going to tell you all

2139
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:50,280
So wrong and tried to write it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war, tried to stop it.

2140
03:16:50,280 --> 03:17:01,280
Those of us love them, and okay, him do his rest today, pray that what he was, was, what he wished for others,

2141
03:17:01,280 --> 03:17:05,280
was some day come to pass for all the world.

2142
03:17:05,280 --> 03:17:15,280
As he said many times, many parts of his nation, those he touched, and who sought to touch him.

2143
03:17:15,280 --> 03:17:25,280
Some men see things as they are and say why, I dream things that never were and say why not.

2144
03:17:25,280 --> 03:17:29,280
What is the occasion?

2145
03:17:29,280 --> 03:17:47,280
What is the occasion?

2146
03:17:47,280 --> 03:17:55,280
What is the occasion?

2147
03:17:55,280 --> 03:17:59,280
I don't know what to say to raise to this.

2148
03:17:59,280 --> 03:18:01,280
What is big a tree?

2149
03:18:01,280 --> 03:18:03,280
I don't know what a tree is.

2150
03:18:03,280 --> 03:18:07,280
What does hatred mean?

2151
03:18:07,280 --> 03:18:11,280
I don't know.

2152
03:18:11,280 --> 03:18:15,280
What is prejudice?

2153
03:18:15,280 --> 03:18:20,280
I think it's when some of my sick.

2154
03:18:20,280 --> 03:18:23,280
And that wraps up episode 837 of the Daily Source Code.

2155
03:18:23,280 --> 03:18:28,280
The Freedom Food Bar Friday edition was produced with the help of hundreds of chuckleheads worldwide,

2156
03:18:28,280 --> 03:18:31,280
re-birthing the art of radio on the internet.

2157
03:18:31,280 --> 03:18:38,280
May I live to be 100 each of you 100 in a day, so I never have to see my friends pass away until next time,

2158
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:43,280
live your life with passion, and as long as it lasts, enjoy your freedom.

2159
03:18:43,280 --> 03:18:45,280
Another fine, medial presentation.

2160
03:18:45,280 --> 03:18:47,280
Stick it in your ear.
