00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie eight four zero.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
With 16 minutes to 7 minutes,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
ensuring five lines of time.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Turn.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The 25th century of radio starts here.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are being lost.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Keep increasing in the alive.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I know a gender strip.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm fantastic.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Here's Adam Curry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey, hello to my little friend.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Adam Curry, another baby source quote.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right, everybody.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is officially quick and time.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's the deadliest source quote you've ever tried.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It is the end of the month.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's quick and time.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If they do you, I saw you again.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today, I have to turn my heart away.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Smile like this, son.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Jesus will raise you.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If Jesus never leaves.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you lie, smile like this.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I feel like you're not involved in it.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can't be helped.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can't live like this.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can't live like this.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's no good job.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000

All right, you're the right, no wrong

Whisk the game

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And if you're real, then don't do it to it

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You better leave up something to me

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You better go to time, we'll come all the way

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ooh, barracuda

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, you're the right, no wrong

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000

Serious souls can be my new

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Real souls don't do it to it

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You better leave up something to me

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You better go to time, we'll come all the way

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000

Serious souls can be my new

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I gotta tell you, there's nothing like banging the Wilson sisters out on a Friday afternoon

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000

You're right, hips, easy to live in.

This is a thing I've never known before, it's called Easy Living.

116
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,680
This is a place I've never seen before, and I've been forgiven.

117
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Easy Living, and I've been forgiven since you've tried the last place in my heart.

This is a thing I've never seen before, it's called Easy Living.

So disown yourself face.

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:43,680
This is a weird thing I've never seen before, it's called Easy Living, and I've been forgiven since you've tried the last place in my heart.

operating, we've got easy living, you're right, he's on the Charlie episode,

128
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
a 40-foot-year-old football Friday, coming to you from the hilltop watch tower

129
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,680
crackpot command sends in the People's Republic of Southern California in the morning to

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,320
y'all, taking it down to get my nation lowlands, again most of this by request just

131
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,760
sent in an email, you guys know what I want to play, that's for sure, so now we're on the

132
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
same frequency, like this one from the hearing.

133
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,200
Hey, I big time the fear's like me, they're shaking, it doesn't matter,

134
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,240
I say it's falling, I hear a shout, maybe it's raining, that's too fast,

135
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,800
shadows dance, I am the morning, you're not gonna blow away I'm the feeling of

136
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,040
the gain, the love, the love

137
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm not A love, you scream, you're not When the solace of one beats off the floor,

138
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,680
For another shot, we got the feeling and a feeling of pride

139
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,680
When the lady smiles, she holds me in her hand

140
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,680
That's a matter of fact, she could always let me down

141
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,680
The lady smiles, I can't resist her cold

142
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
As a matter of fact, I don't exist at all

143
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,680
As a matter of fact, she is leaving away

144
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,680
My friends tell me, she used to be still so much a pair of dice

145
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,680
I guess you've heard it all before

146
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Before an angel, that has got to hear my size

147
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I'm not always need some more

148
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
And I'm not in

149
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Yeah, I love it

150
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,680
She's not nothing to me, it's me

151
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
It's every time we meet the girl, this shaking

152
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,680
It doesn't matter of course, it's falling

153
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
I hear a shadow, maybe it's raining

154
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
That's your faster, she'll go dancing

155
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Together we're alive

156
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680

157
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680

My better lover is gonna come out

159
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,680
When the balls know how much I've got

160
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
But I'm in a feeling of pride

161
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,680
When the lady smiles, she holds me in her hand

162
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
When I'm in a battle of fact, she could always let me down

163
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
When the lady smiles, she holds me in her hand

164
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
I can't resist her job

165
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,680
As a matter of fact, I don't resist at all

166
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,680

Damn, front the roses, you just don't hear that shit

232
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
I don't know anyone anymore, this is nuts

233
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Paradise City, G&R, on the Charlie

234
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,480
The wilder's of the airways is landed, and he's sounding good to me

235
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,480
This is the Daily Source Code, with Adam Curry

236
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Don't call it a comeback, I've been here for years

237
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm rockin' my feet, what's up with the fear?

238
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Raking the tears, rain down like a blind soul

239
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's until a beast go boom, it's bulging

240
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Overpowering, over the competition, outpowering, wreckage down

Don't you dare stare, you better move

243
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Don't ever come here, be till the rest that I all get sliced in dice

244
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,480

251
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Call some kisses, watch me fast, just read like a skull

252
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
That's what I hate being with, why do you risk with me?

253
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,480
The man he acts like gold, and when I pull out my game again

254
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Then they got their mind, don't blouse

255
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,480

So you can say I'm tapped in, oh English to my mind

Oh.

273
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,980
Man is in the parking area now.

274
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,740
Man is in the parking area for the runs.

275
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,460
Man is up here.

276
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,600
Man is in the parking area already.

277
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,620
Man and Hillary happen to get theily records on

278
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,140
that the jackets that they threw up,-

279
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,260
Ass, you can't drive me for何 part of the design.

280
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,160
Oh!

281
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,320
"...facing the wetroy45, ready groundbreaking Smash Bros.]

282
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,040
Man is in the first corner running!

283
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Two for the price of one here on the daily source code. I kind of like that. It was a little intense little twisted LL cool Jay and Dexy's midnight runners a DJ lobster dust mash up

284
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Haven't played one of those in a long time happy to have him back in on the show. So I've been in a crazy mad out of control rush the past two weeks.

285
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Yeah, I guess it's now officially what is it's the third week since we've been together my friends crap all on so sorry, but all that's going to change very soon.

286
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:47,040
First of all, I had the the pod daughter over for two weeks, which was great to have her here. Of course, when you have the kid in the house and she's got no wheels you function partially as

287
00:27:48,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Show for banker chef, you know, all things in one, but oh man, it was so much fun to have her here. She's doing so well and particularly with her writing stuff, which I'm very excited about. But that of course preoccupied me then we went off to San Francisco. She wanted to see some of her friends up there up north and I went along of course to check in on the folks at the media office to see how things are going.

288
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I've been busted my ass on the big app show in the next few weeks will be more news about that, but basically an episode every single day and you know what, it's a lot of work.

289
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:39,040
I was laughing people like, oh, you should do an episode of this, an episode of that. It's you know, I forget sometimes I make it look easy, but when you're doing it all yourself, I'm basically doing the work of four people, but in order to make it actually work, I've got to

290
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:48,040
be kind of small and slim right now. And so I had to pre-produce a whole bunch of stuff because Miss Mickey and I are leaving tomorrow for the Netherlands and Tiles.

291
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I think it's a Dutch and Tiles or Netherlands and Tiles. I'm not sure.

292
00:28:52,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Friend of mine from my past has built a house there and said, hey, once you guys come on down and stay for a little bit, you know, the house is built so that we won't even bump into each other.

293
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:16,040
So I'm looking very much, we're looking forward to that. So that means that there will not be a show next week, but upon my return, there might be more than a show a week.

294
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,040
And I will tell you all about it after this.

295
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Got to get you into the right mood for the news, you know, a little bit of B3 Hammond with man for man.

296
00:29:49,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Everybody is building ships and boats, some of the buildings, many boats, some of the top and down boats.

297
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Everybody is in the space and we're going to land more. We're going to get to see everybody going to charge a show.

298
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Come on without. Come on with it. You're not seen nothing like the mighty wind. Come on without. Come on with it.

299
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:43,040
You're not seen nothing like the mighty wind.

300
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Let me do what I want to do, a lot much of a sweep.

301
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Come on with it. You're not seen nothing like the mighty wind. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it.

302
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:33,040
You're not seen nothing like the mighty wind. Come on without. Come on with it. You're not seen nothing like the mighty wind.

303
00:31:47,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it.

304
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it.

306
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Come on. with it. Come with it. Come with it. Come on with it. Come out with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on. Come with it. Come on with it. Come. With it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on. Come on with it. Come on. Let's do it. Let's do it. Come on. Let's do it. Come on, let's do it. Come along with it. Come on with it. Come with it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on with it. Come with it. Come on with it. Come on with it. Come on. Ready. Come with it. Come on with it. Come with it. Take a car. Come on. Come on. Come with it.

307
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:38,560
Let me do what I want to do, like my sugar sweet, but you're meant to use a makin' taste,

308
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:50,400
ain't my company, nobody can get no sleep, so I want to let the ones go, but we need to move it to everybody gonna wanna do,

309
00:34:50,400 --> 00:35:02,040
come on without, come on with it, you're not seeing nothing like the mighty man, come on without,

310
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:12,040
come on with it, you're not seeing nothing like the mighty man, come on without,

311
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:24,040
come on with it, you're not seeing nothing like the mighty man, come on with it,

312
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:33,060
welcome home, welcome home, hahaha, ah, they're my exercise for today, Matt Romands Earthzban,

313
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:40,820
the mighty queen, of course, about queen the Eschimo, so you know that for the past two and

314
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,320
a half years John and I have been new in No agenda, no agenda show dot com and of course that is expanded entre

315
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,960
quite an amazing project and we believe that we can actually do that well, I don't know full time

316
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,560
we have other interests, but we can certainly devote more time to it. My main problem has

317
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,800
been for the past five years, I've been President of Mio. And I'm about to perform an

318
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,880
aerobatic trick in the business world that is known as the Slow Exit, which essentially

319
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:19,440
means I stay connected to the company as a, what do you call it, Consultant? And I actually

320
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:27,360
will, and I do consult with the company, but I will have no more managerial duties or really

321
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,800
much to do with the company other than shepherding it where I can and of course promoting it

322
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:40,640
where I can. That does have some consequences. The main one is I'll stop receiving a salary.

323
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,280
Of course, that money is better purpose or repurposed towards someone who actually can

324
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,720
help and participate and my partner Ron Bloom will be assuming the duties that I had and he'll

325
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,360
be bringing in some other people to take care of that so that I can focus on three main things,

326
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:04,640
which is of course this program, Daily Source Code, which of course is no agenda and the big

327
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,320
app show, but I'm going to have to hustle. That's for sure. Unless I get lucky and sell the aircraft,

328
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,000
it's going to get tied after a while. So I'll be counting on your support. Primarily the

329
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,320
the main thing you can do is help promote no agenda, get more people to listen, more people to support

330
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,840
the show, as well as the big app show. That's really the main things. And of course the other

331
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:37,360
consequence that it has is I'm free. Yes, I'm completely a free man to do what I want. I love it.

332
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,960
The feeling is astounding, amazing. I'd recommend it highly with everybody. It's kind of scary.

333
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,160
Fuck, that's part of the joy. And I noticed Marcus Couch sent in the perfect song to celebrate

334
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:12,080
atomic time to rain and free. I couldn't put with that a page, nothing other on the wall.

335
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:25,440
Right, the cup of tires games we play, I'm not afraid to get on and on.

336
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:41,920
Right, and every corset had to pay the time and not to freedom.

337
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,320
Oh...

338
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,920
Right...

339
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:59,440
Nothing more they'll have a day but they'll depend on our blood, we step from inside

340
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,440
I'm not afraid

341
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,440
I'm not aware of stuff to me

342
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,440
I'm not afraid to let you know

343
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,440
I'm not afraid

344
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I'm not who I used to make

345
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm not afraid to let you know

346
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm not afraid to let you know

347
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm not afraid to let you know

348
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,440
I'm not afraid to let you know

349
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
My understanding, behind theに

350
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,440
I take a breath

351
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,440
It's been really hard to let sing old

352
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,440
And I will teach you a tune

353
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
No back on the inside

354
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,440
But not free

355
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,440
But now it's supposed to make

356
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,440
But not free to let you own

357
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,440
But not me

358
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
But not me

359
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
If you made

360
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,440
But not free to let you own

361
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,440
But not free, but you own

362
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Back home inside

363
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Try it out

364
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm going to let's miss

365
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Look, try to save me

366
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
I'll be a better night

367
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Just to let it go

368
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

369
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

370
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Chatroom, of course, buzzing with questions

371
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Happy to answer them

372
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
But it's pretty simple

373
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
It's not that crazy

374
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Founding partners do this

375
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
From time to time

376
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
I've probably two years past my due date

377
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,440
And the amazing thing, you know, when you

378
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
When you, while they say proverbially

379
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
When you close a door

380
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Another one opens

381
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Oh my god

382
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,440
So many things have happened

383
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,440
And just the past week alone

384
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
So many exciting things

385
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
No change in my pocket yet

386
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,440
But I hooked up with the director extraordinaire

387
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
He like Rob

388
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,440
He's actually got a movie coming out

389
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
The end of August

390
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
And we're working on a project

391
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Which I think will blow your socks off

392
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
I'm very excited about that

393
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Just tons of stuff

394
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,440
All potential of course

395
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
You make your own luck

396
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
And luck has always thought of the intersection

397
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Between preparation

398
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
An opportunity

399
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,440
And that's where I plan to be

400
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Sweet berries ready for your ghosts

401
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
You're not different than you

402
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Ghosts are now waiting for you

403
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Are you dreaming

404
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Dreaming in the night

405
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Dreaming all right

406
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,440
You're waiting for me

407
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,440
When we fly

408
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,440
When we go

409
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Do we fly

410
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
So many berries ready for your ghosts

411
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,440
No different than you

412
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Ghosts are now waiting for you

413
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
Are you

414
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Sweet berries ready for your ghosts

415
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
No different than you

416
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,440
Ghosts are now waiting for you

417
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Are you dreaming

418
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Dreaming in the night

419
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Dreaming all right

420
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,440
You're waiting for me

421
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,440
When we fly

422
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,440
When we go

423
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,440
Do we fly

424
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,440
So many berries ready for your ghosts

425
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
No different than you

426
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Ghosts are now waiting for you

427
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Are you dreaming in the night

428
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Dreaming in the night

429
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
Dreaming in the night

430
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
Dreaming in the night

431
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Dreaming in the night

432
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Dreaming in the night

433
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Dreaming in the night

434
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Dreaming in the night

435
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Dreaming in the night

436
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Dreaming in the night

437
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Dreaming in the night

438
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Dreaming in the night

439
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Dreaming in the night

440
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Dreaming in the night

441
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Dreaming in the night

442
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Dreaming in the night

443
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Dreaming in the night

444
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Dreaming in the night

445
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
Dreaming in the night

446
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Dreaming in the night

447
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Dreaming in the night

448
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
Dreaming in the night

449
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Dreaming in the night

450
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Dreaming in the night

451
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Dreaming in the night

452
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,440
Dreaming in the night

453
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
Dreaming in the night

454
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Dreaming in the night

455
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Dreaming in the night

456
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Dreaming in the night

457
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
Dreaming in the night

458
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Dreaming in the night

459
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Dreaming in the night

460
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Dreaming in the night

461
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Dreaming in the night

462
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Dreaming in the night

463
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Dreaming in the night

464
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,680
Number of listening to is 840 live at nogenoustreme.com and of course on the podcast of

465
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,280
dailysourcecode.com, fun to see the chat room coming up with all kinds of business

466
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,960
I can use for all of these.

467
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,640
Whoa, yeah, but it's okay.

468
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,160
I've got three businesses already, you know, and the big app show is a real business.

469
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,160
What I need there is I need 10 times the amount of viewers, I got about 150,000 now integrating

470
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:43,960
I adds into that soon, but I just need more people, I make blog posts, send me the URL,

471
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,600
I need to get some viral love going there, that's really what'll make that happen because

472
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:55,400
people who have the app absolutely adore it, just needs more exposure, and I'll be working

473
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,440
on that as well, more news after we play some guest here, when the band was singing,

474
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:09,640
she could snorkeling, snorkeling, and I tried to do the dailysourcecode, she smiled while we were

475
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:15,000
scrolling, and I knew that I was rolling, and I told her I'd be bored of the new.

476
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:30,280
It's not the magic, it's not the music, it's not the moonlight, I don't know where I'd love

477
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:44,840
like this before, about 10 years time ago, when the band was singing, shaking all over

478
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:53,000
up, when the band was singing, shaking all over

479
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,480
up, and I'll make people choose illusion, we did the one, two, three, and I'll rock and bear a boost

480
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,880
way too, once you don't know, I won't hurt her even though I might disobey her, got to tell

481
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:24,520
my best body the new, it's not the magic, it's not the music, it's not the moonlight, I don't know

482
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:34,600
where I'd be gone, it's not the magic, it's not the time before, about 10 years ago,

483
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:56,440
when the band was singing, shaking all over, when the band was singing, shaking all over

484
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:11,640
up, it's not the music, it's not the moonlight, I don't know where I'd be gone, it's not the moonlight, I don't know

485
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:29,880
how I'd be gone, like this before, about 10 years time ago, when the band was singing, shaking all over

486
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:43,160
up, when the band was singing, shaking all over, when the band was singing, shaking all over,

487
00:48:43,240 --> 00:49:00,520
I'm out there plugging the crap out of the big app show, you can do the same by linking to

488
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:06,760
bigappshow.com for the iPhone challenge, it might even persuade you to get an iPhone, I've actually

489
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:15,560
started working on a Android version of it, which has been an interesting little challenge,

490
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:22,600
man, when you just feel the Android, using a droid for development, it just feels a little

491
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,960
wonky, it really is the difference between a PC and a Mac, but now there you go, what can you

492
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,600
do? So one of the things I'm doing was actually I got helped out by one of our

493
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,880
no agenda listeners, I don't know if she's in the chat room, sit us an X, and she actually

494
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,000
sent in an audio comment to tell you all about what's going on. Hello, Anna, my name is Barbara,

495
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,240
Barbara, I'm probably known me better as a citizen X, and I wanted to say thank you for

496
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:53,880
committing to do the interview with Carrie Holsman, I'm really looking forward to it, it's going

497
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,520
to be a great opportunity for you, it's a live chat, but also a Colin Show. So I'm trying to promote

498
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:07,480
the show so that your fans can actually Colin and perhaps talk to you, I think that's going

499
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:14,600
to be a great opportunity for them, but also I know how busy you are, I know you could have

500
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:23,800
said no, but I just wanted to say thank you, personally thank you for saying yes, and for appearing

501
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:29,160
at Computer America on the 30th, looking forward to it, can't wait, I would like to say in the

502
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:36,680
morning, but in this instance it's in the evening. Yeah, I love you, mean it. See you soon. Okay,

503
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,080
sit us next there, I don't know why you're thanking me, I'm thanking you for hooking me up, it's great,

504
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:47,080
it's a thing is a national radio show, it's on a lot of AM stations around the country that starts

505
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:53,080
at 7 o'clock this evening, Pacific Standard Time, and I'm actually contemplating streaming my

506
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,880
end of it live, which would be kind of fun. So that is tonight, I check your local listings,

507
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,200
I guess, to find out where it's on. And thank you very much, Barbara, for hooking me up with that

508
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:09,880
opportunity, I really love it. To me, it's like, hey, get the work out. Oh god, damn, it's just funky.

509
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:18,280
It's really rocks my boat, boss gags, chill out, I'm Friday afternoon with my friends and no

510
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:24,680
agenda chat.com, so we stream out to the new radios around the world, bring it back to the

511
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,200
arc of the radio, so load down on the charming.

512
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:56,920
Good to say, it's a treat, you've done it all down.

513
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:25,000
Nothing you can't handle, nothing you ain't got. Put your money on the table, drive it up and

514
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,080
up. Turn on that old love life, turn to make it do you have the same old school bargain, got you

515
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:42,680
when it is fair. But get on back and down, raise your saddle, turn it all down.

516
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:15,560
Come back and listen.

517
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:31,200
Look, don't yell, don't yell,

518
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:44,080
You ain't got to be so bad, got to be so cold

519
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,080
This doggy dog is just a show that I get no

520
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,080
Got to have a joke with this, just for that

521
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:57,080
But this runger with the dumplings raw just ain't where it's at

522
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,080
You're gonna come back around to say it's at you

523
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
You're telling all the damn

524
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,080
Got you thinking like that boy

525
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Got to have a joke with this, just for that

526
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:45,080
You're gonna come back around to say it's at you

527
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Got to have a joke with this, just for that

528
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,080
And that's it, just for that

529
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:57,080
You're gonna come back around to say it's at you

530
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,080
I don't want to want to go

531
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,080
I don't want to want to go

532
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,080
Got you, baby

533
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,080
Got you, baby

534
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,080
Let it go, baby

535
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,080
And share it with me

536
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,080
I don't want to want to go

537
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,080
I don't want to go

538
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,080
I don't want to go

539
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:37,080
I don't want to go

540
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,080
I think California kid and the chat room

541
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,080
I know it's in the chat.com nailed it

542
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,080
This is totally top down, cruising around

543
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Your Lincoln Continental

544
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,080
A Hollywood Boulevard

545
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
With a low down

546
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,080
Nice

547
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
Yeah, I got to find me a cheapest car

548
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,080
car too.

549
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,080
That's scary shit, man.

550
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,080
He's like, all right, I'll drop my responsibility, drop the paycheck.

551
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,480
Of course, I've got the Delta Shara as like some meager form of insurance policy, back

552
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,480
and everything up.

553
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,280
Can always sell it for 50 grand.

554
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,640
I know I can find a microphone for that, but that would be a, I would be kind of a shame

555
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,640
wouldn't it.

556
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,640
No worries.

557
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:27,200
Going to be the race to poverty and starvation, or can we make something out of these

558
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,200
lemons, eh?

559
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,440
I see nothing but upside, that's for sure.

560
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,440
By request, came in a couple of times through email in the chat room, Lighthouse,

561
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,040
one five fine morning on the Charming.

562
00:56:51,640 --> 00:57:21,600
One five morning girl, I'll wake up, watch it from my eyes, what's on it, feel a sunshine,

563
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:29,600
then I know I'll be your lies, where there's long as you love me go far.

564
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:46,600
You're on that moment when I wake up, see a face inside a cloud, see a smile inside a window,

565
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:53,600
here your voices out of crowd calling come with me baby and the fly.

566
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:05,600
Yeah, the fly, yeah, the fly, yeah, the fly.

567
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Yeah, the fly, yeah, the fly, yeah, the fly.

568
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:30,600
And on that morning when I wake up, we'll go outside and live our dreams, but by can we stay to start us,

569
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:41,600
when little dogs are stuffed in the wind, and everywhere they go, we'll laugh and sing, but this is morning good night,

570
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:52,600
and all the universe was smart on us, because they know that I love this fact right.

571
00:58:53,600 --> 00:59:01,600
Yeah, the fly, yeah, the fly, yeah, the fly.

572
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:15,600
And on that morning when I wake up, we'll go outside and live our dreams, but by can we stay to start us,

573
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,600
Oh, yeah, we'll fly to the north, we'll fly to the shore

574
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,600
If you wear it, we'll become our home

575
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Oh, yeah, we'll do it way more

576
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,600
Oh, yeah, we'll do it way more

577
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly

578
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, yeah we fly, here we fly, here the fly, here we fly, here, we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here's we fly, here we fly, here we fly, there we fly, here we fly, there we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here, fly, here we fly, there we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here, we fly, here we fly, here we fly, there you fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, now you fly, there you fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, there we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we fly, here we

579
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,300
I'm just leaving, I'm amazing.

580
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,940
You've been with me at the castle, at the cottage.

581
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,340
You've been with me through the passing of my mom,

582
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,740
through a divorce, a new life.

583
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,340
It's great.

584
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,020
And I'm amazed at how many of you are actually friends

585
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,820
that I know a lot about as well.

586
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,820
It's nice.

587
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,460
I can love that.

588
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,820
Particularly when I look outside,

589
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,320
when I see the sun shining in Southern California,

590
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,420
they can do myself, hey, you know what?

591
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,420
The government doesn't know in the sun.

592
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:37,100
Yet, here's a guy who started off pot safe

593
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,620
and is doing okay for himself.

594
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,540
It's now an iTunes.

595
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:45,500
I love this track, Bob Gendry, upside down on 840.

596
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,940
Now, I've been talking in my ass lately

597
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,740
when I'm waking, well, my tongue is tight.

598
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,740
I've been thinking I should leave,

599
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,740
instead of waiting for her when the time is right.

600
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:04,740
I've backed the bags under my eyes,

601
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,740
well, I've seen enough to know what it's like.

602
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,740
It's turning me up.

603
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,740
It's turning me up.

604
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,740
It's turning me up.

605
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,740
It's turning me up.

606
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,740
It's turning me up.

607
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,740
It's turning me up.

608
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,740
It's turning me up.

609
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,740
It's turning me up.

610
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,740
It's turning me up.

611
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,740
It's turning me up.

612
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,740
It's turning me up.

613
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,740
It's turning me up.

614
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,740
It's turning me up.

615
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,740
It's turning me up.

616
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,740
It's turning me up.

617
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,740
It's turning me up.

618
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,740
It's turning me up.

619
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,740
It's turning me up.

620
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,740
It's turning me up.

621
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,740
It's turning me up.

622
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,740
It's turning me up.

623
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,740
I've turned me up.

624
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,740
I've turned me up.

625
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,740
I've turned me white again.

626
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,740
I'm done wrong now.

627
01:02:49,740 --> 01:03:08,740
I've been walking in my sleep when I'm waking up

628
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,740
Well, my legs are tight

629
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:20,740
I've been thinking I should breathe, put the window up

630
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,740
It's a marathon

631
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:31,740
I've been dreaming I could fly it

632
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,740
Well, I'm free enough, but I'm still way down

633
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,740
It's turning me upside down

634
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,740
Tell me what I've done wrong now

635
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,740
All I can do is try it

636
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,740
When everything's breaking me down

637
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,740
Looking at the inside out

638
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,740
Well, those rules got changed somehow

639
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,740
Maybe it's suicide

640
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,740
To stay here and just stick around

641
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:07,740
I was able to hide every bruised on my body too now

642
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:12,740
Until now

643
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:18,740
I've been afraid to just walk out

644
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:23,740
And you know where to stop me now

645
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,740
It's turning me upside down

646
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,740
Tell me what I've done wrong now

647
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,740
All I can do is try it

648
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,740

651
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,740
Maybe it's suicide

652
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,740
When everything's breaking me down

653
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,740

654
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,740
Well, those rules got changed somehow

655
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,740
Maybe it's suicide

656
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,740
To stay here and just stick around

657
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:05,740
I was able to hide every bruised on my body too now

658
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,740
Until now

659
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,740
Tell me what I've done wrong now

660
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,740
All I can do is try it

661
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,740

662
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,740
I was able to hide every bruised on my body too

663
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,740
I was able to hide every bruised on my body too

664
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,740
I was able to hide every bruised on my body

665
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,740
Until now

666
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,740
Upside down

667
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,740
Bob Gentry on the Charlie

668
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,740
By the way, if you go to know agenda

669
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:35,740
Entertainment.com

670
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,740
That's where you can find the playlist

671
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,740
With associated links to iTunes

672
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,740
For all the songs played on the show

673
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,740
And of course, you can just sound hounded

674
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,740
Or shazam that shit that always seems to work

675
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,740
And for one hit to another

676
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,740
You know, remember when you heard this song

677
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,740
All the time on the radio

678
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,740
And that of course, it just went away

679
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,740
Because the guy's name is Bruce Hornsby

680
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,740
And that Bruce Hornsby JC

681
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,740
It's kind of the way the music business works these days

682
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,740
Luckily, we've got radios in our pockets now

683
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,740
With our smartphones

684
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:11,740
Turn up your speakers

685
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,740
For the way it is

686
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:37,740
Still in line, looking time waiting for all of their day

687
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,740
Stay kept by our job

688
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,740
Man, it's so surreal

689
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,740
He's biased, he keeps falling ladies eyes

690
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,740
Just for funny sets

691
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,740
Get a job

692
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:54,740
That's just the way it is

693
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,740
Some things I've never seen

694
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,740
That's just the way it is

695
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,740
How but don't you believe that

696
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,740
Say it in my, you can't go without this cold

697
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,740
You don't look like they do

698
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:28,740
Say, hell man, how can you stand the thing that way

699
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,740
That you really think about it

700
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,740
Before you make a move

701
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,740
Just a stitch

702
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,740
Let's just the way it is

703
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,740

Super talented guy and just incredibly nice.

771
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,500
I've actually mismicked it to me a total solid.

772
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:21,220
She's having all of my old pictures framed and she had them all scanned in and actually put

773
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,100
up two pictures of on my flicker account the other day.

774
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:28,740
One with me and Rundian C and the Leastie boys and me with Tina Turner and a lot more

775
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,740
to come.

776
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:33,180
I think I've got some Bruce Hornsby pictures somewhere, so I actually find them.

777
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:37,420
It's interesting when you announce something like this, like my aerobatic move, the

778
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:38,420
soft exit.

779
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,420
All of a sudden, all the songs in the world just sound so relevant.

780
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,540
Like, oh yeah, that one kind of fits the mood too, doesn't it?

781
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,640
Oh this is crazy!

782
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:57,240
My last one, Jeopardy!

783
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,460
Is it ready?

784
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:07,460
You can not be found, what can I do?

785
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:14,460
What I believe in you, you're running me around

786
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,460
You can change it as I want it

787
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,460
I'm taking any way you like

788
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:27,460
It's a slayer, not the funer

789
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,460
You never know what it's gonna start

790
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,460
I love you, Jeffery

791
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,460
Baby

792
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,460
I love you, Jeffery

793
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,460
Baby

794
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,460
Don't get you

795
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,460
Don't get fun enough

796
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,460
It's way that then you think

797
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,460
Or it's the use

798
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,460
I'll save your mind now

799
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,460
It's hanging on the bed

800
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,460
Don't let go

801
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,460
While I'm hanging on

802
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:15,460
Cos I did, I'm hanging on too long

803
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:20,460
It's so hard to keep all alone

804
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,460
I know you're not that strong

805
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,460
Yeah, yeah

806
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,460
I love you, Jeffery

807
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,460
Baby

808
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,460
I love you, Jeffery

809
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,460
Baby

810
01:12:53,460 --> 01:13:16,460
Don't let go

811
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:19,460
Don't let go

812
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,460
Want I'll pay And I'll go softer

813
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:24,460
Pay And I'll be strong

814
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,460
It's summer, to be more low

815
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,460
I know you knocked that strump

816
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,460
Yeah, yeah, Oh the cigarettes

817
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,460

01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:42,460

823
01:14:46,460 --> 01:15:05,460
I'm just an average man with an average life

824
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,460
I'm from nine to five

825
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,460
Hey, hell, I paid the price

826
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,460
I want you to be left alone

827
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,460
In my average home

828
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,460
But why do I always feel

829
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,460
I get mad in the twilight soon

830
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,460
And I always feel like

831
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,460
Somebody's watching me

832
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,460
And I love your price

833
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:26,460
And I go, I always feel like

834
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,460
Somebody's watching me

835
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,460
Tell me, is it just a dream?

836
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,460
When I'm a criminal

837
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,460
I've been through a real time

838
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:42,460
People call me on the phone

839
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,460
Trying to avoid me

840
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,460
Look at the people who don't really see me

841
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,460
When I'm a criminal

842
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,460
When I'm in the shower

843
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,460
I'm afraid to watch my hair

844
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,460
Because I'm out of a mind

845
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,460
And there's someone standing there

846
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,460
People say I'm crazy

847
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,460
Just a little touch

848
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,460
But maybe I wouldn't mind me

849
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,460
I'll fight for you

850
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,460
But that's why

851
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,460
I always feel like

852
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,460
Somebody's watching me

853
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,460
And I love your price

854
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:13,460
And I go, I always feel like

855
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,460
Somebody's watching me

856
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,460
Who's playing tricks only

857
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:52,460
Whatever

858
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:56,460
Anything

859
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,960
You can imagine

860
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,460
And I don't feel safe

861
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,460
And I don't know what I'm up

862
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,460
And I wonder who's watching me now

863
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,460
The ARL

864
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,460
I love this feel

865
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,460
Somebody's watching me

866
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:18,460
And I look no better, oh I always be loving somebody's one to me

867
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:21,460
Tell me you're just a dream boy

868
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:26,460
I always be loving somebody's one to me

869
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:34,460
And I look no better, oh I always be loving somebody's one to me

We might stay

878
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,460

879
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:44,460
So I just want to meet

880
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,460
Get out of my privacy

So I just want to meet

883
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,460

885
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:59,460
So I just want to meet

886
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,460

So I just want to meet

892
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:16,460
Rockwell

893
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,460
Michael Jackson back in it up

894
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,460
Somebody's watching me on the Charlie

895
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,460
Interesting conversation going on in the

896
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,460
The chat room

897
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,460
So funny

898
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,460
Comics are bloggers in there

899
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,460
Trying to calculate how much time

900
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,460
It takes to do the big app show

901
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,460
Oh yeah

902
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,460
So there are three minutes each

903
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,460
So by the way

904
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,460
It's not five a week

905
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,460
It's seven a week

906
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:36,460
Yeah that's 21 minutes

907
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,460
Yeah that's how long it takes

908
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,460
Yeah that's right

909
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,460
There's nothing else involved

910
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,460
No editing

911
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,460
No setup

912
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,460
Ha ha ha

913
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:43,460
Shmuck

914
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,460
Shmuck

915
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,460

I don't agree

928
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,460
I don't agree

929
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,460
I don't agree

930
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,460
I don't agree

931
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,460

I don't agree

933
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,460
I don't agree

934
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,460
I don't agree

935
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,460
I'm a real good

936
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:28,460
I don't agree

937
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
I don't agree

938
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,460
I don't agree

939
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:36,460
And it was coming through my heart

940
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:39,460
And it was coming there was looking there was candy

941
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,460
Orange long dog glasses with wine up to a yard

942
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:48,460
And somebody grabbed it through me out of my chair

943
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:54,460
So before you could eat you got a dance like Fred or the star

944
01:20:54,460 --> 01:21:00,460
You know I can dance, you know I can dance

945
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:04,460
You know I can dance, you know I can dance

946
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:25,460
I am a man of the road, a hobo

947
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,460
By name I don't seek entertainment

948
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:35,460
But if it's all the same to you then yes I will try my hand

949
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:41,460
If you raise hungry at me that I show you when I'm the star

950
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,460
I'll wait a minute

951
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,460
Yeah

952
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,460
Of course I can dance, of course I can dance

953
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:54,460
I'm sure I can dance, I'm sure I can dance

954
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:01,460
I'm a dance, I really hit the floor

955
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:06,460
I feel good, I'm a dance

956
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:19,460
I did a two-step quicks that manner

957
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:24,460
I'm the popper to the bass wall

958
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:28,460
Excuse me, Mike

959
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,460
It's a left-g står

960
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,460
I married down my taxi-do

961
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,460
Next week I come and back for mobile

962
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,460
I had a chance

963
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:42,460
Or I am także

964
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,460
Lord and my dance in the floor

965
01:22:45,460 --> 01:23:08,220
I need to stand as what I need, stand for the cowbell, a little clip there for when

966
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,700
I'm smoking, and then it would be just perfect, I've almost got everything I need here

967
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:20,620
in the Hilltop Watchtower's crackpot command studios, took for the naked chicks in the hot tub,

968
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:44,620
got I hate being alone on a Friday, when I think about you, think about love, I don't live without you and your love,

969
01:23:44,620 --> 01:24:09,620
if I had those golden drains of my yesterday, I would have left you in the heaven, but feel it, I am in on the way, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it,

970
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,620
feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel

01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:44,620
feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

973
01:25:44,620 --> 01:26:14,620
feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

974
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:44,620
feeling it, feel it, feel it, Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

975
01:26:44,620 --> 01:27:14,620
Do I make it look like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like it

976
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:40,660
It's like it's like that's like it's like it'll make a porcelain and it's like you're sorry.

977
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,660
I love this type.

978
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:52,160
Oh man, I wish I could participate in an alcoholic beverage right now, but I still

979
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:57,680
got a computer America coming up in about four hours from now, so I'll have to keep

980
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,680
me.

981
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:04,660
You know, me, I'm such a lightweight, a roll over immediately.

982
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:14,660
Now, bad company.

983
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,660
Going through the archives of stuff I have tagged for the Charlie.

984
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:22,220
Oh, by the way, a programming note for those of you who didn't know already, no agenda

985
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:29,320
2, 2, 2 will be broadcast tomorrow, tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. in the morning, seeing

986
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:34,840
his miss Mickey and I leave Saturday afternoon, and we have an extra what John would call

987
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:37,320
an evergreen show lined up for Thursday.

988
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:43,440
Should I not be able to connect with him from the Netherlands and Tiles, but I'm thinking

989
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,440
it'll work out.

990
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,000
I mean, internet is pretty much everywhere these days, so I shouldn't be too much for

991
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
problem.

992
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,440
So anyway, going through the archives, I find a ray on the chart, which we have not shared yet,

993
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,440
so let's roll out Ray.

994
01:28:53,440 --> 01:29:15,400
Hey, this week, the was the release of an English magazine, Inspire, which is something

995
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:21,520
like a club magazine for terrorists, made by an al-Qaeda big week from Yemen, and

996
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,760
our al-Avlaki.

997
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:29,560
The magazine focus on radical Muslims in Europe and North America, and it includes a manual

998
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,400
for making bombs at home.

999
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:37,800
On the magazine's hit list, art, the names of the Danish cartoonist, Kurt Vestigart,

1000
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:45,200
author Salman Rushdie, Ayyan Hirshi Ali, and the Dutch politician, Kurt Wilders.

1001
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:50,520
Kurt Wilders is the frontman of the Dutch Freedom Party, and was the big winner of the Dutch

1002
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:56,320
Military Elections held on June 9, 2010.

1003
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:01,640
He's threatened with debt by al-Qaeda after he announced his new big plans for the Western

1004
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,400
Modern World on Thursday.

1005
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:10,840
This week he announced that he's building an international umbrella organization for

1006
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:18,880
organizations and individuals, as the PVV, fight for freedom and against Islam.

1007
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:24,880
He strives to present the so-called international freedom aliens at the end of this year,

1008
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:30,160
together with sympathizers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, and

1009
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,160
France.

1010
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:38,200
Builders says that he's working with prominent persons on the Eva, but does not name names.

1011
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:44,680
The intention is that, at the end of this year, a presentation of the Eva website is launched.

1012
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:50,280
In the meantime, the Spanish government has expressed the Moroccan authorities its concern

1013
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:55,000
about the release of Christians from the North African country.

1014
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,120
Since March this year, Morocco expelled 130 Christians for alleged conversion drive.

1015
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:09,040
The newspaper L.I.E. reported that the Spanish ambassador has asked the Morocco Rabbit government

1016
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,400
for a clarification.

1017
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:18,120
Spain wants Morocco to respect the international obligations in the area for religious freedom.

1018
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:24,000
Also seven people from the Netherlands who gave shelter to orphans in Morocco are deported

1019
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,560
because they sometimes read from the Bible that told children about Jesus.

1020
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,120
Looking about freedom of religion, I got to call my friends from the Y.

1021
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:41,880
You know, the worldwide movement of more than 45 million members from under 24 federations

1022
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,560
affiliated through the world aliens of Y.M.C.A.S.

1023
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,360
Otherwise, the dust will never settle down.

1024
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,040
I really need some positive vibe now on the Charlie.

1025
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,360
The soundtrack to my life.

1026
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:59,360
Maybe something like, ah, a good soundtrack from your life.

1027
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:05,520
I.M.C.A. is a song by the village people, which became a hit in 1979.

1028
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,120
The song reached number one on the U.S. charge and reached number one in the UK around

1029
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:16,280
the same time, becoming the group's biggest hit ever.

1030
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:22,200
Taken at Vage Value, its lyrics extols the rituals of the young man's Christian association.

1031
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,200
Gonna wish y'all a very nice weekend.

1032
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
Bye bye now.

1033

1045
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:59,200
That old analogue, nothing sounds quite like it doesn't.

1046
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,200
Listen to it.

1047
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,200
Oh yeah.

1048
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,200
You never heard that part on the radio.

1049
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
That's for sure.

1050
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,200
Rod Stewart handbags in the glad rags.

1051
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,200
Sound the daily source code.

1052
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,200
And let me bring in a little bit of slapback bass from herby flowers.

1053
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,200
Who's that?

1054
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:17,200
He plays along with Lou Reed on walk on the wild side.

1055
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,200
Hi.

1056
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:31,200
Hollywood came from Miami at Bill A.

1057
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,200
Hitchhack to way across USA.

1058
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:42,200
Pluster eyebrows on the way, shaved her legs and then he was as she should says he'd be.

1059
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:45,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1060
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:49,200
Said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side.

1061
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,200
Candy came from out on the island.

1062
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,200
In the back room she was everybody's darling.

1063
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:11,200
But she never lost her head,

1064
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,200
even when she was given head, she says hey babe.

1065
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1066
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,200
Said hey babe, take a walk on the wild side.

1067
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:30,200
And the colored girls go, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, thingy a wirklich.

1068
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:55,200
Little Joe, never once gave it away.

1069
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:59,200
Everybody had to pay and pay.

1070
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,200
A hustle here and a hustle there.

1071
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,200
New York City is the place where they said he'd be.

1072
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1073
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:13,200
I said, hey, Joe, take a walk on the wild side.

1074
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:23,200
Oh Lord, hey, Joe, just give me.

1075
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:28,200
Look at the smoke.

1076
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:38,200
It's all gone, it's all gone, I came in.

1077
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:41,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1078
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:46,200
Baby, take a walk on the wild side, all right.

1079
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,200
Huh.

1080
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:58,200
Jackie is just speeding away.

1081
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:03,200
Thought she was Jim Dean for a day.

1082
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,200
Then I guess she had to crash.

1083
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,200
All the young would have helped that fish that said he'd be.

1084
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1085
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,200
Say hey honey.

1086
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,200
Take a walk on the wild side and the color girls say.

1087
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:41,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1088
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,200
Say hey honey.

1089
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1090
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,200
Say hey honey.

1091
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:51,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1092
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,200
Say hey honey.

1093
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1094
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,200
Say hey honey.

1095
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,200
Say hey honey.

1096
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,200
Say hey honey.

1097
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:08,200
Take a walk on the wild side.

1098
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:13,200
I would be remiss if I did not mention to you that this program is listener supported.

1099
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:16,200
And I appreciate it if you donate to the cause support the show.

1100
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,200
No agenda.

1101
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,200
You can go to no agenda show.com.

1102
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,200
Daily source code.com.

1103
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:25,200
Of course, devorac.org slash NA is where you can sign up for multiple ways to support.

1104
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,200
The stream, the show, the show as well.

1105
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:32,200
And tomorrow in the morning will be doing another no agenda show.

1106
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:37,200
And I think that once I get back and into the swing of things after I take my cheap holiday.

1107
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:41,200
And there's nothing cheaper than staying at a friend's house.

1108
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,200
Let me tell you.

1109
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
We'll be kicking it large.

1110
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:48,200
And hopefully ratcheting up some of the episodes of the Charlie.

1111
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,200
Although I have to say really all that pent up energy and bring it all into one day into one

1112
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,200
Fubar Friday or sometimes the snafu Saturday really does work.

1113
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
It's like a big release.

1114
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:01,200
It's like one big money shot.

1115
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:06,200
And boys, the money shot is just that.

1116
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:10,200
Okay.

1117
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,200
Time to turn up the speakers.

1118
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,200
Teer axe, bang it, gong it at home.

1119
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200
Let's do it.

1120

You do these feet down there.

1123
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:33,200
But just in the week, you got the tune to the hydra for you.

1124
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:38,200
You do these feet, you're my girl.

Get it all.

1133
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:01,200
When you're feeling nothing cold, you're going to hurt.

1134
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:03,200
Can't time it's going to heal.

1135
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:07,200

We can't dance with a walk, but it doesn't take a time to stand on the back of the other door

1159
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:55,200

A little mushy in here on this teenage wasteland

1194
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,200
How about you

1205
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:34,200
Don't cry

1206
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,200
Don't reach your eyes

1207
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:46,200

1299
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,800
And I think that we have let him suffer long enough.

1300

Comic strip.

1305
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:37,800
Come on in, CSB.

1306
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:39,800
Hello, Adam Inception Curry.

1307
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:43,800
Here is CSB, your CEO, correspondent.

1308
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:44,800
Yes.

1309
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:52,800
So, after long debate, CEO has finally decided what to do with genetically modified organisms,

1310
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:53,800
fought and planned.

1311
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:54,800
Go put it in the snacks.

1312
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,800
It's good to taste each country.

1313
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:02,800
We'll be able in CEO to decide whether they want to grow genetically modified stuff or not.

1314
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,800
Right.

1315
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:06,800
There will be no over all you love for that.

1316
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:12,800
So, for example, lovers of genetically engineering, like Czech Republic and Spain, will be

1317
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:13,800
extending the genetic ropes.

1318
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:19,800
But haters of genetically engineering could modify the food, like Australia or Italy,

1319
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,800
will be forbidding it.

1320
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,800
But there's one tiny question.

1321
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:29,800
What about the wings and animals that are carrying the genetically modified plants and seeds?

1322
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:30,800
Yeah, they're tasty.

1323
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,800
I think soon all food on this stupid planet called Earth will be genetically modified.

1324
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:41,800
Whether you want it or not, it's a manifest destiny.

1325
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,800
Sorry.

1326
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,800
Oh, yeah.

1327
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:48,800
I mean, what are you talking about CSB?

1328
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,800
This has already happened.

1329
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,800
There's nothing you eat that doesn't contain some genetically modified crap.

1330
01:58:55,800 --> 01:59:00,800
Yeah, it's nice, nice little tasty GM modified snacks courtesy of.

1331
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:04,800
Yeah.

1332
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,800
Back to lobster dices.

1333
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,800
And the mash-up.

1334
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,800
The blue me away when I heard it.

1335
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:15,800
Stone Temple pilot versus Miley Cyrus on the Charlie.

1336
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:30,800
You know I just stand.

1337
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,800
Yeah, what it is.

1338
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:34,800
That makes it take.

1339
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,800
But you wish it did.

1340
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,800
Yeah, always taking yes.

1341
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:38,800
What a rip.

1342
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:39,800
I say yes.

1343
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,800
It just moves out every time.

1344
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,800
It's the only do.

1345
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,800
What?

1346
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:49,800
I talked about when I was my friend just hanging out.

1347
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,800
Maybe about the insides, too.

1348
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,800
Oh, what to say?

1349
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:53,800
What to do?

1350
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:56,800
That way when you make the game, baby, you can never look.

1351
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,800
So, we're such a pity that I don't know that.

1352
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,800
I'm a pity real pity that I don't know that.

1353

So, we're such a pity that I don't know that.

1356
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:26,800
It was no.

1357
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:27,800
It was no.

1358
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:28,800
It was a deal.

1359
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,800
When I'm with my son.

1360
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:31,800
Now we do.

1361
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,800
Yeah, always taking yes.

1362
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,800
Mother, it was never gotten going.

1363
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:35,800
Yeah, it was a new year.

1364
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:36,800
No, my now.

1365
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,800
If you were my boy.

1366
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,800
So, it's happy to meet you.

1367
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,800
If I make the call.

1368
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,800

What I say is,

1386
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,800
It's come with a closer.

1387
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:06,800
And what I can tell you is, don't you?

1388
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:16,800

We're going to come on with.

1395
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,800
If you never let's say,

To watch your say, yes.

1397
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,800
Yeah, it works for me.

1398
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:55,800
Of course, we've got up to one guy to be able to make that kind of mess.

Oh, I was going to tell you about Big App Show.

1405
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,800
I don't think I mentioned this,

1406
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:18,800
but I've actually been working on something very cool.

1407
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:23,800
A friend of mine who actually was my agent in Hollywood 20 years ago.

1408
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,800
Super agent Lesher.

1409
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,800
He, he's a big fan of the app.

1410
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,800
Should we call me up tonight?

1411
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:30,800
I got an idea.

1412
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,800
He talks because I got an idea at him.

1413
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:33,800
Is it a really good idea?

1414
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:36,800
So, what's up, super agent?

1415
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,800
He says, well, I think I can get all kinds of celebrities to promote their apps.

1416
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,800
And they can do episodes for you.

1417
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,800
Oh, yeah.

1418
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:45,800
That's actually a pretty good idea.

1419
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:47,800
Guess who's coming in.

1420
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:51,800
After I get back from vacation to promote his app.

1421
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,800
Oh, yes.

1422
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,800
The man who some call God himself.

1423
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,800
To present an episode of the Big App Show.

1424
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,800
The one and only.

1425
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,800
David Hasselhoff.

1426
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:02,800
Oh, yes.

1427
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,800
The app man will be the hoff.

1428
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,800
I gotta tell you, I have been excited about things, but that kind of,

1429
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:09,800
just takes the gamut.

1430
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:14,800
Kind of close on the charting episode,

1431
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,800
eight, four days to football Friday.

1432
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,800
Mr. Jones.

1433
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,800
He's done a new episode down.

1434
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:25,800
He's done a this yellow hair rommet.

1435
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,800
He just strikes on the competition.

1436
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,800
We're black here.

1437
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,800
We make our dance music.

1438
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,800
He dances while his father plays.

1439
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:38,800
So, she's starting beautiful.

1440
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,800
And I want something beautiful.

1441
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:45,800
I don't show beautiful.

1442
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:50,800
So come here for some of his dancing tomorrow.

1443
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:54,800
Shout-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out-out.

1444
02:04:54,800 --> 02:05:00,800
One song there.

1445
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,800
Cure with me up.

1446
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:06,800
Show me some of his Spanish dance.

1447
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,800
He has me a bottle.

1448
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:09,800
Best of the Jones.

1449
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:24,800
Because I want to be someone who believes

1450
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:31,800
Yes, to show them me Tell each other

1451
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:35,800
It's every chance I'll be standing in the room

1452
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:39,800
It's just looking at you I'll know you should look at me

1453
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:43,800
Smiling in the bright light

1454
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,800
Come out through hysteria

1455

And we're everybody in love you

You could never be lonely

1457
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:56,800
While I'm awake in my picture

1458
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:00,800
Bring myself through red black and red

1459
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:05,800
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful

1460
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:09,800
Every now and then my favorite colors

1461
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:14,800
I feel so symbolic yesterday

1462
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,800
And my new Picasso

1463
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,800
Now I'm by myself for a break

1464
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:23,800
It's all I'm playing in this country

1465
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,800
Look at you in the future

1466
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,800
Now we're standing in the room

1467
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:32,800
It's just looking at you

1468
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,800
I'll know you should look at me

1469
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:37,800
Smiling in the bright light

1470
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,800
Come out through hysteria

1471
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:44,800
And we're everybody in love me

1472
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:49,800
I'll never be lonely

1473
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:52,800
I'll never be lonely

1474
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,800
I'll never be lonely

1475
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:00,800
I'll never be alone

1476
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:04,800
I'll never be alone

1477
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,800
And everybody won't pass this count

1478
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,800
I'll never be fit, fit stars, ever

1479
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,800
We got different reasons for that

1480
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,800
Leaving me

1481
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,800
Because I'm so free, man, anything

1482
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,800
And I just want to be someone

1483
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:28,800
Jumping in, jumping in, jumping in

1484
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:31,800
Yes, that you'll let me

1485
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:34,800
I'm storming out for your body

1486
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,800
Now it's just looking at you

1487
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:37,800
I'll never be lonely

1488
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:39,800
She's a fool of you

1489
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,800
Man, it's got to be somebody

1490
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:44,800
Me, I'll be by you

1491
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:46,800
Mr. Joe Bush, he was someone

1492
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,800
Just to let him off

1493
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,800
He went in, everybody

1494
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:51,800
Love you

1495
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:52,800
I saw you

1496
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,800
Just about what gives you

1497
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:56,800
To me

1498
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,800
Mr. Joe

1499
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,800
Damn it

1500
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
I knew I'd score a big with that news

1501
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,800
About the half on the big app show

1502
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,800
If you don't know what the big app show is

1503
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,800
If you've got an iPhone or iPad

1504
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,800
You can go to

1505
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:14,800
Bigappshow.com or search for it in the app store

1506
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,800
I might as well spill the beans

1507
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,800
On a couple other silver tays

1508
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,800
You're scheduled to appear in their own app

1509
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,800
So any Duke, poker player, extraordinaire

1510
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:28,800
And I think on the weekend of the 13th

1511
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,800
One of the wrestlers of the WWE

1512
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:33,800
Oh yeah, I don't mess around man

1513
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,800
When I sit out to make the

1514
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,800
The MTV of apps, I mean it

1515
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:41,800
Now I've got to figure out how to make some money with it

1516
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:43,800
Love a lot of fun at the meantime

1517
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,800
My dad's boys, please be

1518
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:47,800
From the brains going to the balls

1519
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,800
You know what happens, don't you?

1520
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:51,800
Ha ha ha

1521
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,800
Me and the boys went out for a ride

1522
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,800
Typical attitude

1523
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:07,800
We are all tied

1524
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:13,800
Come in and out on the 7th level

1525
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:18,800
Oh, roll, roll, roll, roll

1526

Turn it up, turn it around

1528
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:29,800
If you've got me, it's about my own

1529
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,800
But it's just in my mind

1530
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:35,800
Nothing can stop us, nothing at all

1531
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,800
Find a try, the ball, roll

1532
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,800
I see all the 9th level

02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:43,800

You know, you're just another joke

Turn it up, turn it around

1543
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:11,800
You get the best thing out on the ground

1544
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:15,800
You get the ball, roll

1545
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:19,800
Nothing can stop us, nothing at all

1546
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,800
Find a try, the ball, roll

1547
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,800

In the morning.

1577
02:15:53,800 --> 02:16:23,800
Even though one's all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,

1579
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:56,300
Well, jam, even flow off the trolley.

1580
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:58,800
Perfect, who are funny too?

1581
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,800
Oh, that would be fun.

1582
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:01,800
That would be fun.

1583
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:04,800
I'm sorry, you can tell me Adam and Curry are coming.

1584
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:08,800
Get him in for the football we'll be doing in two weeks time.

1585
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:12,800
I can't stay with you for the typical...

1586
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:13,800
What?

1587
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:17,800
I can't stay with you for the typical three hours that I'd like to do

1588
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:20,800
because I just got some stuff to do before.

1589
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:23,800
These seven-to-all computer-american shows.

1590
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:24,800
Then they got a trap.

1591
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:25,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1592
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:26,800
Come on, man.

1593
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:27,800
About the house room, blue.

1594
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:28,800
No.

1595
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,800
Perfect for no agenda for tomorrow morning.

1596
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,800
Come home one Friday.

1597
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,800
Had a ton of land, lady, I'd have lost my job.

1598
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:35,800
Oh, right.

1599
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:36,800
It's George Sturgut.

1600
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:37,800
Yeah.

1601
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:39,800
She said that to come front me.

1602
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:41,800
Long as I get my money next Friday.

1603
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:43,800
It should get your blood boiling.

1604
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:45,800
Now that it's Friday, come out and get the rent.

1605
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:46,800
And I put the aura away.

1606
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:47,800
Thank you, boss.

1607
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:54,800
So I go through the lane, lady.

1608
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:59,800
I think you'll let me slide.

1609
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:04,800
I have to rent for it on my other next day.

1610
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:08,800
I don't know.

1611
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:11,800
So, so let me slide it on, you know, people.

1612
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:16,800
I know it's what I come home in the evening.

1613
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:19,800
She got nothing nice to say to me.

1614
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:22,800
But for five years, she was so nice.

1615
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:26,800
No, what you will love her, David.

1616
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:29,800
I come home one particular evening.

1617
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:32,800
The lady said you got the rent money yet.

1618
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:34,800
I said, no.

1619
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,800
Can't find no job.

1620
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:38,800
They've only got no money to pay the rent.

1621
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:45,800
She said that, I don't believe you're trying to find no job.

1622
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:48,800
Said I knew today was standing on a corner.

1623
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:50,800
They never get to post.

1624
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:53,800
I said, but I'm tired.

1625
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:55,800
I've been walking on day.

1626
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:58,800
She said, that don't be fun, me.

1627
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,800
Long as I get my money next Friday.

1628
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:04,800
Now I try to come out and never rent.

1629
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:07,800
And I put the aura away.

1630
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:13,800
So I go down the streets.

1631
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:17,800
And I'm a good friend, Stiles.

1632
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:20,800
As I look, man.

1633
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:22,800
I'm out of those, you know.

1634
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:28,800
And I'll stay with you, maybe a couple days.

1635
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:31,800
You said, oh, let me kill her as my wife.

1636
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:34,800
To come out of the house, I can see this face.

1637
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,800
I know it was no.

1638
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,800
Said, I don't know, man.

1639
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:40,800
She got a money, no.

1640
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:42,800
I said, I know.

1641
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:44,800
Everybody's funny.

1642
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:47,800
Now you put it too.

1643
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,800
So I go back home, man.

1644
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,800
I'll tell the little lady.

1645
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:53,800
I got a job.

1646
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:55,800
I'm gonna pay the rent.

1647
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:56,800
She said, yeah.

1648
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:59,800
I said, oh yeah.

1649
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:01,800
And then she was so nice.

1650
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:16,800
So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go.

1651
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:19,800
I'll slip on out the back door.

1652
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:22,800
Down the streets, I go.

1653
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:27,800
She are hollowing about the front rent.

1654
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:30,800
She'll be lucky getting her back rent.

1655
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:34,800
She ain't gonna get another.

1656
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:38,800
So I stop in a local bar, you know, people.

1657
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,800
I'm going to the bar.

1658
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:41,800
I'll rent my code.

1659
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,800
I'll call the bartender.

1660
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,800
So look, man.

1661
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,800
Come down here.

1662
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:48,800
You got down there.

1663
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,800
So what you want?

1664
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:53,800
The one verb and the one sky.

1665
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:56,800
The one here.

1666
02:20:57,800 --> 02:21:01,800
When I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when.

1667
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,800
I've been drinking bourbon whiskey.

1668
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,800
I've got you and Jim.

1669
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:06,800
Gonna get high man.

1670
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,800
I'm gonna get a lose.

1671
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:11,800
Need me a triple shot of attitude.

1672
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:13,800
I'm gonna get drunk.

1673
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:15,800
I don't fear.

1674
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:17,800
I want one verb and the one sky.

1675
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:21,800
I need one verb and the one sky.

1676
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:24,800
One fear.

1677
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:34,800
But I'm sitting now.

1678
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,800
At the bar.

1679
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:37,800
I'm being drunk.

1680
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:43,800
I'm feeling mellow.

1681
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:45,800
I'm taking bourbon.

1682
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:47,800
I'm taking a stat.

1683
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:48,800
I'm taking beer.

1684
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:53,800
I'm going down a bar.

02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:57,800
So look, man.

You

1706
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:14,020
Ned

1707
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:20,940
Sit down

1708
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:25,240
Slowly

1709
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:27,240
I'm playing a high

1710
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,240
You know when your mouth is getting dry

1711
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,240
You're playing a high

1712
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:33,240
Look down the bar

1713
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:35,240
I'll see you in my butt tonight

1714
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:37,240
I'll sell you a man

1715
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:39,240
Come down here

1716
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,240
You got down there

1717
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:42,240
So it's my dish time

1718
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,240
I'll sell you a man

1719
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,240
I would sign this

1720
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:47,240
You sit the clock on the wall

1721
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:48,240
It's futile

1722
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,240
I lay as close

1723
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:55,240
About the hall

1724
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,240
So it's what you need

1725
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:03,240
One verb and one shot

1726
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:05,240
One beer

1727
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:11,240
I ain't seen my favorite since the lie on a week

1728
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:13,240
Gotta get drunk, man

1729
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:14,240
So I can't even speak

1730
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:17,240
Gonna get high, man

1731
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:18,240
Listen to me

1732
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:20,240
One drinking and up jacket

1733
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:22,240
Better making free

1734
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:25,240
Gonna get drunk, I'm gonna make it real clear

1735
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:27,240
I'll run, run, burn, run

1736
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:29,240
You've got to one beer

1737
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:30,240
One beer, one beer

1738
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:33,240
One fat beer

1739
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:36,240
I know a lot of people listen to the show

1740
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:37,240
All working out on the treadmill

1741
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:39,240
And I think that is exactly the type of song

1742
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:41,240
That gives you the rhythm

1743
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:42,240
The role that you need

1744
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:44,240
When you're trying to drop a few pounds

1745
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:46,240
Oh by the way

1746
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,240
My daughter was here

1747
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:49,240
And she said that

1748
02:25:49,240 --> 02:25:50,240
Yes, I do qualify

So you'll get news on that

Door third good, one bourbon

One scotch, one beer on the Charlie's seven minutes and 42 seconds of goodness now on

Oh yeah

1807
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:29,240
I can't remember anything

1808
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:33,240
Can't tell if this is true or clear

1809
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:36,240
Deep down inside, I'll feel the screen

1810
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:39,240
This terrible silence stopped in May

1811
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:43,240
Now that the war is through with me

1812
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:46,240
I'm waking up again, I'll see

1813
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:50,240
That there's not much left in me

1814
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:53,240
Nothing is real but paid it now

1815
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:57,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1816
02:27:57,240 --> 02:28:02,240
Oh please God wait me

1817
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:18,240
Back in the womb it's much to real

1818
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:21,240
And it's not that I must feel

1819
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:25,240
But can't look forward to it, dear

1820
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:28,240
Look to the time when I'll live

1821
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:31,240
Better to do this thing to me

1822
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:34,240
Just like a war time now

1823
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:35,240
Oh dear

1824
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:38,240
Tight to the shins and make me be

1825
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:41,240
Cut this life apart from me

1826
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:46,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1827
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:50,240
Oh please God wait me

1828
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:19,240
Now the world is gone

1829
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:21,240
I'm just one

1830
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,240
Oh, God help me

1831
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:28,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1832
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:33,240
Oh please God help me

1833
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:46,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1834
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:51,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1835
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:56,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1836
02:29:56,240 --> 02:30:01,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1837
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:05,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1838
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:08,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1839
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:22,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1840
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:26,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1841
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:35,240
Oh, my breath is how it is, oh dear

1842
02:30:35,240 --> 02:31:05,240
In visiting me, all I see, absolutely all I can do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do, I can not do

1847
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:11,160
forget my very first Metallica experience on the North Pole and Tukti-Yuk-Tuk-North

1848
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:19,720
West Territories with the Molson Ice Polar Beach Challenge, where we actually cybercasted

1849
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:26,480
live from the North Pole, we had Veruca Salt, whole, Courtney Love completely smashed,

1850
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:32,680
diving into the crowd and Metallica. 500 prize winners, that was it, it was the most outrageous

1851
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:39,160
experience I've ever had when it comes to rock and now I want you all to put your hands

1852
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:46,840
on your iPhone, your smartphone, your blackberry, your android, I want you to squeeze it, I want

1853
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:51,560
you to lift your eyes up to the hills and I want you to pray to the gods of rock to come

1854
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:58,560
down and give us the stairway to heaven.

1855
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:51,520
There's a lady who shone, all it glitters is gold,

1856
02:34:51,520 --> 02:35:03,520
and she's buying the stairway to heaven, when she gets there she knows, you can start our

1857
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:18,520
close with the word she can get what she can.

1858
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:30,840
And she's buying the stairway to heaven, there's a sign on the wall, but she wants to wish you

1859
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:43,160
what, because you know sometimes words help me in the dream by the road, there's a song

1860
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:58,160
bird who sings sometimes all of words help me in the dream.

there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone,

1885
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:41,160
there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone,

1886

there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone,

1887
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:17,160
there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone,

1888
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:32,160
there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone,

1894
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:38,160
there's a lady who shone, there's a lady who shone,

1895
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:54,160
Sing us the song, you're the piano band, sing us the song tonight

1896
02:45:54,160 --> 02:46:02,160
Well we're out in the mood for a melody, and you've got us feeling alright

1897
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:10,160
Everybody was wasted, get ready to sing along

1898
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:24,160
Chatteru, it's a little crowd for a sad day, and the bad at your lips being smile

1899
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:34,160
Because he knows that it's me, they've been coming to see, to forget about life

1900
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:42,160
And the piano sounds like a tunnel, and the microphone smells like a beer

1901
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:50,160
And they sit at the bar, and put bread in my jar and say, man, what are you doing here?

1902
02:46:50,160 --> 02:47:18,160
We're out in the mood for a melody, and you've got us feeling alright

1903
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:32,160
Absolutely, the perfect song to get wasted by, and you know me, Mr. Lightweight, one rolling rock, we'll do it to me

1904
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:38,160
How did we almost get to three hours again? I was supposed to cut out in here early, this is like nuts

1905
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:46,160
I want to thank Ray for sending this one into me, I have not played this song in the radio in New Years

1906
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:54,160
But nuts about it when I was in high school, couldn't help singing it, even though the lyrics kind of weird when you're a guy, love unlimited

1907
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:58,160
I'm so glad that I'm a woman

1908
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:02,160
It's nice, you know, in the morning when you wake up

1909
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:08,160
As you comb your hair and put on your makeup, it's too lyrical, you know what I mean

1910
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:42,160
Just use the chocolate cake, and you can make it even way

1911
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:50,160
I'm so glad that I'm a woman, and no one will trade, I'm the one that made it all

1912
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:58,160
You're the lifeline of mankind, and now it's a time for me

Love and limited I'm so glad I'm a woman

1939
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,160

And I've got to see the lyrics

1969
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:57,360
Sears are surrounded. You're a pound. You're a pound. You're a pound. You're a pound.

1970
02:54:57,360 --> 02:55:00,360

1971
02:55:00,360 --> 02:55:02,360

02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:53,360
You're a pound. You're a pound. You're a pound. You're a pound. You're a pound.

1979
02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:59,360
You still watch it, I've been told, let's say you're the story

1980
02:55:59,360 --> 02:56:03,360
You can feel a ship or a ride

1981
02:56:03,360 --> 02:56:07,360
Just some, it's for you, Jim Lauren

1982
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:15,360
But here I'm always told, true love was mine

1983
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:22,360
But there's hope, there's hope, there's hope, there's hope, there's hope

1984
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:30,360
And I, when the bars close down, ran into walks through a sighting town

1985
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:36,360
Love's a man, it's not a run, she's still getting here in the same

1986
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:41,360
She has a ship right up there, you'll find your ride

1987
02:56:41,360 --> 02:56:48,360
What a good way, you and me, set your mind, my love, my love, my lady

1988
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:55,360
Is the same, it is, you and me, you and my girl

1989
02:56:55,360 --> 02:56:58,360
What a good way, you and me, you and me

1990
02:56:58,360 --> 02:57:02,360
Looking glass, how many times I've said that?

1991
02:57:02,360 --> 02:57:07,360
Looking glass, brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good way if you would be

1992
02:57:07,360 --> 02:57:13,360
Okay, boy, wait a minute, let me just check you

1993
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:16,360
A little trickle of blood coming out of my ear from earlier when we played

1994
02:57:16,360 --> 02:57:18,360
Some of the harder stuff

1995
02:57:18,360 --> 02:57:22,360
So it looks like we just about made three hours after all, I'm not quite sure how we do it

1996
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:25,360
But I can't stop, I'm just enjoying it so much

1997
02:57:25,360 --> 02:57:27,360

And support the show, it'll be much more important now than ever before

2002
02:57:43,360 --> 02:57:47,360
As you can imagine, if you've been listening throughout the entire program

2003
02:57:47,360 --> 02:57:51,360
Looks like David source code along with no agenda will be highlighted on iTunes

2004
02:57:51,360 --> 02:57:55,360
In the next coming weeks, the guys called in and said that they were, there's a new team over there

This folks over there putting together a playlist with iTunes, links of all the songs

02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:25,360
Played on these long extended Fubar Friday Charles

2012
02:58:25,360 --> 02:58:29,360
So that does wrap up episode 84840 of the Daily Source Code

2013
02:58:29,360 --> 02:58:34,360
The I'm Free Fubar Edition was produced with the help of hundreds of chuckleheads worldwide

2014
02:58:34,360 --> 02:58:37,360
Rebirthing the art of radio globally

2015
02:58:37,360 --> 02:58:43,360
May I live to be 100, each of you to be 100 in a day, so I never have to see my friends pass away

2016
02:58:43,360 --> 02:58:46,360
Until next time, live your life with passion

2017
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:49,360
And as long as it lasts, enjoy your freedom

2018
02:58:55,360 --> 02:59:10,360
There are places I remember for my life

2019
02:59:10,360 --> 02:59:15,360
Though some have changed, some forever

2020
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:22,360
Not for better, some have gone

2021
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:28,360
And some remain, all these places

2022
02:59:28,360 --> 02:59:34,360
Had a moment with lovers and friends

2023
02:59:34,360 --> 02:59:38,360
I still can recall

2024
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:44,360
Some are dead, and some are living

2025
02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:51,360
In my life, I will love them all

2026
02:59:56,360 --> 03:00:02,360
But above these friends and lovers

2027
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:08,360
There is no nobody that can lose with you

2028
03:00:08,360 --> 03:00:14,360
I and these memories, blues and meaning

2029
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:18,360
When I think of love

2030
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:23,360
As something new, I know I know

2031
03:00:23,360 --> 03:00:30,360
I'm never as affection for people and things

2032
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:36,360
And before I know I love and stuff

2033
03:00:36,360 --> 03:00:42,360
And take a welcome in my heart

2034
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:46,360
I love you more

2035
03:01:00,360 --> 03:01:17,360
I know I'm never as affection for people and things

2036
03:01:17,360 --> 03:01:22,360
And before I know I know

2037
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:26,360
I have to stop and think about them

2038
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:34,360
In my life, I will love you more

2039
03:01:37,360 --> 03:01:48,360
In my life, I will love you more

2040
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:59,360
In my life, I will love you more
