Delta Shara Charley 824

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're 16 minutes and 7 minutes and showing 5 lines of time

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The 21st century of radio starts here

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We are in a freaking preview of life

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know it's gonna strike our podcast

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's Adam Curry

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
See you in the next one, little friend

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Adam Curry, I'm living in source code

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's go, the moment is day nine

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We go through a time one

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Keep on this and that fine

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's keep on this

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We're finally in the back seat

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're better in the beginning

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're facing the back seat

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We're facing the back seat

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're facing the back seat

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're facing the back seat

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm moved

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's go, let's go

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When they move

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't know

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm already a bit ready to go

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The moment is day nine

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We go through a time one

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We keep on this and that fine

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We're facing the back seat

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We're facing the back seat

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're facing the back seat

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're facing the back seat

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're facing the back seat

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's no shame in the back a little

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
One thing I wanna know

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All friends of red cat

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All living this day nine

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You go through the top one

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And if you can listen to them

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We're gonna speak for everybody

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because the pilot is in the back seat

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The general is in need

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But they said the back seat

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're gonna speak for them

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I-O!

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go!

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I-O!

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go!

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I-O!

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go!

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go!

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a fire flower

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it's the belly source code

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000

Oh yeah! You want free college

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Muscaditch

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
More kids in the school

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Whatever you like

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You have come to the right place

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why?

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll tell you why

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Who can take your money

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Who can take your money

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who can take your money

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Who can take your money

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Who can take your money

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Who can take your money

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who can take your money

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's a bug

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who can take your money

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Who can take your money

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who can take your money

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Who can take your money

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Who can take your money

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Who can take your money

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All the fears, the government

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, the government can't

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And the government can't because I mix it up

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We'll rise and make it all taste good

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The government takes everything we make

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To pay for all of their solutions

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hell, care, climate change for the show

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The role will wait the constant to show

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And who can give a bailout

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tell us to behave

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And make the founding fathers roll over in the grave

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The government

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, the government can't

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And the government can't because I mix it up

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We'll rise and make it all taste good

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The government takes everything we make

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
To pay for all of their solutions

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Their economics are fiction

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Soon we'll have to eat our dishes

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, who can be a failure

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And so many ways

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And instead of getting fired

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, we'll give ourselves a raise

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The government

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, the government can't

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The government can't

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And the government can't go

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They make it all taste good

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And your uncle Sam can't

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because if he exists it will

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
as it makes it all taste good

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And a field so good

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because the government says I should

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, yeah

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that guy awesome or what?

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,080
10 Hawkins, the government can rollin' out on the Friday for you, which is

122
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,020

128
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,280
What can I say, try to find your bros, I am governor, cherry brown, I are a smile that

129
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:06,080
never frowns, so I will keep a rest, I can't, I will keep a rest, I can't, I will keep a rest, I will

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:15,280
sleep the way, I will be clearer one day, I will not mend all of you in the middle

131
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:45,280
in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in

133
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:31,720
That was one of those

134
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Now it's night to be dated for

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I can not act in your front door

136
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,720
It's the sway, denim, secret police

137
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
They have come for your uncooled names

138
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm quite a thin dude in town

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,720
You're the nicest, I'm just a man

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Don't you worry, it's me, it's short

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Boy, I'm trying, it's a pretty girl

142
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm a gay boy

143
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm so gay, I'm so gay, I'm so gay

144
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Don't you worry, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

145
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm a gay boy

146
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I'm a boy, now, I'm a realist

147
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm a boy, now, I'm a realist

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I'm a boy, now, I'm a boy

149
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm a funny, a thing I just read in the chat room

150
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
This is of course being the deaf candidates

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Who's thought in my lifetime

152
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
The actually would it kind of all be dead

153
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Because the kind of fun you're brought to some

154
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Daily source code eight twenty-four

155
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
It is the full bar Friday

156
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
And why would we do one more?

157
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
One more before we break it down and talk a little bit

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Just one more to get into the mood

159
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Ever since I played this track

160
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Or these guys in the previous Charlie

161
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I've just been going nuts about all of their stuff

162
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
They got a great album

163
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
It's rock sugar

164
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Pray it for a sweet weekend

165
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Once upon a time

166
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Once upon a time

167
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Once upon a time

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Once upon a time

169
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Once upon a time

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Once upon a time

171
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Once upon a time

172
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Once upon a time

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Once upon a time

174
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Once upon a time

175
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Once upon a time

176
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Once upon a time

177
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Once upon a time

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Once upon a time

179
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Once upon a time

180
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Once upon a time

181
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Once upon a time

182
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Once upon a time

183
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Once upon a time

184
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Once upon a time

185
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Once upon a time

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Once upon a time

187
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Once upon a time

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Once upon a time

189
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Once upon a time

190
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Once upon a time

191
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Once upon a time

192
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Once upon a time

193
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Everybody wants a new way

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Everybody's got a way of stopping

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Everybody needs a strategy

196
00:10:44,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Everybody wants a new way of stopping

197
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,120
I can't see the fear of you

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Everyone wants you, don't come without me

199
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Everyone's over here, you're all alone

200
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,520
Everyone's with you, you're all alone

201
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,320
When it comes to me, don't make it around

202
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,580
You're the one who made all that

203
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,660
You're the one who made all that

204
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,120
You're the one who made all you

205
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,420
All right, gotta be honest with you, this is uh

206
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,000
Did you tell me, do not have the CD yet

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,040
for YouTube, but it just sucks too much

208
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,840
to even for me to listen to it.

209
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,000
Damn.

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
Ah, that wasn't exactly what I was expecting.

211
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,240
Well, I can't play anymore Rock sugar

212
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,080
until I get the CD.

213
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,280
It's, I even tried turning off the compressors, everything.

214
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,800
It just would not work.

215
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
So yeah, we'll just win that one down.

216
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,960
All right, I think that we get the idea.

217
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,240
We're all kind of mashed out and we're ready for,

218
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,760
ah, for a full source code, let me tell ya.

219
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,200
A lot of interesting things going on.

220
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,560
The number one would have to be based upon the comeback

221
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,840
of the Charlie episode 821, one of the gossip magazines

222
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:48,320
in the Netherlands did a full, an unbelievable transcript

223
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
of the show.

224
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
Now, you recall I talked about my mom

225
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,920
and a spiritual experience I had.

226
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Well, ah, the way that turned up on the front page

227
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,720
of this rag was, dead mother tells Adam to leave Patricia.

228
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,040
And let me tell ya, if you listen to the show

229
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,160
and I actually contemplated pulling clips from it

230
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
so you could hear it.

231
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,920
I couldn't have said anything more opposite of that.

232
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,080
And then there was even a little inset that actually came

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,680
back to me in a weird way.

234
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,400
You know, I think I made an off-handed joke

235
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
about Christina.

236
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
And that came back as Adam says,

237
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,680
Christina only calls me when she needs money.

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,600
It's just unbelievable what these guys will do.

239
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,480
Now, of course, a contact with the ex is not that great.

240
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,120
So that created a little bit of friction,

241
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,880
ah, which is completely unnecessary.

242
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,600
But you know what?

243
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,880
And I had a long chat with Ms. Mickey about it.

244
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,680
It's like, this is what I do.

245
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
This is what the source code is.

246
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
This is what I've always done.

247
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,320
And I'm not gonna let it a couple of weenies

248
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,160
in Gitmo Lowlands with a circulation of 50,000.

249
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,280
Maybe they have more.

250
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,120
It doesn't matter.

251
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm not gonna let him stop me from talking about,

252
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,200
you know, sharing stuff amongst friends

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,640
as we're doing here.

254
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
And let's face it.

255
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,080
You know, the charcoal is coming back

256
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,360
and it'll take a while to build up the audience.

257
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,640
Although I will say that based upon

258
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,040
just everyone's iTunes reactivating,

259
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,240
it kind of worked.

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
You know, it was a nice little surge there.

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,440
It was nice to see the numbers pick up.

262
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,920
Now, let me just say something about this rag.

263
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,280
You know, obviously,

264
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,920
the media has made, and the Netherlands has made a nice little,

265
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,920
amount of money off of, you know, my personal situation.

266
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,200
And I have another example that I was thinking about

267
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,040
about how Nate, and you could say that it's intended,

268
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,400
and maybe it even is, and I'll take it down

269
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,000
that rabbit hole if you don't mind.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,720
I was thinking about Tiger Woods.

271
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,200
And first of all, your Tiger Woods is a multi-billion dollar

272
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,760
franchise, multi-billion, I think he himself has made

273
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
over a billion dollars, no kidding,

274
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,720
like really a billion dollars in cash

275
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
throughout his career, which has been quite long at this point.

276
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,160
And so you kind of think that with all of that money

277
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,680
writing on it, if he made a billion, then several,

278
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,960
several more billions were made by, and TV licensing

279
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,880
deals for broadcast and sponsorships.

280
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,640
And I want to tell you kind of how that works

281
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,400
and what I think happened here, because, you know,

282
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,640
we don't really get to talk about this on no agenda,

283
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,200
and for good reason, because it's really seen

284
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,680
as the real news, you know, the distraction,

285
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,280
but there's something really big going on here,

286
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,560
when you look at an athlete who,

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,960
he didn't really bring back golf.

288
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,000
In fact, the numbers on golf aren't up all that much,

289
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,680
but people were watching golf for Tiger Woods.

290
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,080
Broadcast numbers, and I did a little bit of research

291
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,320
on this, broadcast numbers were double,

292
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,360
any golf tournament if Tiger Woods would play,

293
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,560
double if not triple the amount of viewers,

294
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,760
because you know, the guy is like beautiful to watch.

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,040
And it's emotional, and it's a story behind it,

296
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
it's really fantastic.

297
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,960
But there's a real problem going on in the golf sector,

298
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,480
because where's all this money made?

299
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,240
It's made from corporate sponsorships,

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,280
and who are the main sponsors of golf?

301
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,480
Well, you know, that's pretty easy

302
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,320
besides some obvious luxury goods.

303
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,040
It really the financial industry.

304
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,040
And how does it work, you know, you got your clients,

305
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,360
and it's just like Formula One,

306
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,200
which is also pretty much down the tubes.

307
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,080
Now, I think Richard Branson is trying to being a bring it back.

308
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,400
But you know, when you're swimming in money

309
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,160
and you're in the financial service sector,

310
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,760
no, you're going to take the company plane,

311
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,120
you're going to take your big whales,

312
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,080
your big clients, you're going to fly them down,

313
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,520
you're going to have a good time, watch Tiger Woods,

314
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,440
the phenomenon, and so tons of money

315
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,400
was flowing in from financial services,

316
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,080
which, of course, really can't,

317
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
well, they might be able to afford it,

318
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,000
but they can't do this stuff anymore,

319
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,840
because their shareholders would revolt,

320
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,320
and that's actually already happened a couple of times.

321
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,120
So they're pulling money out.

322
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,440
And the way these television contracts work

323
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,560
is let's say there's a $10 million title sponsorship

324
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,320
for one of these, and I know how this works.

325
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,080
So I'm giving you the really insight.

326
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,840
Tell me, and that's pretty much a standard title sponsorship,

327
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,120
$10 million, probably four of that will go

328
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,280
to the television contract, let's say CBS.

329
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,280
And then another, oh, let me think,

330
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,600
you know, the person who wins a tournament

331
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,040
may get 20% of what's left, so of the six million,

332
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,080
you know, maybe one and a half or something like that,

333
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,200
or a million dollars, and by the way,

334
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,320
the rest of the tour of the half that at least thing,

335
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
the top half will all make some money.

336
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,880
So there's lots of money flowing around there.

337
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,040
So that money is now edging out,

338
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,200
and there's just no money to go into the television contracts.

339
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
And in fact, some contracts,

340
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,480
people might have been very happy with this whole Tiger Woods thing

341
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,040
and may have not been too sorry to see this come out,

342
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,320
because, oh, now we can cancel our contract.

343
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,200
And believe me, with a multi-billion dollar franchise

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,200
like Tiger Woods, there's no way people didn't know about this.

345
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,320
I mean, the guy wasn't hanging out with these women

346
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,440
without anyone else to know.

347
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,960
And let's say, ludicrous to think that.

348
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,280
So what to do if you're a media company,

349
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
any type of media company,

350
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,800
and you want to still make money off a Tiger Woods,

351
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,640
but you know that the money that he was good for

352
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,360
just isn't coming in because these big contracts

353
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,520
are all ebbing away.

354
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,400
Well, you might as well have a scandal

355
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,280
because then you can make money off of the guy

356
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
for years without paying a dime.

357
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,840
That's exactly what went on here.

358
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,560
It's exactly what happened.

359
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,480
By the same token, Michael Jackson,

360
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
worth more dead than alive.

361
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,240
So if they didn't actually kill him,

362
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
if they didn't actually expose Tiger Woods on purpose,

363
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,200
they certainly are complicit in the whole story.

364
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,800
And I'm just noticing some of this happening myself,

365
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,600
how they'll make money off of anybody

366
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
and anything without shame.

367
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,720
And that's okay.

368
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Ooh, I don't even think about you, no more.

369
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,680
Well, maybe you think you broke my heart.

370
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm gonna let you know of you.

371
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,120
But take a lot more hurt than what you got

372
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,520
to break this boy into.

373
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,720
Plenty of women in this world

374
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,920
and I'll find love a new deer.

375
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,400
So don't you trouble your girl, the girls.

376
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm not thinking about you.

377
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,680
Just stop, breathe, tending.

378
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm cold in my life waiting by the phone.

379
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,800
Hope in my car to say that you're sobbing.

380
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,920
Baby, don't be a fool.

381
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,880
You'll never, that fool.

382
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,720
I won't cry, no dear in my eye.

383
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,040
I won't choose a close-up action to give you

384
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,480
no sadness, action, I got no despair.

385
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,680
I don't even care.

386
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,840
So go out and find another to take a loving

387
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,200
y'all love it if you dare.

388
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,840
I don't even think about you, no more.

389
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,920
I should have known no one from my start

390
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,080
that you'd be the other dealin.

391
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
When we ordered in that restaurant,

392
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
and you ain't my new two.

393
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,200
But I'm gonna fall see your appetites.

394
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,040
Go on beyond the menu.

395
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,600
Holdin' my best friend in his new bed.

396
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,680
You're all the best to you too.

397
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,000
So stop, breathe, tending.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm cold in my life waiting by the phone.

399
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Hope in my car to say that you're sobbing.

400
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
Baby, don't be a fool.

401
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,400
You'll never, ever, that fool.

402
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,160
I won't cry, no dear in my eye.

403
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,520
I won't choose a close-up action to give you

404
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
no sadness, action, I got no despair.

405
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
I don't even care.

406
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,280
So go out and find another to take a loving

407
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,520
and you're loving it if you dare.

408
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Oh, cry.

409
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh, cry.

410
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Oh, cry.

411
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, cry.

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No sadness, action, I got no despair.

413
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Don't even care.

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
So go out and find another to take a loving

415
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
and you're loving it if you dare.

416
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,520
Oh, cry.

417
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
Oh, cry.

418
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,520
Oh, cry.

419
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,480
Oh, cry.

420
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,520
Oh, cry.

421
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,320
Oh, cry.

422
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,520
Oh, cry.

423
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,320
Oh, cry.

424
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,960
Oh, cry.

425
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,520
Oh, cry.

426
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,320
Oh, cry.

427
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,720
Oh, cry.

428
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
So the charcoal heads who have been run

429
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
for while recognizing Pete Hopkins.

430
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
I won't cry.

431
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,360
He had his, of course, God's say for dear friend Pete.

432
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,960
Good to have him back on the Charlie.

433
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,520
Of course, these days, he's a number one on whipseneb.com.

434
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
And I was looking at a way, I guess.

435
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,000
And I got to tell you, I'm really excited about being out here,

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,120
because there's a lot of people I know that I'm just looking

437
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,240
forward to reconnecting with.

438
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,160
That was just a chatting with the Jeff Smith earlier today.

439
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,000
He's got an album coming out pretty soon.

440
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
Can't wait to play that on the Charlie.

441
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,040
And I even believe he and Angie B are looking to do

442
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,440
in a couple of, you know, with the love spirals.

443
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,600
Maybe doing a couple of shows out here in Los Angeles.

444
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm really looking forward to reconnecting,

445
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,520
because all of that stuff is just down the hill these days.

446
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,560
Ah, yes.

447
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,160
Nice.

448
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,200
Oh, yeah, I wanted to say that I got a huge compliment

449
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,560
from Patricia's lawyers, an off-handed backhanded compliment.

450
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I might say, you know how I've been basically answering

451
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,400
all of their proposals and emails and doing it all myself.

452
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,880
And actually taking some pleasure in understanding

453
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
what they're saying and how this process works.

454
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
Also, because, you know, I'm not going to, I can't afford a $400

455
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
on how we're lawyer.

456
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,040
For me to tell him what to do for him to talk to the other guy

457
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,200
and for that guy to tell Patricia, no way.

458
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,640
I've been through that too many times, no way.

459
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,520
So her law firm, I should say, squares that these responses

460
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,480
are not coming from me.

461
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,600
They're coming from a lawyer.

462
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,760
I, uh, no.

463
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
Anyway, looks like we might actually just work it out together

464
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,000
and get rid of all these lawyers, uh, and just remove them

465
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,160
from the middle, which I hope works out.

466
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,720
She was going to call me today and, uh, I don't know,

467
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
haven't seen anything yet, but, uh, I'll keep you up to speed.

468
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
Just trying to solve all of that amicably as amicably as possible,

469
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,920
because let me tell you, and again, I'm just generalizing

470
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,200
on the lawyer stuff, but man, these chisters really make it difficult.

471
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,480
It's really, it's really just crazy, particularly if you kind of agree

472
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
on things and then they make it more difficult.

473
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
Who you can't call him, uh, bastards.

474
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,160
Hey, uh, a couple of you sent me a link, uh, regarding bill gates

475
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,400
and Toshiba being in, uh, cooots or investing together

476
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,720
in some kind of miniature nuclear reactor, uh,

477
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,520
what's the name of this company, uh, terror power that you should, uh, you know,

478
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,560
what I would call a backyard nuke that you could, uh, basically drop in and have, uh,

479
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,120
power for the rest of your life and not even have to do anything

480
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,960
no maintenance. I mean, there's a, there seem to be a lot of confusion and of course,

481
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,680
if we have, uh, savants on this show and we're bringing them back,

482
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,040
the one guy who would know all about it would be atomic rod atom.

483
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,960
So I popped him an email and within minutes, he got back to me.

484
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,320
Hey, Adam, atomic rod atoms here, great to hear the DSC back on the air.

485
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,280
You asked me to help clarify the news that is going around regarding bill gates,

486
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,440
Toshiba, terror power and small nuclear power plants.

487
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,680
Fast company got it a little confused. Bill gates is definitely interested in the traveling

488
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:42,880
wave reactors that burned depleted uranium or used uranium from traditional reactors.

489
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,760
Toshiba is definitely interested in small reactors as well as large reactors and they have a

490
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:55,360
design for a 10 megawatt reactor they call the 4s. And there is a company, uh, known as Hyperion

491
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,680
that is developing reactors that are small enough to fit into a hot tub,

492
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,960
but fast company combined all three concepts into a single reactor and came up with a

493
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,360
rather confusing article. The traveling wave reactors minimum size is approximately 300 megawatts

494
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,000
electric that's more than 10 times as large as the hot tub sized Hyperion reactor.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Toshiba and gates have a lot of items in common because they both like long-lived fuel systems

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,200
and then we'll have some material issues that they have to solve together.

497
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,240
Hope that helps and if you have more questions about quote backyard nukes just let me know.

498
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I'll try to help clarify in a short period of time. Take care and great to hear the DSC back

499
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,680
on the air. Keep playing great music and keep making us all smile. Thank you very much.

500
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,120
Atomic rod atoms everybody are a atomic backyard. Actually I like that new that

501
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,120
new meme the hot tub nuke we should keep it at that. Hot tub nuke expert and he's got some other stuff

502
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,160
he's researching of course he has his own show if you want to more about it and I'll put a link

503
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,440
to that in the show notes. I'm very interested as you know I think probably when we dropped off

504
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,280
about a year ago I was still very and I am still very interested in alternative forms of power

505
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,320
and we've got a huge work table here in the hilltop watch tower. I'd have to say this thing is

506
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,240
wow what is it maybe ten eleven feet long and you know I've got all kind basically half of it

507
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,560
Mickey has the other half and I've got all my stuff piled up and eventually my studio will come

508
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,520
from London somewhere around mid April I think so I'll have some more of the the outboard gear

509
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,320
that I love so much piled up and ready to go but also it's great for experimentation and I've

510
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,520
been seeing people doing some amazing stuff with magnets and I just got to think there's something

511
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,360
there and a lot of this experimentation is still being done down under in Australia and if you

512
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,360
you know just look on YouTube you'll you'll see plenty of videos and amazing experiments in Australia

513
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,960
of course the thing that always goes wrong is people who come up with these beautiful works of

514
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,480
engineering art essentially and I'm no tanker I'm not really good with you know with metal and

515
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,760
real physical stuff I can tinker with code and computer stuff so it's going to be interesting actually

516
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,640
I'm looking at drafting a friend of mine and helping the out but whenever someone comes up with something

517
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
like this and they're always going get investors and they want to patented and I don't think anything

518
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,680
like that is ever going to work it's going to be something you can build at home it's going to be probably

519
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:49,760
a combination of some magnets and perhaps a Tesla turbine in order to jack up the power output but I

520
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,600
really do think there is something there so atomic rod the race is on man between your hot tub

540
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,640
living there anymore so I don't get the full influx of media but there is some amazing stuff

541
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,680
happening that were quite unaware of here in the United States it's you know or it's just being

542
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,560
called uh the Greek bailout which uh really well I want to break that down for you in the second

543
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,120
and just give you some thoughts on that because it does affect all of us and essentially our parents

544
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:35,760
are to blame oh yeah our parents are baby boomer parents but first comic strip

545
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:46,560
comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip that's our European correspondent so

546

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,520
block.com by the way I love the return of the Charlie comic strip you made head over to

548
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:09,520
comicstripblock.com have a look at that it was uh yeah scary funny and yet strangely accurate so

549
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,200
recently I was in Brussels copy that of Europe you know yeah yeah I know as we're all the

550
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,800
bastards hang out in bruises and in their Instagram on the top of the Atomium the menu was

551
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,160
only in French I couldn't get one in German all in English yeah the Atomium isn't that the

552
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,840
uh the building that looks like uh like an atom with all the balls connected with with sticks

553
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,480
like an airplane what do we call those uh Tinker toys that's it another example since 2012

554
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,600
the president of European Union Parliament will be a German guy Martin Schultz but uh Tiel 2012

555
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,960
it is a Polish guy a Yezzy Buzek and Buzek speaks English German Russian Polish but the

556
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:05,280
French is our first in him and our first in this uh EU foreign affairs riksann Catherine Achtorn

557
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,000
to learn French I think the French you have too much power don't you think that they have too

558
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,880
much influence in you you you know you guys voted for it oh I'm sorry you didn't vote for it

559
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,560
through the Lisbon Treaty what am I thinking let me tell you what's going on in Europe and uh and by

560
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,600
the way this is all being done with the help of uh of Goldman Sachs uh fine United States

561
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:35,520
based institution I won't say found it but based institution um so as you know uh around 1980

562
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,040
when this whole European Union things started money really started flowing into Greece and Greece

563
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,920
was actually was was doing okay you know there was yeah there were high taxes I don't think the

564
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,960
the the the tax collection rate was that high but really there's only about 20 families that

565
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,200
ran the country and they ran it pretty well uh you know if you know if that's what you want

566
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,160
and you like to be in Greece and I think most people were happy there but once the free money is you

567
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,080
are pointed out on an earlier report to comics or blogger once the free money from the EU started

568
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,720
pouring in it started coming into these Greek families uh the oligarchy I guess should call it

569
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,680
and uh well you can only imagine what happened you know there was uh the brand new airport was

570
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,680
built the company that bid on the airport to bid to build it for 220 million euros it wound up

571
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,160
costing 750 well you can only imagine what happened with the the stray 500 million euros you know

572
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,480
of course people put all in their pocket so lots of money was coming in and uh subsequently

573
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,280
all of this money needs you know you got they got to do something with it so they put it in

574
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,240
Switzerland and another fine places around the world but also brought in all of the American

575
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,680
franchises Kentucky fried chicken and uh McDonald's and oh and let's not forget Ikea just to bring

576
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,840
you know some European franchises in uh pushing out the little guy obviously the little uh

577
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,840
little shop on the corner and uh and the government started borrowing money like nobody else's

578
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,600
business because they could and because it was available not that it was really necessary

579
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,200
and so now they've uh got to pay back I don't know like uh 40 billion euros minimum but probably

580
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,080
260 billion euros in total and what really went wrong is that the and this is the same thing that

581
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,600
happened I think with our our financial problems here in the United States the the baby boomers that

582
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,400
means our parents um and I'm literally on the edge of the baby baby boomer generation but let's

583
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,320
just say our parents you know what they really had to do to secure their pensions and their retirement

584
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,240
funding is they had to sell us their homes and uh you know and pass everything down to the next

585
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,240
generation but the bubble burst you know people got too greedy it didn't happen everything the

586
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,680
devalued deflated and of course all these pension funds they don't actually have all your money

587
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,640
uh they're you know they're speculating with it it's like the social security fund in America you know

588
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,800
it's like they don't actually have all that money and a big pile that they're going to start

589
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,640
dishing out no they're using it for other things and they know they have to pay out a certain amount

590
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,920
to X number of people who retire at age 65 this year and they'll be a little bit more next year

591
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,520
and the year after that and of course it's accelerating because the baby boomers are going

592
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,800
but what happened is uh the financial institutions were about to fall over and that's this happening

593
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,880
now in in Europe Greece uh sure Italy will be actually united kingdom is the one you really have

594
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,640
to watch out for they're really in trouble and there's two ways to handle it one is you can do what

595
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,000
Ireland did and said all right uh austerity measures measures uh everybody retired three years

596
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,360
later and uh we're going to cut your wages and raise your taxes or you know you get a bailout

597
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,200
so France and Germany what they're most worried about is their pension funds because if these

598
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,040
companies go bankrupt which is not a problem by the way it won't bring down the entire world these

599
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,880
companies are going bankrupt people lose money but who are the people they're going to lose the money

600
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,800
it is the baby boomers and their pensions so they're going to saddle us up with all this

601
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,200
debt and all this crap so that they can retire happily and I have seen this I have seen

602
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,400
there was someone in our office who um she'll go unnamed uh but she was uh just into her 60s

603
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,760
and the attitude of the baby boomers of our parents and you know you can hate your parents a little

604
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,160
bit that's allowed I think from time to time it's like I just want my health care I don't care

605
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,280
about anybody else I don't care about the young kids I deserve I want and that's really the

606
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,920
problem that's all I deserve I should have safe life a fair life everything should go my way

607
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,080
well guess what it just doesn't happen that way all right

608
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:25,440
I'ma get in it's a daily day I'ma get in it's a daily way they're coming for you everyday

팀 it.

637
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:03,440
My cof argentine spearhead onidy source code eight twenty four a slow small is the message as always in the music

638
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,480
The less.

639
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,280
mention, uh, not unimportant, that, uh,

640
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,380
John C. Devorick and I are really on, uh,

641
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,480
on a mission to build out no agenda stream.com,

642
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,180
Daily Source Code now a part of that.

643
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,880
It seems to be, uh, working out okay for me to do two shows a week.

644
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,380
Not quite sure if that's going to work out every single week.

645
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,180
So maybe even more, uh, will be daily.

646
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,180
Now probably not, but I still like the Daily Source Code moniker.

647
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
Do you have more things coming on to the stream, though?

648
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,880
And that's where we need your support.

649
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,680
If you would go to no agenda stream.com,

650
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,280
that's where, of course, you can see all of our sustaining producers is a link right there.

651
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,880
If you want to donate, it's Devorick.org slash NAS.

652
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,680
Your support will help get more, more Charlie's on the air,

653
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,680
more no agendas on the air and eventually build a stream,

654
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
which, uh, you can just listen to all the time.

655
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,480
I've been, uh, field testing this myself.

656
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,680
Of course, now I have a car for those of you have been listening to no agenda.

657
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,880
You know, that, uh, I bought a, uh, a 1999 range rover.

658
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,580
The urban assault vehicle, which I can always use for our getaway,

659
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:14,280
because it'll be easy to drive over dead bodies and rubble when the shit hits the fan.

660
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,680
Just in case, um, but what's really working well is listening to the stream on the iPhone.

661
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,180
You know, particularly because it's, uh, well, it's still,

662
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,080
it's rather, uh, low bit rate, uh, it's the same bit rate.

663
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,280
You're hearing the show at right now, but you can kind of just, you know,

664
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,080
flick it on to name whenever you want.

665
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,480
You know, there's always something playing.

666
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,880
Uh, I've got, uh, John's interludes.

667
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,480
He's working on a new one, by the way.

668
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:45,080
Uh, we've got, uh, Devorick Horowitz unplugged, uh, the daily source code,

669
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,480
no agenda, looking to build it up more and more.

670
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:54,580
And I'm seeing on average, on average mind you, uh, now it's not spectacular yet.

671
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,280
But it's, uh, it's about 100 people at any given moment or listening to the stream.

672
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,080
I think that's pretty amazing.

673
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,280
Particularly when you take into account that the New York Times, right?

674
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,280
I asked someone this question, what do you think the circulation is of the New York Times?

675
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
Uh, and you'll hear anywhere from out 10 million, 20 million.

676
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,480
No, actually it's about 900,000.

677
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,880
900,000.

678
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,080
So we don't have that far to go, particularly where the beautiful advent of

679
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:31,480
having the delayed mechanism of podcasts for a lot of these shows and the fact that radio sucks.

680
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Radio everywhere just sucks.

681
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,280
It's two minutes of radio programming for, for a minute of commercial.

682
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,080
Just blows.

683
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,680
Yeah, there's some good stuff.

684
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,480
I'm not going to say everything is horrible, but, you know, thank you very much.

685
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,880
Clear channel, but thank you Internet for blowing it all up.

686
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,680
For, for making people roll up stations have one guy sitting in one market talking to five.

687
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,080
It doesn't work that way anymore.

688
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,080
Those days are over.

689
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,480
Newspapers are next and then it'll be television.

690
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,080
And then it's going to be really bad for a while.

691
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,680
They'll be really, it's really going to suck for everybody.

692
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,480
And then I think stations and initiatives like no agenda stream.com will eventually

693
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,080
start to, to the garner a lot of, a lot of momentum.

694
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,480
It's, you know, a hundred, yeah, it's nothing yet.

695
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,080
Of course, the overall audience of these shows combined is much larger.

696
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,680
But when you can just flick something on or something comes on at a certain moment during the day,

697
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,280
you watch, you watch how this is going to change.

698
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,680
And I sometimes in five years ahead of the, ahead of the curve.

699
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,480
That's okay.

700
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
What else am I going to do?

701
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,480
I got nothing better to do.

702
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,680
I don't know, Adam, I don't know if you remember me, but this is Tokyo Dan.

703
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Hey, Tokyo.

704
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,080
Do you remember me?

705
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,280
I wonder if you're still pissed at me for what I said a few years ago about the pod,

706
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
safe music network.

707
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,480
You know, I heard this comment when I was loading it up.

708
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,080
I'm like, I can't, I don't know what you're talking about, Tokyo Dan.

709
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,680
I, of course, welcome back.

710
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Good to hear you on the show.

711
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,080
But I don't idea what you're talking about, man.

712
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,480
So whatever it was, yeah, I'm still pissed.

713
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,080
Hell yeah.

714
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,480
Anyway, um, I'm glad you're back with the source code is nice to,

715
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,280
hear it, it sounds just like the early days of the source code before you became awakened

716
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,280
and started talking about all the conspiracy stuff, which, eh.

717
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,080
Well, hold on, let's not call it conspiracy.

718
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,880
Well, actually, you can call it conspiracy.

719
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,480
I don't care what you want to call it.

720
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,480
You mean when I actually started understanding how media really works and what they were really doing

721
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,680
and how I was complicit in the entire system.

722
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
You mean those days?

723
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,280
Yeah, absolutely.

724
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,880
It's only gotten worse than.

725
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,280
But yeah, I, I feel you.

726
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,080
And it wasn't easy.

727
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,080
It wasn't easy for me.

728
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,480
It wasn't easy for the people around me.

729
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,480
And I don't think it was easy for the chuckleheads, either.

730
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,680
Like, oh, oh, what's wrong with that?

731
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,680
I'm, let's look up the definition of the schizophrenia here.

732
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,880
Sometimes like to hear, but not all the time, I kind of, I tend to agree with what you say

733
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,480
and I do listen to the noise in every once in a while.

734
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,080
And by the way, that's cool.

735
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,280
You don't have to listen to every single episode or have to listen to it.

736
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,280
There's no rule that says you have to listen to no agenda in its entirety.

737
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,080
Check it anytime you want.

738
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,280
It's kind of funny, though.

739
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,280
How people are so willing to sit in a dark room with a hundred other strangers,

740
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:31,280
spend $50 for the pleasure of sitting in a seat for an hour and a half

741
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,680
completely silently watching a movie.

742
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,680
You know, you think that you can listen to 45 minutes of the source code

743
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,680
or two hours of no agenda actually learn something, not be interrupted by commercials.

744
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,680
And you can fart whenever you want.

745
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,680
But I'd prefer more of a tech podcast that listen to a lot of tech podcasts

746
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,680
and just, you know, some music and stuff like that.

747
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Just like the daily source code used to be.

748
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
And that's what it sounds like you're doing now.

749
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,680
But really got me interested was when you're talking about developing an iPhone

750
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,680
app, which is really cool because that's what I've been doing for about the last few months.

751
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,680
I want a bottle kind of books and everything bought some macintoshes

752
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,680
and I've been working with XCode and studied Objective Sea

753
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
and getting back into programming.

754
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,680
Yeah, you know, it sounds like you kind of on the same track as I am.

755
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,680
And this started for me also a couple of months ago.

756
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,680
I got to say, you know, for me there's almost no difference in the amount of effort

757
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,680
I have to put into responding to a lawyer's letter.

758
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,680
As there is to programming some functionality in Objective Sea.

759
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,680
And I have to say, I love this XCode thing because they set up with an application

760
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,680
that's kind of bare bones and ready to go.

761
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,680
And you just start copying and pasting and adjusting.

762
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,680
And of course, there's absolute truth in programming.

763
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Because if you miss type something, one word, one, you know,

764
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,680
semi colon or anything like that, it's just not going to work.

765
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,680
But it's, yeah, I'm amazed that how much I could actually accomplish and get done.

766
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,680
And I'm very excited about my iPhone app.

767
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,680
Still not released.

768
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,680
I haven't even submitted it to the iTunes store yet.

769
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,680
And I can't tell you about it because it doesn't do it justice.

770
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,680
I've done something that I believe no one has thought of yet.

771
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,680
I can't even, I don't even want to tell you that.

772
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,680
I don't want to say anything until you actually have it in your hands.

773
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,680
When you have it in your hands, you're going to go, oh shit.

774
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
Okay, I get it.

775
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,680
Now I understand why he couldn't talk about it.

776
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,680
Go by the way, the iPhone app that I'm developing will be free.

777
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:43,680
And I'm looking forward to the episode, the third episode of the new source code.

778
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,680
When you talk more about your app and your programming.

779
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
I have to hear more about that.

780
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,680
And as far as podcasting goes, your comments about the expectations,

781
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,680
you know, not living up to the expectations I agree for there.

782
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,680
It's kind of a pipe dream.

783
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,680
Love people expected too much.

784
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,680
I have an podcast that's for almost a year and a half.

785
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,680
No, and I don't think I'll ever go back.

786
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,680
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the next show.

787
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
Take good news.

788
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
Hi, Tokyo Dan.

789
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,680
Thank you so much, man.

790
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,680
Good to hear from you.

791
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,680
I don't really have time to open up phone lines like I had previously,

792
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
and to go through all voice comments.

793
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,680
So if you do have something you'd like to contribute to the show,

794
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,680
just maybe the best thing is to drop it off at drop.io.

795
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,680
It's a free service, pretty good service.

796
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Got a lot of, you know, I love what those guys do.

797
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,680
And they've got a lot of, with bang stuff,

798
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,680
but it's also just handy, just to drop it in.

799
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,680
I think I also have a drop box, actually.

800
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,680
That might, that might even be better.

801
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,680
Adam at mevio.com.

802
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,680
Not what you're, how you share the information about your drop box.

803
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,680
But let me see.

804
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,680
I'm looking at it right now.

805
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,680
Do I have anything new in there?

806
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,680
No.

807
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,680
I don't think so.

808
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,680
I think you can just drop stuff in there.

809
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,680
If you know my email address, I'm not quite sure.

810
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
So that's a way to get it to me.

811
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,680
Just, but basically just put a,

812
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,680
an MP3 together and throw it off to me.

813
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,680
All right.

814
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,680
Moving up, we're actually coming up on one hour.

815
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,680
And I have a five o'clock appointment in an hour and a half with,

816
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,680
ooh, yes.

817
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,680
With a tax person.

818
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,680
We're coming up on that time as well.

819
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,680
And you know me, Mr. Last Minute Man.

820
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Adam coming.

821
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,680
Take a sauce code.

822
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,680
Adam coming.

823
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Adam coming.

824
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,680
Adam coming.

825
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Adam coming.

826
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,680
Adam coming.

827
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,680
Adam coming.

828
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
All right.

829

on the full bar Friday the source code episode 824 i'm not quite sure when we're going to hit it on

888
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,760
when we're going to hit another source code next week monday i'm going to up north to

889
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,240
flying into oakland going to pick up the delta siera which is oakland north there's a southern

890
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,600
part of the airport where the big planes come in and then the northern part going to meet captain Dave there

891
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,200
we're going to fire her up and she's been sitting there for a number of months so we're pretty

892
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,080
sure the battery's going to be dead we're going to fire her up and then we're going to fly her down

893
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:45,480
i think the sand hose is a as the plane has to have an annual before April 1st otherwise it won't

894
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,920
be allowed to fly at all so that kind of sucks because that's actual cost involved and it's been

895
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:58,120
on the market for a good six weeks now without a couple nipples maybe but you know it's like boats

896
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,400
you know it's not a really good time to be selling an aircraft but there you go i don't have enough

897
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:10,280
time to fly and a part of my plan for 2010 was to have that is my backup so i can really focus 100

898
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,080
percent on a no agenda stream dot com and on the shows that go along with that so what that means

899
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,920
for everything else well you make up your own mind you can certainly see through the veil

900
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,240
so i'll talk to you get on sunday for early service no agenda around nine o'clock sometime next week
