And with your courage and strength, we'll fit away.

160
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Now that I'm wiser,

161
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,660
The dream was a spider.

162
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:10,660
You heard me with your promises of promises.

163
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,660
TV killed me.

164
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Find out.

165
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,660
I'm sending my Marcus couch Marcus once again.

166
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:33,660
You saved me my proof of magnified TV killed me.

167
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Perfect for the footballer Friday.

168
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,660
Daily source code episode 828 and the chat room is buzzing.

169
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,660
We're almost in a perfect state.

170
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,660
All we need of course is one of our porn star friends to show up.

171
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,660
And then it'll be outstanding for the footballer Friday.

172
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
But of course, you can't have everything.

173
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Although Bobby Eden did promise.

174
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Well, let's need to hear you know there.

175
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Hey, what the hell is going on?

176
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
I've been on the phone all day.

177
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,660
I've been getting email messages from people saying, hey, you know, I got a friend over

178
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
an Amsterdam, someone in Luxembourg.

179
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,660
They need to get to different spots in Europe.

180
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Can you hook me up?

181
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Anyone with an airplane?

182
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,660
So I've been calling around to all my general aviation buddies.

183
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,660
And everything is closed down, not just the jets that fly at higher altitude.

184
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,660
And this of course, because of the ash cloud that is supposedly floating over Western and

185
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Northern Europe.

186
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,660
And I got to tell you, this is something really weird.

187
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,660
First of all, the weather is beautiful in get-monation lowlands.

188
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Everything I'm hearing from my boys is it is beautiful flying weather.

189
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
It's never been so clear.

190
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,660
I can't count the number of emails and tweets that I've received from people saying, hey,

191
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,660
it's really nice all this ash stuff that's supposed to be here because, well, there's no

192
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
chemtrails.

193
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
It's nice and clear.

194
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Blue sky, perfect aviation weather.

195
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,660
But no, we're all grounded.

196
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,660
I heard one of my buddies was flying back from France.

197
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,660
And he took off from a small air strip.

198
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,660
And of course, it shouldn't be too much of a problem if you're flying with a

199
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,660
non-turban engine at low altitude.

200
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,660
He immediately got to Mirage's next to him.

201
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
Another report forcing him to land, by the way.

202
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Another report from a guy took off from a private strip in the United Kingdom.

203
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660
Royal Air Force forced him down.

204
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
This is weird.

205
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,660
You know, it's one thing for air traffic control to say, hey, you know,

206
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,660
buddy, you can't fly because it's dangerous.

207
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,660
It's another one to have air force jets forcing small,

208
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,660
sessmas, and moonies, and TBMs down on the ground.

209
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,660
And I have heard a couple of theories that, hey, maybe something else is going on.

210
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,660
I'd love to get a weather report from people in Europe who are in the chat room.

211
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Because there's just no ash.

212
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Now, I know there is ash.

213
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
And I know it's up there at high altitude.

214
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,660
But there's nothing at lower altitudes yet everybody is grounded.

215
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,660
And actually, got an email from the Candyman,

216
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,660
a frequent contributor to the show into a Norwegian and a Norwegian stream.

217
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,660
And he said, oh, it's got a nice, you know, people who are in town,

218
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
or we're all having a party, and we're hanging out.

219
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,660
And I get the very distinct weird feeling.

220
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
It's a little bit like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

221
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,660
It feels strange to me, and it could last for days, weeks, or months.

222
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,660
This is a disaster of economic proportions that we do not yet know.

223
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
The outcome, but it's bad.

224
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
It is football.

225
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Fits in where the theme for today.

226
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Billy, I know the remedy.

227
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
It's a little dancing.

228
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,660
It came dancing to my food.

229
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,660
And last night, a little angel came up and on the floor.

230
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,660
She said, hey, come baby, but I just hold up.

231
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
And if it excites,

232
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
grey half from above,

233
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
the house,

234
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
in the night hall,

235
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,660
she brought more, more, more.

236
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,660
We'll rebel yet,

237
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,660
she brought more, more, more, more.

238
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
Why not?

239
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,660
We'll never know, baby, more, more, more.

240
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:28,660
We'll rebel yet, more, more, more, more.

241
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:37,660
She don't like saving, she won't save her baby

242
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,660
The world's our love and she's needs to live

243
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,660
What sets you free, what's it to me baby

244
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,660
What sets you free, I need you here by me

245
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,660
In the midnight hour, she come home, home, home

246
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,660
With a rebel year, she come home, home, home

247
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,660
In the midnight hour, home, home, home

248
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,660
With a rebel year, home, home

249
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,660
With a rebel year, she come home

250
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,660
With a rebel year, home

251
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
With a rebel year, home, home

252
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,660
With a rebel year, home

253
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,660
With a rebel year, home

254
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
With a rebel year, home

255
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,660
With a rebel year, home

256
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
With a rebel year, home

257
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,660
With a rebel year, home

258
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Yes, yes, yes

259
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:27,660
I want the world to be faded

260
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,660
A thousand miles with you

261
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,660
I drive your tears upon you

262
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,660
A million times to begin

263
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,660
I'd sell my soul

264
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,660
One bullet you burn for me

265
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,660
I give you all and I love me

266
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,660
Yes, I give you all and give you all the time

267
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,660
I give you all the pain

268
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
In a midnight hour

269
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,660
She's my mom, mom, mom

270
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Will her ever live

271
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
She's my mom, mom, mom, mom

272
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Oh, in a midnight hour

273
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Mom, mom, mom

274
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Will her ever live

275
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,660
She's my mom, mom, mom, mom

276
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Will her ever live

277
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,660
She's my mom, mom, mom

278
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Will her ever live

279
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,660
She's my mom, mom, mom

280
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:17,220
One, two, ah. Well, that was totally weird. All of a sudden, all of my MIDI controls

281
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,500
just went blank. Ah, hate it when that happens. Billy Idol and the Rebel Yell on the

282
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,500
daily source code A2A, it is the chuckle all the chuckle heads in the chat room at nogen.chat.com.

283
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,180
I just want to continue just for another second here about this ash cloud. I got to

284
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,940
tell you, I just have a really, really bad feeling. Of course, there's all kinds of

285
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,460
theories, theories rolling about in in circles that I travel in about what could really

286
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,140
be going on. But it makes no real sense to ground even general aviation. I mean, particularly

287
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,180
when the skies are just absolutely clear. And they've got these jets forcing people down.

288
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,860
It just, it feels bad. The amount of economic damage this is causing is huge. And the

289
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,580
reports that are coming in, you can't rent a car anymore. The trains are packed. The traffic

290
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,220
on the way to the boat terminals is just outrageous. How long will this last? Do we really

291
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,860
think it's going to be over within a day or two? Here's the latest I've got apparently

292
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:24,380
tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. They may be opening up the skies over Europe again. But this

293
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:30,060
volcano in Iceland is still pooping out this pew. Is that even a phrase you can use?

294
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm going to probably shut up. Ah, shit, not that one. This one. Don't worry, CSB coming

295
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:53,740
late. It's totally full bar Friday, that's obvious. It works so far, but we're not out yet.

296
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:02,180
I want to know what you're thinking. Them some things you can't hide. Got a pretty cool email

297
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,420
from Scott Taylor, who's been to Corresponding with Paul Ross from Information Society.

298
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:14,820
Remember those guys? Infosoc. My way Paul says hello Adam. He remembers me from the old

299
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:22,940
MTV days and says, go ahead man. Play my shit on the Charlie. Love to do that. Pure energy.

300
00:23:32,180 --> 00:24:02,180
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

301
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:32,180
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, go, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can't see, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no- we're all our way, we're just done for 1 and all of we're doomed to fight for

302
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:39,180
You're feeling down the walks of your mind

303
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,180
I know I like to break you down

304
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,180
Don't walk the world out to you

305
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,180
I could show you

306
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,180
The more you say it's true

307
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Maybe I'm tired

308
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,180
It's a game I can't play

309
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,180
You are tired

310
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,180
But nothing else to say

311
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
I don't know

312
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
What you're thinking

313
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,180
There was something you can't hide

314
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,180
I don't know what you're feeling

315
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Tell me what's on your mind

316
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,180
Don't walk the world out to you

317
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
You're feeling down

318
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
You're feeling down

319
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,180
You are tired

320
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,180
You are tired

321
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,180
You are tired

322
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,180
You are tired

323
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:53,180
I want to know what you're thinking

324
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Never something you can't hide

325
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,180
I want to know what you're feeling

326
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Tell me what's on your mind

327
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,180
I want to know what you're thinking

328
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Never something you can't hide

329
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,180
I want to know what you're feeling

330
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Tell me what's on your mind

331
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Yeah who knows could be pure energy

332
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,180
Information society on the daily source code

333
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
This is episode eight to eight

334
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,180
So I just want to harp one more moment here

335
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
By the way pun intended

336
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,180
I want to harp one more time here about this this ash cloud

337
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,180
But of course so always starts of volcanic eruption

338
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
With some shift in the tectonic plates

339
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
So we don't really know what's going on

340
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,180
But all the lame stream news media can talk about

341
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Is oh the flights the flights

342
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Yeah how about the mail?

343
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,180
How about airlines that are used to bring stuff

344
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Over from well China?

345
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
How about food moving around?

346
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
You know there is a rather interesting percentage

347
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Of aviation that is not just moving people around

348
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
You know

349
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,180
This is this is really pretty big

350
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,180
I mean remember how horrible it was

351
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,180
After nine eleven companies went out of business

352
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Not just aviation companies

353
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
It's I just think it's really big

354
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
And I don't think people are really looking at

355
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,180
The extent of what the damage really could be

356
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,180
And I hope that the authorities aren't being to

357
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Cavalier with locking this stuff down

358
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I mean we do have to keep stuff moving

359
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,180
And I know that we have some friends at euro control

360
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,180
I'm not going to mention who but long time listeners

361
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,180
And actually donors to know agenda and the know agenda stream

362
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
And hopefully we'll be getting some more insight information

363
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
As it comes along

364
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,180
I will say though by no coincidence

365
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,180
This article from new scientist

366
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Titled mysterious radio waves

367
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Amitting from galaxy nearby

368
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Something strange in the cosmic neighborhood

369
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
It opens

370
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,180
An unknown object is nearing galaxy M82

371
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,180
And it started sending out radio waves

372
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
And the emissions

373
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Looks like nothing ever seen anywhere in the universe before

374
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,180
Now this thing appeared last May

375
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,180
But now it's starting to

376
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,180
To send out radio transmissions

377
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,180
And it does not fit the pattern of radio emissions

378
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
From a supernova or no way

379
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Usually they get brighter over a few weeks

380
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,180
And then fade away over the months

381
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
But this just may get louder and louder

382
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I'm just saying

383
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Of course we had some tragedy

384
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,180
Earlier in the week, very early in the week with the Polish president

385
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,180
And the large portion of the Polish government

386
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Parishing in a fiery plane crash in Russia

387
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,180
And no better than to talk to our European correspondent

388
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Who actually hails from there to give us his take on what actually went down

389
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Comic strip

390
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Comic strip

391
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
Comic strip

392
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Comic strip

393
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Comic strip

394
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
All right

395
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
So you just be like here

396
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Hello Adam Los Angeles Gary

397
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,180
So in the 1939 German signed with Russians

398
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Packed code Molotov

399
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
We've been through a pack

400
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Yeah, we talked about that on our agenda actually

401
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,180
Yeah, and in fact this pipeline is exactly what

402
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Kaczynski said was the new version of that

403
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,180
And this pack divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence

404
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,180
And the coast among others, annexation

405
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Invasion annexation of Estonia by Soviet Union

406
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Estonia is the country where Skype was developed originally

407
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Yes, of course

408
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
I always thought it was them

409
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
April 9th last week

410
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,180
April 9th 2010 Molotov

411
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
Revenge of pack to zero started

412
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,180
There were big celebrations

413
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,180
To start building pipeline from Russia to Germany

414
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Under the sea without going through Poland or any other countries

415
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
Yeah, which would of course piss Poland off

416
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Poland could talk about maybe sabotaging the pipeline

417
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
All kinds of stuff could have been happening at that point

418
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,180
CSB and announced only a few days before this tragic accident

419
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
One day later

420
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,180
One day later an airplane with anti-Russian Polish President

421
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
Creshti Russia

422
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
Coincidence?

423
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
I think not

424
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Yes, what?

425
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
That was pilot error

426
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Dao

427
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,180
CSB, you may know a lot about Europe

428
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,180
But you know sure about aviation man

429
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,180
Pilot tried to land in deep fog

430
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Yeah, yeah

431
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,180
You've been reading too many reports from the FSB

432
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
Deep fog

433
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
It was a 1500-foot ceiling

434
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,180
It wasn't all that deep on an airport

435
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,180
That doesn't have instruments

436
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,180
It was such landing

437
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Not also not true

438
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,180
They had FAR radar

439
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,180
And the traffic control tower had them on a glide slow

440
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,180
So they absolutely knew where they were

441
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,180
And the instruments were communicating with the instruments

442
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,180
With the instrumentation on the ground

443
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,180
That's what you can read from the same report by the way

444
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
And Russia

445
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
Once from European Union

446
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,180
To abolish the visas

447
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
To EU relations

448
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
And I have to tell you, I agree

449
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,180
Russians are more European than some old EU members

450
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
I don't

451
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
I will not say which

452
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
But

453
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Right

454
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
And they should not

455
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,180
They should go to European Union without visa

456
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
Okay

457
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
You

458
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
You

459
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Well, take my comments to heart there

460
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
CSB

461
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I think we need to look at that a little bit closer

462
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,180
That finally got my rock sugar city in

463
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,180
And I got a plan track

464
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
Heaven and Heaven

465
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,180
So guys, do the matchups live

466
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,180
I love them

467
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Oh

468
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Thinking about our young years

469
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,180
It was only only

470
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,180
We were young and wild and free

471
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Now nothing can take you away

472
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Even down and over for

473
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,180
That's over now

474
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,180
Keep coming and back to work

475
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
And be the one I want

476
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,180
When you lie here in my arms

477
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,180
But finally we have to live

478
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
We're never

479
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:03,180
And never listen to our way

480
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,180
I should do it every day

481
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:16,180
We're never listen to our way

482
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
Oh

483
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,180
Thinking about our young years

484
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
It was only only

485
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,180
We were young and free

486
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,180
So it was only only

487
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,180
We were living

488
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
And never listen to our way

489
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,160
I wish to learn

490
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,180
My heart was just a lie

491
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
So I wish to learn

492
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
And never listen to our way

493
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Instead of smiling

494
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,180
I never listen to our way

495
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Otherwise

496
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,180
I'm walking in with a girl

497
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,180
I'm on the train

498
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,180
And I'm on the train

499
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
It isn't too hard to say

500
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,180
We're never

501
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,180
We're never

502
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,180
And never is it too far away

503
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,180
We're never is it too far away

504
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,180
We're never is it too far away

505
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,180
We're never is it too far away

506
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,180
We'll find our way

507
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:10,180
We're never is it too far away

508
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,180
We're never is it too far away

509
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,180
We're never is it too far away

510
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,180
We're never is it too far away

511
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,180
We're never is it too far Correct

512
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
We're never is it too far away

513
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,180
We're never is it too far away

514
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:50,180
No matter what your friends say, I'm the one that got up on the road.

515
00:36:50,180 --> 00:37:14,980
Man, I don't know who masters that ship, but as loud rock sugar, you can find

516
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,980
him at rock sugarband.com, heaven and heaven from the album filled with mashouts.

517
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,780
And just totally kicks ass.

518
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,180
I have it on my iPod listen to it continuously.

519
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
I love it.

520
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:36,980
I want to give a shout out to Andrew Bryn Joe, the guys at mevio for making mevio.com compatible

521
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
with iPads and iPhones.

522
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,980
Unbelievable how they did it, but HTML5 implementation worked like a charm.

523
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,980
It's just so much fun watching it now on the iPhone.

524
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,980
Back to the movies with a damn new world.

555
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,800
News of the program, this is the daily source code my name is Adam Curry.

556
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,840
The original Danny Ogre news thoroughbred ly.

557
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,440
We play music like...

558
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,660
you used to hear on the radio.

559
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,040
You know?

560
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,460
And just kinda do a different stuff in hang out and talk and play sweet tunes and ahhh and oh yea

561
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,500
We've got friends.

562
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,580
We call him Chuckleheads.

563
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:32,700
Oh my fellow chuckleheads, I'm gonna be a part of us against a name of rain on the shore.

564
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,140
Hey everyone, how are you doing?

565
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:40,980
Before I forget, don't fly the Delta Shara across the northern part of Europe.

566
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,420
You could be facing a major cloud of ashes.

567
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:52,140
As you know, last month, an island volcano under the glacier erupted for the first time since 1823.

568
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,340
7 to 800 inhabitants were evacuated.

569
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,820
Airports were shut down and flights grounded across northern Europe.

570
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,700
In the meantime, China is dealing with a 6.9 magnitude earthquake.

571
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,700
The death toll rose to 617, and more than 9,000 people had been injured.

572
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:18,540
But striking about this, the earthquake to place well just to desaster exercise in the neighborhood was being held.

573
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,100
Didn't we talk about this before?

574
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,820
The Earth is shaking more and more and I feel that's increasingly the case.

575
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,100
It's going on.

576
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,420
In the meantime, my homeland's the Netherlands is dealing with the economical crisis.

577
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,220
The Dutch Defence Department bought new bombs for the F-16 fighters.

578
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:42,780
This seems to be needed to make it possible to hit targets at a greater distance so we can't be harassed by the enemy.

579
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,500
These bombs of the type of Shara Delta Bravo 1 made by Boeing.

580
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,260
Cust our government in a amount of $40 million.

581
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:58,140
While the authorities in Iraq had issued a warning for a new weapon that terrorists increasingly used to attack.

582
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,460
On the magnet bomb, well that's gotta be a lot cheaper.

583
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,660
So that's $40 fucking million dollars.

584
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,460
Another 2 million dollars are about to be wasted on a stupid sucker game.

585
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:16,540
In order to prevent clashes between supported groups, a massive police department will be prepared to

586
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,820
the cup final between F-Nort and Iraq's in Rotterdam on April the 25th.

587
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,300
What's going on man?

588
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,780
It's just a terrible waste of money.

589
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,100
Anyway, there's gotta be some good news.

590
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,900
Twitter has more than 105 million users.

591
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,100
There are 300,000 new ones every day.

592
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,780
Go find her best owners and announce that the website attracts

593
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,540
118 million human visitors monthly.

594
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,300
Currently, each day approximately 50 million messages are posted on Twitter.

595
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,780
Well, I think it's a great way to communicate to the world.

596
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,500
So, as you see, a lot of numbers are messing with my brain.

597
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,860
And I feel the need to come down and enjoy the weekend.

598
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,860
Take care Adam. Bye bye now.

599
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

600
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,220
Thank you very much, Ray.

601
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,500
Always great to have you and Ray on the charming.

602
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,940
Crazy way to get your kids.

603
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,180
You shoot the silicone in your lips.

604
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,940
In your figure, make your sad.

605
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,100
You start the fat right off your back.

606
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,100
Make up your mind about your chance girls

607
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,100
You can puff him up, so no problem with any girls

608
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,100
Only one thing they can fix

609
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
No I won't let you be in this line

610
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
That's the only you'll have

611
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,100
Getting nothing by that

612
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,100
Yeah, I'm out on the world

613
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,100
You're the only boys and girls

614
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Hell, hell, the kind of green

615
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
Hell, hell, to what I see

616
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Hell, hell, hell, there's monologue

617
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,100
Tell her that she's beautiful

618
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,100
I put her on a pedestal

619
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
But as you cook a trip less

620
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Imagination kicks in

621
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
The more you think about sex for

622
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,100
We're someone else, the better it gets for me

623
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,100
You have a perm for seeing a life

624
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Besides cheating on the wife

625
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,100
For fucks sake, shows off the same

626
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Hell, hell, monologue

627
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Hell, the world is a good

628
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
Hell, hell, the kind of green

629
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,100
Hell, hell, to what I see

630
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,100
Hell, hell, there's monologue

631
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Hell, hell, hell, there's monologue

632
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
Hell, hell, hell, there's monologue

633
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Today's adoption is a hot thing

634
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,100
You can get a child from nearly nothing

635
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,100
You take him home to an enemy

636
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,100
By all of you get with toys and candy

637
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,100
But all the money that you work for girls

638
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,100
Can compare with you a little bit

639
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
There's only one thing they can fix

640
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,100
No, I won't let you be this glad

641
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
And that's the only go hell

642
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,100
Can you nothing about that?

643
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Hell, hell, monologue

644
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,100
Hell, the world is a good girl

645
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
Hell, hell, the kind of green

646
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,100
Hell, hell, do what I see

647
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,100
Hell, hell, this monologue

648
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

649
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

650
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

651
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

652
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,100
My special request for Miss Micky, a new Cmodon World

653
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,100
Find Dutch product once again from Gimmonation Lowlands

654
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,100
Love that track

655
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,100
It's funny to see the, uh, the gootaheads in the chat room all going

656
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Ah, I've heard that song so many times

657
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Yeah, how do you know what?

658
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,100
It's time to share

659
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
So not a heavier attention

660
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,100
I know we have plenty of cis admins

661
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,100
And network admins who are

662
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,100
In the realm of chuckleheads who listen to this show

663
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
And no agenda either or

664
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,100
Two things one

665
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,100
If you are waiting for the email for the cis admins opportunity

666
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
The cis opportunity

667
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,100
Haven't sent it out yet

668
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,100
So you haven't missed anything

669
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,100
It is forthcoming

670
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,100
And thank you all for sending in your emails

671
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,100
And your interest in the project

672
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,100
Which is purely a money-making venture for you

673
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,100
My way of giving back if you're interested

674
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,100
One other thing though that we did talk about

675
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,100
I think on the previous early morning Sunday servers of no agenda

676
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,100
We need a push notification server for

677
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,100
Well for us

678
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,100
Not just the no agenda

679
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,100
Malicia but for the chuckleheads

680
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,100
And the reason why

681
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,100
Is I'd like to make a service

682
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,100
That anyone who makes an iPhone app

683
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,100
And potentially

684
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Um

685
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,100
I'm not quite sure how it works in Android

686
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,100
But for G phone apps

687
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
But you know let's look at the iPhone

688
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,100
And the iPad

689
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,100
We're talking about a universe of 50 million

690
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,100
We need a service that anyone can tie their app into

691
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Because this gives you better than email

692
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
It gives you these notifications

693
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,100
So at any point if something happens

694
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,100
And we need to convene

695
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,100
Everyone can start firing off messages

696
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,100
Through their apps

697
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,100
And they'll start popping up

698
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
And for some reason I think it really could work

699
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,100
So we have to hook in

700
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,100
iPhones that subscribe to

701
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Um

702
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,100
This service

703
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,100
And then

704
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,100
Can receive messages that send it out

705
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,100
To the uh

706
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,100
Was it the Apple push notification server

707
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,100
And once we have that

708
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,100
I think we could have a pretty

709
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,100
Interesting network

710
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,100
That we could use to our advantage

711
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,100
And just looking around

712
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,100
Times are drawing near my friends

713
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Now I know I've been a long version of money

714
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
For nothing not too long going

715
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,100
If we were a Friday

716
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,100
But this is a mashup from DJ Moore

717
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,100
And here really brings it all together

718
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,100
The dire strength of sex

719
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,100
There's those basement jacks

720
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Queen you name it

721
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,100
All messed up on the Charlie

722
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:18,100
And then you know

723
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,100
That's the way you do

724
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,100
When it gets out on your team

725
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
That ain't working

726
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,100
That's the way you do

727
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,100
One and one of them is just the free

728
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,100
That ain't working

729
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,100
That's the way you do

730
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,100
Let me tell you

731
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,100
When guys end up

732
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,100
Baby get up

733
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,100
That's the way you do

734
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,120
If we look you

735
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,100
Just don't know what to say

736
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,100
Better before you

737
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,100
Better when you do

738
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,100
Yeah, it's the way, stop

739
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,100
Yeah, it's the way, stop

740
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,600
Do it now, no way, do it now

741
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,100
Yeah, it's the way, stop

742
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,600
temptation is what we're doing

743
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Yeah, it's the way, stop

744
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah, it's the way, stop

745
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,100
I never wouldn't do

746
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:13,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

747
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

748
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

749
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:25,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

750
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

751
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

752
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:41,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

753
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:48,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

754
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:56,100
I shouldn't blame you to take the gates out

755
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:26,100

last couple years but all my shows up on mebios still still bring in the

787

791
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,260
of missed the LA life every now and then but definitely keep up the good work
