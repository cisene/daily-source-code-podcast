337
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,040
of throw them into one big bin, which we call folders these days. And I'm just a role

338
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,040
and I'm out as the feeling comes to me and on and in. It's one sprawl you chuckle

On the full bar

351
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,560
We visited, which we call the Snaphu

352
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Snaphu Saturday, everybody in the morning to you

353
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Coming to you at noagendastream.com

354
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
If you're listening and you have any opportunity to get to a computer

355
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
The real party for the shows at noagendachat.com

356
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,560
That's where we, well it seems like we're talking about football today

357
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,560
I'm not, I'm definitely not in a world cup kind of mood

358
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
That's for sure

359
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
But that's where we eventually get into some kind of interactive thing

360
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Where people start throwing songs out and then they just kind of flow

361
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
And usually these shows can last anywhere from an hour to two hours

362
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
We'll see that we come up with today

363
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,560
But my physical max is definitely two hours

364
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,560
And my physical tolerance has been kind of low for the past week and a half

365
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
I got really sick about 10 days ago

366
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
With some kind of virus

367
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
And I think a whole bunch of things came out at once

368
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
You'll know that it was Thursday a week ago

369
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,560
That I was actually quite sick while we're doing noagenda

370
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
So it was two shows ago

371
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
And after that I just kind of collapsed

372
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,560
And I couldn't wake up, I had to sleep, just continuously

373
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
I had no energy

374
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Most of my bodily fluids were draining quite rapidly

375
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
I'll spare you the details of that

376
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,560
And of course that's not just because of a physical health issue

377
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
There's some other things going on

378
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
And one in general

379
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Which for those of you who've been listening to this program for

380
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Well 834 episodes by now you might have caught one or two

381
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,560
And for those of you who have listened to

382
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,560
209 or some of the episodes of Noagenda

383
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,560
You know that there's one major life choice that I have to make

384
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,560
And it's been bugging me for probably about five years now

385
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,560
And a combination of things last Thursday

386
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Set off a perfect storm

387
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Like a spark in a Tinder box

388
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
And it doesn't really matter

389
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,560
How what where for what reason

390
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,560
That'll all matter later after I've made my choices

391
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
And maybe then we can talk about it more in depth

392
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,560
And that'll be something we definitely will discuss on the daily source code

393
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Just right now it's not prudent and not fair to a number of people to do that

394
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,560
But I lost my shit

395
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
And I embarrassed myself

396
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,560
And I upset a lot of people, interestingly enough

397
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Not so much the recipient of my shit lossage

398
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Luckily because Johnson to work is my friend

399
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
He is my best friend

400
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,560
And confidant and colleague

401
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,560
But actually you guys for those of you who are crossovers

402
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Between chuckle heads and

403
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,560
And producers of the Noagenda show

404
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,560
And I'm really sorry about that

405
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,560
So no apology I give here is going to make any difference

406
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
The words matter and actions matter

407
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
But I feel really bad

408
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
And then I realize what it is

409
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
It's something that has to change within my own life

410
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Something that I've been

411
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Struggling with for quite a long time

412
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
And actually all of this will have a very positive outcome

413
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Because it's finally given me the strength to do what I need to do

414
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
So I'm actually quite excited about it

415
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
And I'd like to celebrate that with some feedback

416
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
It always helps a little bit

417
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Maybe if we just kick some jams out really really hard

418
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
You'll understand how I'm feeling right now

419
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
You'll understand how I'm feeling

420
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560

You'll understand how I'm telling

You'll understand how I'm feeling

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,560
You'll understand how I'm feeling

438
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,580
You'll understand how I'm honestly feeling

439
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
You'll understand how I'm feeling

440
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580

You'll understand how I'm feeling

444
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,580
You'll understand how I'm feeling

445
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,820
Play for me

446
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,140
Do I say I'm not your girl?

447
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:26,140
I don't like that, but you're in the way

448
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:37,140
If you want to call, then I would love

449
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:45,140
And you think I would stay, I'd say I had you needed for

450
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Three days, three days, any more

451
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:01,140
Yes, this is

452
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:08,140
I don't like that, but you're in the way

453
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:16,140
I don't like that, but you're in the way

454
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:26,140
I don't like that, but you're in the way

455
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,140
Yeah, yeah, for those of you wondering who that is, that's news, hyper music

456
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:55,140
I mean those guys are really good, and hit me every single time right in the gut

457
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:02,140
As do calls like this, I love receiving emails

458
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,140
And voice recordings from chuckleheads who've been around and to hear them come around and come back

459
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,140
This is the stuff that I'm remembering now, why I do it, why I do what I do, why I should do more of what I'm really good at

460
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,140
And less of what I really have no passion for

461
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,140
I don't like that, but I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that

462
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,140
I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that

463
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,140
I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that

464
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:50,140
I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that

465
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,140
It was a neat thing because you became almost a human aggregator for me

466
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,140
On top of the great daily conversation and the insight into just another human beings life

467
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,140
It was always interesting to see the music you were pulling

468
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,140
And the promos that you were playing, because that really started to get me expanding my horizons

469
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:17,140
And other podcasts, things like Catholic Insider, Don and Drew, the bitterest pill with Dan Klass

470
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,140
Even radio adventures with Dr. Floyd and G-Wiz, I don't know, I have one point

471
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,140
I was up to 48 or 50 podcasts that I was trying to listen to

472
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,140
But at least I had an hour and a half long commute that now

473
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,140
I got about seven minutes, so it's a little bit of a different model for me as well

474
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,140
But great to hear that you're alive and well and back on the wagon

475
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,140
I guess you could say, all right, but have yourself a great day today

476
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,140
And I will be listening to you soon. Thanks, man, I really appreciate it

477
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
You know, when I hear that list of names and I hear

478
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,140
And there's a couple of people from the old days in the chat room, Mark is couch

479
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Who is still hanging in there with the scenes he now, I think it's just celebrated five years

480
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,140
You know, things turned out much differently, then I had hope they would back in the day

481
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Much much differently

482
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:16,140
And I think if anything, probably the name podcast is what killed the whole idea

483
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,140
And that in the fact that it turns out you really can't measure shit on the internet

484
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,140
You know, and that most of everything online where money is being

485
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,140
I was reading today in the Wall Street Journal, I was reading Facebook

486
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,140
Has revenues of had revenues last year of eight hundred million dollars

487
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,140
Eight hundred million dollars and I'm thinking of myself this can't be from people clicking on banners

488
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,140
You know, in the chat room, no Jenna chat.com, could you please raise your hand if you've ever clicked on a banner on Facebook

489
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,140
You know, she has sure there's some revenue to be made from displaying a banner

490
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,140
But really, I mean really, where is this coming from?

491
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:04,140
I mean, the way I see it, people are being forced to watch advertising and click on things

492
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,140
In order to get virtual money to play addictive games like Farmville

493
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,140
You know, I just don't see it being a really happy advertising medium

494
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,140
And is advertising really still viable the way

495
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,140
This conversation's been it's the same when we've had for the past six years nothing has changed

496
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Nothing has changed, just the deals are bigger

497
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:32,140
And there's the flow, let's put it that way, is more sophisticated

498
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
But really, how real is it? This is real

499
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,140
This, this what we're doing right here with the people

500
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,140
Feeding back in real time ideas going back and forth and value for value

501
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm really, I'm really into that and if my value is much lower than I need for my lifestyle then so be it

502
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,140
But value for value really works for me

503
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,140
And right now the value I'm getting out of just doing this show

504
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,140
And being able to share my thoughts for as far as I can share them at this moment

505
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
To be continued

506
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
It's, uh, it feels good, it really does

507
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
Let me play this one for you

508
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Now this is not for you to lean on me, but it's for me to lean on you

509
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
I'll need some of that in the next couple of weeks

510
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Classic bill where there's on this NAFU Saturday, DSC 835

511
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,140
I'll roll, roll, roll, roll if we are white

512
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,140
We know that they're always tomorrow

513
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Lean on me, when you're not strong

514
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
And I'll be your friend

515
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:25,140
I'll have you carry on for it won't be long

516
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Till I'm going to need somebody to lean on

517
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,140
Please swallow your pride

518
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:51,140
If I have faith, you need to borrow for no one can feel

519
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Don't love me on me

520
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,140
That you won't let you

521
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,140
You're just called on the brother when you need a hand

522
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,140
We all need somebody to lean on

523
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,140
I just make a problem that you understand

524
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:25,140
We all need somebody to lean on me

525
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,140
When you're not strong and I'll be your friend

526
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:42,140
I'll help you carry on for it won't be long

527
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:49,140

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Oh, yes. Here's the feeling that I want.

546
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,140
The feeling that is brewing inside me and bubbling up.

547
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
I'm free.

548
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
I'm free.

549
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,140
I'm free. I'm free.

550
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm free. I'm free.

551
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm waiting for you to follow me.

552
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,140
I told you that it takes to reach the highest high.

553
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,140
You'd love to see the things that's so good.

554
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,140
But you've been so many times before my shyness points into the door.

555
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Oh, no one had the guts to leave the temple.

556
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,140
I'm free. I'm free.

557
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,140
I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.

558
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,140
I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.

559
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:00,140
I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.

560
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I'm free

561
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,140
I'm free

562
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:33,140
And I'm waiting for you to follow me

563
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:48,140
I can't recall

564
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:59,140
I can't recall

565
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:07,140
I can't recall

566
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:13,140
I can't recall

567
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:23,140
I can't recall

568
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,140
I can't recall

569
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:37,140
Don't try to read into it, don't try to figure out the riddles, just go with the flow of the messages in the music

570
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,140
By the way, how's the microphone sounded today?

571
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,140
The gear is working so nicely, I think I can do my nails while I'm doing the show is working really well

572
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm free

573
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,140
I can't recall

574
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,140
I can't recall

575
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Don't try to read into it, don't try to figure out the riddles, just go with the flow of the messages in the music

576
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:35,140
By the way, how's the microphone sounded today?

577
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:41,140
The gear is working so nicely, I think I can do my nails while I'm doing the show is working really well

578
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:50,140
And if I stand, I'll just let them burn their eyes on you

579
00:29:50,140 --> 00:30:01,140
And if I shine, don't let it change the thing that you do

580
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,140
I can't recall

581
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Don't try to read into it, don't try to figure out the riddles, just go with the flow of the messages in the music

582
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:38,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

583

It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

628
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:55,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

629
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:02,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

630
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:08,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

631
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:16,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

632
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:22,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

633
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:29,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

634
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:37,140
It's a little bit of cowbell here for you

635
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,140
I think it was wasny I can the chat room

636
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Somehow I don't think it's the real Steve wasny

637
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,140
I requested Santana, Sambapati

638
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Oh my god

639
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,140
One last time you heard that on the radio

640
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,140
In regards to the Howard Stern interview I did the other day

641
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,140
Beginning of the week

642
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Obviously the reasons for that appearance was not to just promote anything

643
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,140
But let's be honest

644
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:17,140
If we ever want to see anything become of the new freedom that we have

645
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,140
That we essentially kind of stumbled into

646
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,140
And you know as the band with became available

647
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,140
Six, seven years ago was inevitable

648
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Inevitable that we would start broadcasting on the internet

649
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,140
I remember the very first time I saw the internet

650
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,140
And when I witnessed it when it was still a command line

651
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,140
Based we didn't have the worldwide web

652
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,140
We had something called go for and you use programs like links

653
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,140
To get the stuff and we had news groups instead of chat rooms

654
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,140
Well we had IRC actually which is still one of those things

655
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,140
It just hangs around and we're still using it today

656
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,140
The main thing was was to plant the seed of digital broadcasting

657
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Because that's really what has changed

658
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,140
When I look at the wonderful apps that have been made by people for no agenda

659
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Like pocket no agenda

660
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,140
There's at least four or five of them

661
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:12,140
There's Android apps, there's even a version of an app for the Blackberry

662
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,140
And something that I think is becoming available on Nokia phones

663
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,140
But really streaming it's everywhere you know you can listen to it in your car

664
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,140
The idea of time shifting is just beautiful

665
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,140
I mean hey we used to make mix tapes for each other

666
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,140
Remember those days you loved the girl you had a crush honor

667
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,140
You made a mix tape you know that wasn't like live stuff

668
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,140
For later was for a for enjoyment in a different scenario

669
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
All of this stuff has now come together and we can do it all

670
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,140
Of course there's there's been some significant hurdles along the way

671
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:50,140
And there still are everything I'm doing here technically is illegal by playing these songs

672
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:58,140
Now I am buying them from iTunes and essentially I'm playing them for you know a couple of my friends

673
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:07,140
That is a significant hurdle but it's a risk I'm willing to take because this is what the art is about

674
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,140
There still is an Academy of Radio Arts and Sciences

675
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,140
Art and Sciences

676
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,140
It's not just something that comes out of a computer or a playlist or a pre-programmed or done by callout research

677
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,140
It's something that has to do with the weather with feelings with mood

678
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,140
And it is digital broadcasting there's no difference how it gets to you as long as it gets to you

679
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,140
The real issue is how do you sustain it and that's when my value for value comes in

680
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Anyway, here's one that was sent in by one of the listeners one of the chuckle heads

681
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Kind of liked it it was again messaging the music big reset button in the sky

682
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,140
I think the artist is ring or ring not too sure

683
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,140
Jam though

684
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:25,140
I can remember the moment we first met

685
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,140
But you and I were as close as in your bed

686
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:38,140
We haven't worked but we'll love to face this

687
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,140
Where they were

688
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,140
The same old love we had

689
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,140
To the start of all

690
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:58,140
Can we start again

691
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,140
Do you remember the time you said you'd be in the bed?

692
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,140
What would it come to the animals and yet?

693
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:36,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

694
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Do you feel it's time to turn the page?

695
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,140
We're together

696
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,140
What if we go

697
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:58,140
Can we start again?

698
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,140
Do you remember the time you said you'd be in the bed?

699
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

700
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

701
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

702
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

703
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

704
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

705
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:49,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

706
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

707
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:59,140
We broke the same old, do you feel the stream?

708
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:43,220
I really like that.

709
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,780
The big reset button in the sky.

710
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,580
Yeah, I'm about to push that one for sure.

711
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,980
And just reading along with the chat room, no agenda chat.com, which is where the party

712
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,980
always is.

713
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,500
When we hit, I roll out the daily source code.

714
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,260
This is episode number 835, by the way.

715
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,940
As we march towards 1,000 episodes, we'll hit 900 first.

716
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,860
That's the Snapfoo Saturday edition.

717
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:09,340
It's clear to me that I haven't been really, well, I haven't been clear about my offered

718
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,340
to Howard Stern.

719
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,180
It's, of course, it's sincere offer.

720
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
It's real easy.

721
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,180
I mean, anyone can do the math.

722
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:19,700
You brought in 2 million new listeners to a serious satellite radio who pay, at the time

723
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,380
I think they were paying 12 or 13 dollars.

724
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,100
That's probably around 10 bucks or maybe you can get a, I think he's packaged in.

725
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,980
So let's say it's even 10.

726
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,260
So if you get, if you can pull those 2 million over or a million of them over and you get

727
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,740
another million from around the world, and the guy is bootlegged and pired it everywhere,

728
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,700
and people really want to hear his content, the numbers are very easy to do.

729
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,580
And you do it through an iPhone app and an Android app, and you encrypt the stream or whatever

730
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,940
you have to do so that at least there's some exclusivity for it.

731
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,980
And I think people will be more than happy to pay for it.

732
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,100
It is the value for value than I'm talking about.

733
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,100
Now, that's whatever you find valuable.

734
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,940
But really what is going on is, and this is something I did learn from Dave Weiner.

735
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,900
There's always a shift between centralization and decentralization, and right now everything

736
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:12,020
is moving away from centralized networks into smaller decentralized groups.

737
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,420
That's just the way it works.

738
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,140
This will happen to Facebook too, by the way.

739
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,300
The minute someone comes out with some kind of program or protocol or something that allows

740
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,220
you to share things with people by selection, because that's really what the private, what

741
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:29,980
people think privacy is, you know, I don't want my boss to see this picture.

742
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,580
I don't want my mom to read this particular post.

743
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,860
I want to give certain access to people, the minute that's available, everyone will shift

744
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,860
to that.

745
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,860
I mean, it always happens.

746
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,060
It always goes back and forth, and right now I think we're in a tectonic shift away

747
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,140
from centralized networks, particularly in media, and we're moving towards decentralization.

748
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,580
We have smaller groups and these are self-sustaining groups.

749
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:56,540
And then smaller groups will work together at arms length and get things done.

750
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,700
That is almost a natural law, and I'm almost 46.

751
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,780
I now can see it happening in cycles over and over again.

752
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,860
And we are becoming more dependent upon each other, not upon big networks.

753
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,140
And this is the same thing with the governments.

754
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,780
You know, the government is desperately trying to centralize everything, and people are going

755
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,060
to naturally push away from that and want to decentralize.

756
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,220
Now, of course, we're going to need guns and stuff like that to protect our decentralized

757
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,100
networks, but that's a detail.

758
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:33,020
And I can see it, it's so clear to me, and I'm very excited about it, and that's where

759
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,020
I want to be.

760
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,060
I want to be at the center of what is really happening.

761
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,180
And that's what I mean when I say I have to make choices and changes so that I can feel

762
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,180
happy.

763
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,060
Cranky, how much longer do I have to live?

764
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,300
Who the fuck knows, right?

765
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,300
I didn't want to hit that one.

766
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,300
What I meant was this one.

767
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,300
The bottom of the airways is landed, and he's sounding good to me.

768
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:04,300
This is the day he saw Scott, with Adam Curry.

769
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:13,820
It's staring at Mike.

770
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,020
Yeah, we got feet tickets to the brand bank on turnip, and it's Monday night at Pacific

771
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,020
College.

772
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,300
They're going to all the way to a few where I want to answer to the question, mainly when

773
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,300
it's hard to be rich.

774
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,300
I can just call this a simple one, right before I see what's in there.

775
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,300
Give us a ring, ding, ding.

776
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:40,300
It's a beautiful day.

777
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
Yeah, Todd, this is the last one.

778
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,300
Ring, a ding, a ding, a ding, a ding.

779
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,300
And one goes to the brand bank tickets, man.

780
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,300
What do you think?

781
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Time.

782
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,300
This is Mike.

783
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,300
I woke up again this morning with a son and my eyes on Mike.

784
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,300
Came over with a script surprise.

785
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,300
I'm my beautiful story with a twist.

786
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
I came over for you.

787
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,300
While I'm here to get your ass out of bed.

788
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,300
It's good.

789
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,300
I was waiting on the way.

790
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,300
But I didn't think nothing.

791
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,300
So we didn't know nothing.

792
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,300
And I'm sick.

793
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,300
What my hell am I?

794
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:26,300
You went drinking in a lake at any place.

795
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,300
I thought the feet are full of flavor.

796
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,300
The pain that wouldn't leave us if I didn't make it.

797
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,300
I'm the perfect one.

798
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,300
And the girls are busking up and down.

799
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,300
We're around 10 dead events again.

800
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,300
I run out of the teeth for acceptance.

801
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,300
It's just me and everything.

802
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,300
They were doing great.

803
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,300
We were working all the way.

804
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
They're right.

805
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,300
But we didn't know nothing.

806
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,300
So we didn't know nothing.

807
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,300
And I'll say, you're my hell am I?

808
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,300
You went drinking in a lake at any place.

809
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,300
But my mind, my mind, my mind.

810
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
My mind, my mind, my mind.

811
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
Yeah, I'm dead.

812
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,300
I'm in full my drinking in a lake at any place.

813
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,300
And I'm drinking in a lake at any place.

814
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
Yeah, I'm the perfect one.

815
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
So we're around 10 dead events.

816
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,300
We're so manly I want to take care of it.

817
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,300
And other men say, you're my worstie.

818
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,300
But you can say, you're my bitch, you're my the boss.

819
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,300
I'm about to find my human rights in the book.

820
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,300
And wait, time to say, which thing we got to talk about.

821
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,300
We found a good solution.

822
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,300
And I get that something.

823
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,300
So I have to want my hell am I.

824
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,300
We're bringing in a lake at 20 speed.

825
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,300
I got the feeling full on the answer.

826
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
But I'm hate and we'll be late.

827
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,300
It's the bottom of the lake at 20 speed.

828
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,300
It's the edge of the hole.

829
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
I'm going to make a hole in the hole.

830
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,300
Yeah.

831
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,300
Yeah, I'll lay.

832
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
Hell lay.

833
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,300
Hell lay.

834
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,300
Hell lay.

835
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,300
Hell lay.

836
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,300
Hell lay.

837
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,300
Hell lay.

838
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,300
Hell lay.

839
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,300
Hell lay.

840
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,300
Hell lay.

841
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,300
Hell lay.

842
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,300
Hell lay.

843
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
Hell lay.

844
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,300
Hell lay.

845
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,300
Hell lay.

846
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,300
So I have to want my hell am I.

847
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,300
We're bringing in a lake at 20 speed.

848
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
It's the right.

849
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
Am I?

850
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300
Yeah, it's my first feeling.

851
00:52:35,300 --> 00:53:00,300
I never heard of it before.

852
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,820
Yeah, exactly. I love that song. I've never heard of it before.

853
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,540
Brandven 3000 drinking in LA. Yeah, it's I dig it. It's really nice.

854
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,140
All right, I'll be honest. You caught me. I was rolling up a smoke and song ended.

855
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,820
If you're digging the songs that you're hearing on this snap-oos Saturday edition of the Daily

856
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:25,900
Source code, I recommend getting sound-hound, which I think is available for Android and the iPhone

857
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:31,900
or shazam on the iPhone and shazamming the shit out of these songs and then go buy them on iTunes.

858
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,380
That way you'll support the artist or at least the infrastructure that or artist is a part of,

859
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:44,060
which is the way it should work. And if you want to support this show and the no agenda stream,

860
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:51,260
please become a sustaining producer. You can find details of no agenda stream.com and you can

861
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:57,500
donate directly at devorac.org slash n-a-s november alpha c-era.

862
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:05,980
As I guarantee you one thing, you can buy this song on iTunes, but you will never hear it on the radio.

863
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,940
There's no way that at you.

864
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,980
These are laps this day.

865
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,940
Loading really looking for a busy evening night.

866
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:39,660
P Cocking

867
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,140
It's suggesting

868
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,540
I can't get it all air

869
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,260
It's been done to the opposite

870
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,260
Feel like I'm not in a mess of what I've had

871
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

872
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

873
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

874
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,260
I'm almost done to the opposite

875
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

876
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

877
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

878
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,260
I'm not in a mess of what I've had

879
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,260
Oh yeah

880
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:00,260
I'm a footmaid on the ground

881
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,260
I can't see them anymore

882
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,260
I'm a footmaid on the ground

883
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,260
I can't see them anymore

884
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,260
I can't see them anymore

885
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,260
I can't see them anymore

886
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,260
I can't see them anymore

887
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,260
I can't see them anymore

888
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,260
I can't see them anymore

889
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,260
I can't see them anymore

890
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,260
I can't see them anymore

891
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,260
I can't see them anymore

892
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:06,260
I can't see them anymore

893
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:36,260
I can't see them anymore

894
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,260
I can't see them anymore

895
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,260
I can't see them anymore

896
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,260
I can't see them anymore

897
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:06,260
I can't see them anymore

898
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:11,260
I can't see them anymore

899
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:16,260
I can't see them anymore

900
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:25,260
I can't see them anymore

901
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:31,260
I can't see them anymore

902
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:37,260
I can't see them anymore

903
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:06,260
Come on YouTube, let's just give these motherfuckers on

904
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,260
ד'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd'd trade

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah

906
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,700
Sheiile

907
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,860
Not not comfort than all heaven's dough

908
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,520
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

909
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,320
Oh, Yeah

910
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,300
Not not comfort than all heaven's dough

911
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:49,940
THE FAMILY

912
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,160
Oh can you still write in it

913
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:31,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

914
01:03:31,260 --> 01:04:01,260
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

915
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,080
You'd love to see it, yeah!

916
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,540
We got one for!

917
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,100
Hey, let'sK breach.

918
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,700
Hang on, okay, man.

919
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,220
No, I don't have to Matter!

920
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,100
Let's fight up with your face!

921
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,860
Whoa!

922
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,120
We went crazy!

923
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,820
No, I don't have to Matter anymore!

924
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,980
Whoo-ooooh-ee-ah-hoo!

925
01:04:35,080 --> 01:05:05,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

926
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,640
no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no one good dreams.

927
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,240
We will lead you.

928
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,120
Thank you!

929
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:24,760
Good night!

930
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,480
Greetings!

931
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:40,640
Oh, he's got one.

932
01:05:40,640 --> 01:06:07,440
and

933
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:36,080
That's a reason why you don't hear songs like that anymore on the radio and that's because

934
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:42,080
it's 13 minutes long and there would have to be at least two commercial breaks in that

935
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,080
amount of time.

936
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,680
So it's impossible.

937
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,880
And of course, if you're listening to this in the podcast version of the Digital Broadcast

938
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,280
and it's too long for you, all you have to do is just press that fast forward button

939
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,480
that's some interesting technology we invented.

940
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Eric, who's Portland?

941
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,080
Hey, Eric, did you see that story about George Allen Reckers?

942
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,960
He was currently with a male prostitute, but the guy's an anti-gay activist and he's the

943
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,960
Baptist Minister.

944
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Yeah.

945
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,960
He's a critic.

946
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,960
Remind me of that song, Missionary Man.

947
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,960
That's your rhythmic song.

948
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,960
Hey, can you spin that up for us?

949
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
Absolutely.

950
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,960
My favorite.

951
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,960
Absolutely.

952
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,960
I was born an original singer.

953
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,960
I was born from original sin.

954
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,960
And did I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done?

955
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,960
There'd be a mountain and a money pile up to my chin.

956
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:54,960
My mother told me good, my mother told me strong she said the truth to yourself

957
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,960
that it can't go wrong.

958
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,960
But there's just one thing that you must understand.

959
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,960
You can forward your brother.

960
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,960
Don't mess with a mission or a man.

961
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,960
Don't mess with a mission or a man.

962
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,960
Don't mess with a mission or a man.

963
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,960
Don't mess with a mission or a man.

964
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,960
Don't mess with a mission or a man.

965
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,960
Don't mess with a mission or a man.

966
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,960
He's got gun on the side.

967
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,960
He's got the scenes and the puzzles like enough from behind.

968
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,960
Like I looked from those five books.

969
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,960
He's a man with a mission, got a serious smile.

970
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,960
There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree.

971
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,960
The mission or a man he was following me.

972
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,960
He said stop what you're doing.

973
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,960
Get down upon your knees.

974
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,960
Have a message for you.

975
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,960
Get your head up to leave, leave, leave, leave.

976
01:08:52,960 --> 01:09:22,960
Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave

980
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:22,960
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

981
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,960
You lie right to my face

982
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,960
You spent me to believe in it

983
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,960
You said you'd rather walk away

984
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,960
Let me fall to peace

985
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,960
Because I know it would fail

986
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,960
The salty catastrophe

987
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,960
A major betrayal

988
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,960
But getting disaster

989
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,960
You're walking on water

990
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,960
Struggling long as I dream

991
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,960
And I'll give you a chance

992
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,960
From me to you

993
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,960
I'll give you a chance

994
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,960
To be free like I can see

995
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,960
In your eyes

996
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,960
And all I ever believe in

997
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
The lost in your heart

998
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,960
Feel it in my hand

999
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,960
See it in your eyes

1000
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,960
And all the times you say

1001
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,960
You tired of this place

1002
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,960
You're so sick of my face

1003
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,960
But I should wait around on you

1004
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,960
And I know that's your world show

1005
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,960
Sometimes we are just me

1006
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,960
Softens to believe

1007
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,960
Something so much more than you

1008
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,960
Something so much more

1009
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,960
Because I know it would fail

1010
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,960
The salty catastrophe

1011
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,960
A major betrayal

1012
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,960
But getting disaster

1013
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,960
You're walking on water

1014
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,960
Struggling long as I dream

1015
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,960
And I'll give you a chance

1016
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,960
From me to you

1017
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,960
I'll give you a chance

1018
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,960
From me to you

1019
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,960
I'll give you one death

1020
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,960
From me to you

1021
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,960
And I know that's your world show

1022
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,960
There's not ever lightning

1023
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,960
And all the times you say

1024
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,960
You're walking on water

1025
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,960
Can't see

1026
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:10,960
I'll give you a chance

1027
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,960
And all the times you say

1028
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,960
You're so sick of my face

1029
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,960
You're so sick of my face

1030
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,960
I'll give you a chance

1031
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:48,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1032
01:13:48,960 --> 01:14:18,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, I don't have any other, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1033
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:37,960
And all I ever need is nothing, all I feel is, I can't see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes,

1034
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:43,960
A walk you on happy day, is a walk you on happy day

1035
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,900
One last reason brought to you by Chucklehead Supreme Marcus Kauch

1036
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:58,240
in this one's by request from whom the chat room had like you'd to start spinning out some song ideas

1037
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:01,580
no agenda chat.com if you're listening on this stream beaten grab it and that for that

1038
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:37,760
I'm mad just smoking weed in the street without cops harassed, I imagine going in the court with no trap, life's down cruising blue by homo waters, no well fence supporters, more cops set away, we raise our daughters, thieves and shorter nights of colder, feeling like life is over, he's next strike like the cobra, the world's hot, my son got not, evidently as elementary, they want us all going eventually, true for now to stay more plain, knowledge of copes, come without the cops, we don't have the top dollars,

1039
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:55,240
imagine everybody flashing, fashion this on and close, lacing its click up with diamond rolls, your people told they don't go for votes, global scores, through going through a magic law at no end recovery, just a source for the mind, I take a glimpse in time watched the Flet Streep, the world has mine and I ruled worldwide, imagine that.

1040
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:06,360
I tree on my son, I looked a lionabola be that McDonnell, as if I was a gotta.

1041
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,060
If you could be mine, we both shine

1042
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,900
If I rule the world

1043
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,500
Still living for today

1044
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,740
And these last days and two

1045
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,040
Let us be paradise, like relaxing

1046
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,900
Black, latino, and Anglo-Saxon

1047
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,500
The morning it's changed the range

1048
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,240
Cast, Lord, drop us your bags

1049
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,140
Free of glass, brand new whips to craft

1050
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,860
That we laugh in the ill-a-pat

1051
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,300
The villa houses for the crew

1052
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,140
How we do, trees for breakfast

1053
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,900
Diamond sexists have been stretched

1054
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,240
So many kids of depression make me vision

1055
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,620
The better living, type of place to raise kids

1056
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,220
And opening us to the lies

1057
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:38,060
History is too fast, but I'm as wise as the whole out

1058
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,720
Plus the gold child seeing things

1059
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,540
Like I was controlling, click bowling

1060
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,980
Trick in six inches on kicks and still holding

1061
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,700
Tricks to the power, it's not civilized if he savages

1062
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,140
Give me one shot, I turn, try, fight to lavish

1063
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:51,640
Political prisoners set me free, stress free

1064
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,040
No one released, purple in the threes and jettees

1065
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,840
Fill the wind breeze and west in these

1066
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,440
I think her better sky can't make it

1067
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,320
The cities and reverse things, the williest

1068
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,720
It's sound foul whenever you roll

1069
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,440
I mean to go downtown, I don't believe

1070
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,620
I can't be selling out of consent until I feel

1071
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,620
I don't know the world, imagine that

1072
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,620
I feel like my son

1073
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,620
I love him, I love him, I don't pay that

1074
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:16,620
The act I'm in, it's yours

1075
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,620
To the beat, if you could be mine, we won't shine

1076
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,420
If I don't know the world

1077
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,940
Still living for today, it's me, it's me

1078
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,460
I want right up to my son

1079
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,700
And in hand hand

1080
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,540
We won't write up to our son

1081
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,820
We won't land land

1082
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,720
We won't write up to our son

1083
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,920
Hand in hand hand

1084
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,820
We won't write up to our son

1085
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,220
We won't land land

1086
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,900
You let it hit the story, how the thugs live and where we

1087
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,360
Duck down and car seats, heaps, man and Toby

1088
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,900
Running from the jakey

1089
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,540
I've got for pigs, he's on a break, a million states

1090
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:55,820
Go down, out of shit

1091
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,180
Wait, I had the little man, we can't be with

1092
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,180
Trying to get loose, flip the A-Stack

1093
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,620
Man and keep the gap with your cock camera

1094
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,580
Making moves and then laying a back and forth

1095
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,100
Scremmer

1096
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,700
Because you can have all the chips

1097
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,860
Be poor or rich, still nobody wanna nigger have a shit

1098
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,020
If I prove the world and everything in it

1099
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,940
Skies the limit, I push the Q45 and finish

1100
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,900
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousy's a beef felony

1101
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,140
Strictly living longevity to the destiny I thought I'd never see

1102
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,340
But reality struck, better find out before your times out

1103
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,340
But don't forget

1104
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,340
If I lose the world

1105
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:30,340
Imagine that

1106
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:33,340
I've free all my son

1107
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,340
I love them, I don't pay that

1108
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,340
Black donans' vows

1109
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:41,340
Could it be if you could be my people shy

1110
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,340
If I lose the world

1111
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,340
Still living for today and these last days of time

1112
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,340
If I lose the world

1113
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,340
I've managed to narrow

1114
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,340
I've free all my son

1115
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,340
I love them, I don't pay that

1116
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,340
Black donans' vows

1117
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,340
Could it be if you could be my people shy

1118
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,340
If I lose the world

1119
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:06,340
Still living for today and these last days of time

1120
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,340
If I lose the world

1121
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,340
If I lose the world

1122
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,340
I've free all my son

1123
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,340
I love them, I don't pay that

1124
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,340
Black donans' vows

1125
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,340
If I lose the world

1126
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,340
That's nice

1127
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,340
And Lauren Hill on the locals there

1128
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,340
If I lose the world

1129
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,340
That would be the title of

1130
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:36,340
Hey, we are well into the second hour of this Saturday

1131
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,340
Snaphoo Saturday just in the Daily Source Code

1132
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,340
It is episode 835 time for our friend from

1133
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,340
An undisclosed location in Europe

1134
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:47,340
Comic strip

1135
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,340
Comic strip

1136
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:54,340
Comic strip

1137
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,340
Comic strip

1138
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,340
Come on in my friend

1139
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,340
In the morning to you Adam

1140
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,340
No, in the morning to you

1141
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,340
Here is CSB

1142
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,340
Your impassioned eocrets funded

1143
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,340
So Adam, I must say

1144
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,340
Since early that I have nothing against

1145
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,340
Further eau enlargement

1146
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,340
And the enlargement in fact

1147
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,340
Including penis enlargement

1148
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,340
So I don't mind

1149
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,340
Terrike joining eau

1150
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,340
And in fact I want also you crane

1151
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,340
And Russia to become full eau

1152
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,340
Members

1153
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:32,340
Absolutely

1154
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,340
Well then all up

1155
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,340
Yeah

1156
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,340
Some eau countries are against

1157
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,340
So Terrike for example

1158
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:43,340
It's why I think already 30 years to join eau

1159
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,340
And now

1160
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,340
Eau is American sinister minister Robert Gates

1161
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,340
Blames eau for the latest shift in the Terrike's body

1162
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,340
I want to say only one fucking thing about it

1163
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,340
If you say once two once eau

1164
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,340
To accept the record then why the fact

1165
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:03,340
USA is not giving visa free movement to visa free

1166
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,340
With a way to

1167
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,340
To Turks

1168
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,340
Trying to say

1169
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,340
What?

1170
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,340
It's cant

1171
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:12,340
And by the way

1172
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,340
How is the Mickey doing?

1173
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,340
She's fine

1174
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,340
Squeeze her back from me

1175
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:16,340
You

1176
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,340
Sometimes I just wonder

1177
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:22,340
To the fucking comic shit blogger talking about

1178
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,340
Jack

1179
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,340
I went out through

1180
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:46,340
Right

1181
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,340
And I never went back

1182
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,340
Like a river

1183
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,340
That's all no work's wrong

1184
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:54,340
Like a fool

1185
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,340
I'll turn it and I just get wrong

1186
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:01,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1187
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:06,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1188
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:10,340
But everybody's got a hungry heart

1189
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,340
Everybody's got a heart

1190
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,340
But everybody's got a heart

1191
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,340
And a hungry heart

1192
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,340
But everybody's got a hungry heart

1193
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,340
But everybody's got a hungry heart

1194
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:23,340
And a hungry heart

1195
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,340
I only heard once two twice

1196
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,340
You had a good stop

1197
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:28,340
Falling, getting stomachs

1198
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:31,780
You fell and struggled with A sugar

1199
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,340
We took a дней as we grew to death

1200
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,340
Oh

1201
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:41,920
Now here I am

1202
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:45,340
But it's got a hungry heart

1203
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:49,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1204
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,340
Play out their money and you put your heart

1205
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1206
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:17,340
Play out their money and you put your heart

1207
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1208
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1209
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:29,340
Killing the limits of nobody says

1210
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:33,340
Nobody's like to feel the heart

1211
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:37,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1212
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:42,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1213
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:46,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1214
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:51,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1215
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:56,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1216
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:00,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1217
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:05,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1218
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1219
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:12,340
Everybody's got a hungry heart

1220
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,340
I wish it's still kind of sounded like that

1221
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,340
You know, it's just, I love that tune

1222
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,340
First spring, staying hungry heart

1223
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:21,340

Already IP, Dan Hartman on a bass

Now that missed that guy, man, what's up?

1272
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:13,340
That's the Edgar Winger group, Dan Hartman, as I said, on the fretless bass, first

1273
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,340
man he was in.

1274
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:17,340
Good friend, passed away in late 80s.

1275
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,340
Crap.

1276
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:21,340
Free ride on the daily source code and since she's back at the watch tower,

1277
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,340
it might as well play her favorite song of all time.

1278
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,340
This one's for Miss Mickey.

1279
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,340
Divinals.

1280
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:29,340
Can you do the video for me all playing the song?

1281
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,340
Yeah, oh yeah baby, show it to me man.

1282
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,340
I love myself.

1283
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,340
I want you to love me.

1284
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,340
And I feel good.

1285
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,340
I want you to love me.

1286
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,340
I search myself.

1287
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,340
I want you to find me.

1288
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,340
I forget myself.

1289
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:50,340
I want you to remind me.

1290
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:55,340
I don't know anybody else.

1291
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:59,340
But I think it feels too much to watch myself.

1292
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:04,340
I don't know anybody else.

1293
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:10,340
I don't know.

1294
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:14,340
You're the one who makes me come on in.

1295
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:18,340
You're the son who makes me shine.

1296
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:23,340
When you're in, I'm always laughing.

1297
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,340
I want to make you mine.

1298
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:31,340
I close my eyes and see you before me.

1299
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:36,340
Like I would die if you were to ignore me.

1300
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:38,340
I couldn't say just too much.

1301
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,340
I adore you.

1302
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:42,340
I can't get along with me.

1303
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,340
I do anything for you.

1304
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:50,340
I want anybody else.

1305
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:54,340
But I think it feels too much to watch myself.

1306
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:59,340
I don't know anybody else.

1307
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,340
I don't know.

1308
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,340
I'm not here.

1309
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:20,340
I love myself.

1310
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,340
I want you to love me.

1311
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:27,340
When I feel it, I'm just with all of me.

1312
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,340
I search myself.

1313
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,340
I want you to find me.

1314
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,340
I won't get my set.

1315
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,340
I want you to ignore me.

1316
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:43,340
I don't know anybody else.

1317
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:47,340
But I think it feels too much to watch myself.

1318
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:52,340
I don't know anybody else.

1319
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,340
I don't know.

1320
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,340
I want you.

1321
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,360
I don't know anyone else.

1322
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:06,360
I want you to think it feels too much to watch myself.

1323
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:13,360
I don't know anybody else.

1324
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,360
I don't know anyone else.

1325
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,320
I don't know anybody else.

1326
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,320
I don't know anybody else.

1327
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,320
But I think it feels too much to watch myself.

1328
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:42,320
Okay, babe, you can stop now.

1329
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,320
I can't even spit under the desk anymore.

1330
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:50,320
It's horrible.

1331
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,320
The vinyl's not touched myself on the snap of the saturday.

1332
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,320
It's not the deadly source code loam out for you.

1333
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,320
And now we're getting in request.

1334
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,320
Now the chat room is really heating up and starting to throw out some tunes.

1335
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:05,320
We got about 25 minutes left because Miss Mickey and I have a playday later on today.

1336
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,320
We've got some stuff to do, don't we?

1337
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:11,320
And snubbing your business, what it will be.

1338
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:15,320
So when it comes to songs that you can request, you hit my hot buttons for this one.

1339
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
Don't tip a thief for the devil.

1340
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,320
Please allow me to introduce myself.

1341
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,320
I'm a man of wealth and taste.

1342
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:30,320
I've been around for a long long years.

1343
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,320
So many amazes.

1344
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,320
So many.

1345
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:40,320
I was around when Jesus cried at his moment.

1346
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,320
So many amazes.

1347
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,320
So many amazes.

1348
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,320
So many amazes.

1349
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
So many amazes.

1350
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
So many amazes.

1351
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,320
So many amazes.

1352
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
So many amazes.

1353
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,320
So many amazes.

1354
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,320
So many amazes.

1355
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
So many amazes.

1356
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
So many amazes.

1357
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
So many amazes.

So many amazes.

1382
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,320
Hope you guessed my name!

1383
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,320
Oh yeah!

1384
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:49,320
I want buzzing you with the nature of my game!

1385
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,320

01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,320

1389
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,320
I shot it out!

1390
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,320
Who killed the candidates?

1391
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,320
Where and after all?

1392
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,320
It wasn't you ever!

1393
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,320
Let me please introduce Boba,

1394
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:17,320
I'm a man of wealth and taste!

1395
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:21,320
An island transport for those

1396
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,320
who can't kill before they reach Boba!

1397
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:30,320
This is the mint juice!

1398
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,320
Hope you guessed my name!

1399
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:35,320
Oh yeah!

1400
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:41,320
I want buzzing you with nature of my game!

1401
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,320
Oh yeah!

1402
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,320
I can't bear to clean me!

1403
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,320
Somebody saved me!

1404
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:13,320
Question what did you want to do?

1405
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,320
I want to get the candidates from Boba Doc!

1406
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
If you guys would want to leave we can go cheating!

1407
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:23,280
Uh huh huh huh!

1408
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,320
Don't you can't fight me!

1409
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,320
Oh yes!

1410
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,320
What you got in my eyes?

1411
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:35,320
The nature of my gaze

1412
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,320
Just as every encounter is a cremateur

1413
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:44,320
And all the sinners say

1414
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,320
As he tends to say, you just call me

1415
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,320
Lose a book because I've been here the sun

1416
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,320
The risk of rain

1417
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,320
So if you meet me

1418
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,320
Have some currency

1419
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
Have some sympathy

1420
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,320
Has some taste

1421
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,320
You know you're well-versed

1422
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,320
Violet him

1423
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
Or I'll nail you

1424
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,320
Soak the waste

1425
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,320
Yeah

1426
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,320
There's a me too

1427
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:16,320
Hope you get my name

1428
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,320
Yeah

1429
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,320
But what?

1430
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:24,320
What's the use of nature of my gaze

1431
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,320
Yeah

1432
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,320
Me too

1433
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,320
Get that

1434
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,320
Oh yeah

1435
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,320
Get out of there

1436
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,320
Yeah

1437
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,320
Look

1438
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,320
Come on

1439
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,320
Come on

1440
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,320
Help me

1441
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,320
Outweigh

1442
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:05,320
Help me

1443
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,320
Hand it

1444
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,320
I'm giving the Janeiro

1445
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
Outweigh

1446
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,320
I'm not

1447
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,320
Outweigh

1448
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,320
Zoe

1449
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,320
I'm going

1450
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:51,320
Simply for the demo, please give it to you for what's my name.

1451
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,320
Still a lot of the World Cup Soccer Talks going on in the chat room and origin in chat.com.

1452
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,320
And just like to point one thing out to you, like most organized sports,

1453
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,320
the thing is rigged, the game is fixed.

1454
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:06,320
Do your research, the shit is not real people.

1455
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,320
I'm telling you, they're throwing the games.

1456
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,320
It's all about money, you fools.

1457
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:19,320
Go ahead, look at the German officials from 2006.

1458
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,320
Look at the FIFA scandals. You're falling for it.

1459
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,320
It's a secret queen.

1460
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,320
It's a secret queen.

1461
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:31,320
It's a secret queen.

1462
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,320
It's a secret queen.

1463
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,320
It's a secret queen.

1464
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,320
We're now around big boys.

1465
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,320
We're around Louisiana way.

1466
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
We've been zwischening faded.

1467
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:47,320
What a Sickman queen.

1468
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,320
You're tossing up a plan, sir!

1469
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,320
We've been outside all my world,

1470
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,320
And the men glued were to get wrecked

1471
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:00,320
And, you, boy, are youhalten now?

1472
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,320
We've been provin Harry for years.

1473
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,740
It's cold, but I think it's cold

1474
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,100
And we'll see it, it's weak

1475
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,320
It's cold, but I think it's weak

1476
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,820
It's cold, but I think it's weak

1477
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:20,820
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1478
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,820
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1479
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,820
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1480
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:30,820
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1481
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:33,820
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1482
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,320
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1483
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,120
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1484
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,620
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1485
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,280
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1486
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,620
It's weak, but I think it's weak

1487
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:33,780
I just don't have no more cowbell for you.

1488
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,780
The song is over.

1489
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:39,780
What can I say?

1490
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:41,780
We're cranking it live for the hills of one star.

1491
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:45,780
It's right behind the man set up.

1492
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,780
One great day guy after another.

1493
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:51,780
It's Jimmy.

1494
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:55,780
There must be some kind of way out of here.

1495
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:59,780
Say that chocolate to the thief.

1496
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,780
There's too much confusion.

1497
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,780
I can't get no relief.

1498
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:09,780
It's the smear there.

1499
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,780
The drape are white.

1500
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:15,780
Plum and dig my earth.

1501
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:21,780
Nine will level out of nine.

1502
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,780
Nobody up it is worth.

1503
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:29,780
No reason to get excited.

1504
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:33,780
But they kind of spoke.

1505
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:39,780
They are many here.

1506
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,780
I'm longer.

1507
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:45,780
No reason to get excited.

1508
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,780
But they kind of spoke.

1509
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:51,780
They are many here.

1510
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,780
I'm longer.

1511
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:57,780
Who's through the life of this by the tone?

1512
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:01,780
But you will not be in through that.

1513
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:05,780
And this is not a fate.

1514
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:11,780
So that is the top post in hell.

1515
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,780
But I was given away.

1516
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:37,780
I was given away.

1517
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:41,780
Take that to the bank.

1518
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:47,780
The size of the show up and take advantage of people's goodwill and generosity.

1519
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:25,780
We're all along the watch tower.

1520
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:29,780
Princess kept up you.

1521
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:33,780
While all the women came and went.

1522
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:37,780
But the servants too.

1523
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:41,780
We're looking for outside in the contestant.

1524
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:45,780
So I can't get it wrong.

1525
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:49,780
To ride a small adventure.

1526
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:51,780
We can't get away.

1527
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:53,780
We can't get away.

1528
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:21,780
We can't get away.

1529
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,780
Man, this shit still sounds good.

1530
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,780
Years later, doesn't it?

1531
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:27,780
Sounds just fantastic.

1532
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:28,780
Keep away in the chat room.

1533
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,780
You want something fresh.

1534
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,780
You want something new.

1535
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:33,780
Stick this in your air bitch.

1536
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:43,780
I can't get away.

1537
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:49,780
I can't get away.

1538
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:51,780
I can't get away.

1539
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:52,780

let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look at what's going on here, let's take a look

1691
01:53:41,780 --> 01:54:06,080
it's like a kick up the pieces, that's right, well, as I said, we do about 2 hours, 1, 2, 6, 0 on the Saturday, snap through Saturday or finish with the source code

1692
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:13,200
I've got to play it, I'm going to get the hell out of it, I can't wait, I'm going to sit

1693
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:17,680
in here my job, but I've got to give you that visual, right?

1694
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:21,880
Alright, I'm going to leave you with one more song somewhere in the past eight and a half

1695
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:30,040
hundred episodes, I'm sure that we've discussed the fact that around the 30s, the musical

1696
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:38,600
scale was detuned from 432kHz, which is really the most natural fabanucci-like frequency

1697
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:42,840
range that you want, that your body wants to hear music to.

1698
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:48,440
And one of my chuckleheads out there sent me a detune version, I don't know if it's originally

1699
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:53,040
done this way, or detuned in post-production of this body rate song, and I think if you

1700
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:57,920
really just close your eyes for a second and just relax and really let the music come over

1701
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:04,920
you, you'll feel how it is absolutely affecting your entire psyche.

1702
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:50,420
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed, turn down these voices inside my head,

1703
01:55:50,420 --> 01:56:14,420
lay down with me, tell me no lies, just hold me close, don't patronize, don't patronize,

1704
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:28,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't, you can make your heart feel something

1705
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:43,420
that it won't hear in the dark, in these final hours, I will let it in my heart,

1706
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:57,420
but you won't, no you won't, cause I can't make you love me,

1707
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:26,420
if you don't, I close my eyes, that I won't see, the love you don't feel

1708
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:45,420
when you're holding me, want it will come, and I'll do what's right, just give me to that,

1709
01:57:45,420 --> 01:58:07,420
give up this fight, and I will give up this fight, cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1710
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:22,420
you can make your heart feel something that it won't hear in the dark, in these final hours,

1711
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:37,420
I will let it in my heart, but I'll feel the power, but you won't, no you won't,

1712
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:51,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1713
01:58:51,420 --> 01:59:16,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1714
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:25,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1715
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:31,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1716
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:35,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1717
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:41,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1718
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:56,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1719
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:10,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1720
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:22,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,

1721
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:37,420
cause I can't make you love me if you don't,
