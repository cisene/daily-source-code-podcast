It's the bringing here the radio

153
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
Globally

154
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,660
And we truly are worldwide, I'm the stream, no one's just stream.com.

155
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Should the track first get the wheel now?

156
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,660
It's a black Friday with fleas of shopping and strap-a-gams,

157
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,660
and these United States of Gitmo Nation, of course.

158
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,660
We are slaves who are disobedient.

159
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,660
We're not going to go out and fight with crowds.

160
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,660
We're going to hang out with the ride pods, our iPhones, our speaker systems,

161
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,660
and we're going to share some music together the way it used to play.

162
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Time to rock it up a little bit.

163
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Just a little bit of ear bleeding music.

164
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
I think we deserve that.

165
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,660
To wake up from the coma toast steak from the turkey yesterday.

166
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Now, never thought I'd feel this way.

167
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
I wanted to believe.

168
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,660
The founders are starting in their grace.

169
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
And what we've come to be.

170
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,660
The tactics act is for your freedom and civil liberties.

171
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Robert King's never reading war.

172
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
For coming by darling late.

173
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
You can fool people some of the time.

174
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
But you can't fool me.

175
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
The cost is because you can't defend itself.

176
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
So you're going to focus like me.

177
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
We'll bring it on and we prefer it straight.

178
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
And stop lies in the sea.

179
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
But be aware we know your game.

180
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
I know what you can't defend.

181
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Where do you think this will lead?

182
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Where do you think this will lead?

183
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Where do you think this will lead?

184
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Where do you think this will lead?

185
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Where do you think this will lead?

186
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,660
You like us and can't have them here.

187
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,660
Who opened your eyes and see?

188
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
I doubt to buy a group of folks.

189
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,660
A criminal's in the sea.

190
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Don't let them intimidate you.

191
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
Here is how they feed.

192
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
No matter what they throw away.

193
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,660
We must defend them and see.

194
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Where do you think this will lead?

195
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Where do you think this will lead?

196
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Where do you think this will lead?

197
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,660
They're building a kill and a shame.

198
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Where do you think this will lead?

199
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
Where do you think this will lead?

200
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Where do you think this will lead?

201
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
Where do you think this will lead?

202
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Where do you think this will lead?

203
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Where do you think this will lead?

204
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Where do you think this will lead?

205
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Where do you think this will lead?

206
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Where do you think this will lead?

207
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Where do you think this will lead?

208
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Where do you think this will lead?

209
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
Where do you think this will lead?

210
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Where do you think this will lead?

211
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Where do you think this will lead?

212
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Where do you think this will lead?

213
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,660
Where do you think this will lead?

214
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Where do you think this will lead?

215
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Where do you think this will lead?

216
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Where do you think this will lead?

217
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Where do you think this is gonna lead?

218
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Where do you think this will lead?

219
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Where do you think this will lead?

220
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Where do you think this will lead?

221
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
Somewhere spectral care is coming.

222
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,660
The moment this impacts, I think the point is the moment you have encountered.

223
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
That guess our sight out there, so will Gary.

224
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
But, how the time this image can just make Death OUT.

225
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
So, we can't control the security of axis.

226
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Everyone now knows!

227
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
It will go through the edge of the darkness of the war twice!

228
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Go through the darkness of the darkness

229
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:53,380
You know you'd almost be thinking that those guys listen to the show to the Noah

230
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,340
agenda show the sons of liberty and false flag you heard it here on the daily source code

231
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,100
where up to episode 853 near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to

232
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,700
tremble from my country corporations are in throned and corruption in high places will follow

233
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,660
the money power will prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the people until all wealth

234
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,740
is aggregated in the hands of a few and the republic is destroyed Abraham Lincoln

235
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,580
fuck yeah hey whoever went out and propagated the formula on the president Barack Obama

236
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,260
congratulations great job formula is this we go out we hit people in the mouth

237
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:44,980
yeah 12 stitches I want a little bit too literally perhaps say it with me now

238
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:56,900
I think we need something to lift our spirits something to help us get up get out of our lazy bed

239
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,780
and about the ankle seems to do the trick for me I think it's trick the fan that you find

240
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,820
in Turkey and that's the shit that makes you completely calm and cozy

241
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,900
step to baby she goes out every night to the moon on his light and she sleeps all day

242
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,020

248
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,740

249
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,780
and that's my spirit get out your lazy bed that's right and five three is the episode

250
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,180

252
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,740
hope those of you in get monation proper had similar experience had the the kid over the cup cake my

253
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,700
little cream cream sickle Christina came by and well it was just it was a complete lovely family

254
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,220
experience where she was even helping cooking she made a fantastic two layered chocolate cake

255
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,020
and I took care of all of the cooking outside of the cake for the first time I really had to

256
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:42,660
go all out and in fact I spent about 30 minutes with John after the show on Thursday discussing

257
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,860
exactly how to make candy jams and I did use his recipe with the bourbon and I'll tell you not only

258
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,820
did it work and taste great we got kind of hammered which was pretty awesome just the three of us

259
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:00,980
not bad till let's see if we can kind of awaken stretch a little bit in the full box

260
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:09,860
get me a track drop on the drop box send me the invite jams right here right now on the Charlie

261
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:42,620
where as life has a baby

262
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,580
When it's in the world, the change

263
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,980
The blame come from mine

264
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Diffin' the thing

265
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,980
And mess your soul

266
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,980
I was alive in a way

267
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
In a way, in a way

268
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,980
I was alive in a way

269
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,980
In a way, in a way

270
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Like you're right now

271
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
Like you're right now

272
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:47,980
I'm alive in a way

273
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,980
In a way, in a way

274
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,980
I was alive in a way

275
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
In a way, in a way

276
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Right in a way, in a way

277
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Right now, there is no other place I want to be

278
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Right here, right now, but you know where I go from here to here

279
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Right here, right now, there is no other place I want to be

280
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,980
I must say there's only two things that can make a dad, the happiest

281
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,980
One is when your kid says, I love this food you're cooked, can I have some more?

282
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,980
And I have to say the other one is when the kid's laughing at your jokes

283
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,980
It was happening all the once you asked today

284
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I mean, I'm on cloud nine here, I'm telling you

285
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Not only that, but wow, did you see the pictures?

286
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,980
I don't know if I think she may have put him on her Facebook or tweeted them

287
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,980
Oh boy, she got a lot of, a lot of pleasure out of me fisting the turkey

288
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,980
As she calls it, as I was jamming the stuffing deep down into the bird

289
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
It's one of these songs you can only play once a year

290
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Because the titles completely appropriated and black Friday

291
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,980
I collect everything I want, and before my friends find out of it on the road

292
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,980
When black Friday calls you know it's got to be

293
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,980
Don't let it fall

294
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Yeah

295
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,980
When you cry, cry, come

296
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,980
I fly down to my swell girl

297
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Gonna strike all the big red words

298
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
You're my little black boy

299
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Don't do just what I need

300
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Don't wear no shots in you

301
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,980
When nothing goes over me, all the time goes

302
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,980
When black Friday calls you know it's got to be on that road

303
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
You know I will

304
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Yeah

305
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,980
When black Friday calls you know it's got to be on that road

306
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,980
I'm gonna take myself a hold

307
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Gonna lay down in the middle of a set of spots on my shoulders

308
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Don't let the world pass by me

309
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Gosh, this ship don't say goodbye

310
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,980
And if you don't come, it's gonna fall

311
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,980
When black Friday calls you know it's got to be on that road

312
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Now I guess I'll take my hand

313
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,980
You know for 20 years I was not only did I not cook

314
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,980
I was not allowed to cook long story, trust me, though

315
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,980
And it's so amazing that if you just indulge me for a second

316
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
If I can tell you when we have your turkey

317
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,980
We had your mashed potatoes, your candy gums, your Brussels sprouts

318
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
You're a corn on the cob

319
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,980
All time perfectly and not a single thing

320
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Was cooked with reference to a recipe book

321
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Now my mom used to cook all the time I'll tell you

322
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,980
And when I'm in the kitchen this weird thing happens

323
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
It's like she's almost sitting on my shoulder

324
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
And she's like guiding me

325
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,980
I swear to god, I know it sounds kind of like

326
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,980
Who's out there, but it's really true

327
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,980
It's like, oh no, it's over there, sniff the spices

328
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,980
And like, yeah, I'll put some of this time, yeah, that'll be good

329
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
How about a little bit of trying the family stone

330
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Shall we all try and get that a dance to the music

331
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

332
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,980
All we need is a drama

333
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,980
But people only need a beat, yeah

334
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,980
I'm gonna add a little good talk

335
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,980
And make it easier to move your beat

336
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,980
And make it easier to move your beat

337
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,980
And make it easier to move your beat

338
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,980
You might like to hear my organ

339
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,980
I'll sit right now

340
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,980
Let me out, yeah, yeah, yeah

341
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,980
If I could hear the whole song

342
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Sit the air on the ground

343
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Yeah

344
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Isn't it me?

345
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Sit the air, call the message that's heard

346
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,980
All the square's heard

347
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:34,980
That's not opinion, that's science

348
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,980
The science is one cold, how did they do the 14-inch drama

349
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,980
It's been a great interest

350
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I've been following this open source daily source code

351
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,980
The project that the human resources had been putting together

352
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,980
It's really quite fascinating how we've wired

353
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,980
I'll say we, but they've wired Dropbox to a stream

354
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,980
I'd really like to figure out how we can have that shit automatically switch over

355
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,980
Maybe do some real programming

356
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,980
We can still repeat no agenda and daily source code

357
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,980
And then in between have all of that stuff rocket

358
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
I'm liking it

359
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,980
And then of course we need to have some more interaction

360
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
That's something I gotta do

361
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,980
I think we have come up with something amazing

362
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Go, go, kill me, Thunderbird's already dead

363
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Gotta focus on that, just come on the way

364
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Oh, look out

365
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,980
Put your white blood in the light

366
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
Everybody in this trees

367
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep

368
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
Go, Thunderbird's

369
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,980

Yeah, kind of reverberates to the entire body down to the bones, doesn't it?

513
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,180
What radio station do they play this song on?

514
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,180
Please just tell me that.

515
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,180
I've been feeling I'm not going to find very many at all.

516
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,180
Again, it's...

517
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,180
So we've got a really big figure out, is that open source Dave your source code?

518
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,180
That's where you can basically put a radio station together.

519
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,180
There was songs you'd never hear anyway, or anywhere.

520
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,180
And boy, do I love looking at these drop boxes?

521
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,180
This is from Adam Hanson's drop box, he's in Toledo, Ohio.

522
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,180
He dropped a couple of interest in tracks in.

Well, that was it, my friends, there you go.

606
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,920
That must have been 80's, right?

607
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,360
Please tell me it was a long, long time ago.

608
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,280
By the way, speaking of 80's, last night we watched a classic movie on DVD, Christine had

609
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
brought this one over.

610
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,080
It's the three heathers.

611
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,680
Oh my god, I can't believe how young they all were.

Oh man, it was like, and of course, all of a sudden, I've never seen it.

615
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,200
Remember, that's where the ultimate phrase comes from right at the beginning of the movie.

616
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,880
Ah, fuck me gently with a chain saw.

617
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,680
Brand new Michael Jackson, RIP, being raped after being killed.

618
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,280
That's the way they work with a woman that I did.

00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
It's breaking news.

620
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
Listen to the lyrics.

They're shoving it in our face, that's how arrogant these fuckers are.

622

Everybody want in my piece of Michael Jackson.

The more it's talking the more some Michael Jackson.

624

They're just when you thought he was dying.

625

He wants to give it a kid.

626
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,480

627
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
