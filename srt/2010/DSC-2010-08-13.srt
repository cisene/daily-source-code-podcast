And I love you, play us

248
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
You're a juvenile for chaos

249
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Because your face is a mess

250
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
So hide what they need

251
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I can't hide what they know

252
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
You're much more than me

253
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
You let me just jump

254
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Jump, jump

255
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Just jump, wait, don't want to go

256
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
We can't control for you

257
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
You're a juvenile for me

258
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
That you're cutting corners

259
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
And the face is a mess

260
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Ooh, face is a mess

261
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Ooh, please, I have to tell you

262
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I can't hide what they know

263
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I've been wiped in David Bowie

264
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
With rebel rebel under the resource code

265
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
The episode number is eight four one

266
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,560
I am buzzing out on a spring caffeine

267
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Nicotine and some fun

268
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Dublin pasturized stouts

269
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
I want to come along for the ride

270
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Check our hands

271
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
You walkin' up and make your eyes on me

272
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
It's looking good

273
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
I know they're just going low

274
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
I need a gun

275
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
And keep her head

276
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,560
All night long

277
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
You did a con just to see the show

278
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,560
I can't even know what you want to see

279
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
You're way as loud as we know

280
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
I can't go wrong

281
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
I want to touch him

282
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I want to be true

283
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,560
I want to make you mad

284
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,560
I'm the one that you're mad

285
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm the one that you're mad

286
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm the one that you're mad

287
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,560
I'm the one that you're mad

288
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,560
I saw you standing down by the stage

289
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
You've messed up your sadness

290
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
You're mad

291
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
It's open butter

292
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Don't want it here

293
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Say good night

294
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
You're totally younger

295
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
All the rain

296
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,560
I don't care because I like you style

297
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Don't know about your brain

298
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,560
But you look all right

299
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
I want to touch him

300
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:53,560
I want to be the one they make you mad

301
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm the one that you're mad

302
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,560
I'm the one that you're mad

303
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm the one that you're mad

304
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,560
I wanna be the one that you're mad

305
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:29,560
You're not in time, all your hands are free

306
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Yes, you're my best brother, let go of me

307
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:41,560
I know I can't stand another night, all my own

308
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Hey, come with me, let's fly

309
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Watch your name on your side, I'll do the one

310
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Watch your side, and I'll take you home

311
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Wanna touch me, wanna feel me, wanna make you mine

312
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm gonna lie down, I'm gonna fall

313
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm gonna be with you all night long

314
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm gonna lie down, I'm gonna be with you all night long

315
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,560
As for all the youngins out there thinking double rainbow is some kind of new trick

316
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
You know, back when the rainbow was the original, it is all night long

317
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
On the Charlie, we got lots of cool stuff to talk about today

318
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,560
It's been an amazing week, but first let's do one more

319
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Hold on, let's do this one

320
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm on the Elvis Hitler

321
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Then we got to talk about life and the pursuit of happiness

322
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
And this ship that was broken in 1759

323
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Man, let's get his guys, they should get that beer good a long time

324
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Here's great haves, part 1's and 2's

325
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Great, I think this is a place to make

326
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Farmed in the middle is a life for me

327
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Planned's running out so far away

328
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Gave in and just give me that country side

329
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:50,560
The stars

330
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Fresh air

331
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Time squared

332
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:10,560
The york is where I'd rather stay

333
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I can't afford to smell anything

334
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,560
I just adore a thin ice view

335
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Darling, I love you, but give me part damn a new

336
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,560
You are my wife

337
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Oh, I said, goodbye, say life

338
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Great, I go, we are the odds

339
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Great, I go, we are the odds

340
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Great, I go, we are the odds

341
00:17:50,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Bring it back, the old school sound of radio

342
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,560
To the interwebs, it's the damny source code

343
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
This is Elvis Cohen at you

344
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Green haze, Elvis Hitler

345
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Hi, checkleheads

346
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Oh my goodness, what a week it has been

347
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Everybody is perfect day for Fubar Friday

348
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,560
The Hilltop Watch Tower, Crackpot Command Center

349
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,560
The People's Republic of Southern California, located in Gipmonation West

350
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,560
And the skies are chemtrail free

351
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Yes, the only poison I'm pouring down my throat is the Guinness

352
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,560
14.9 fluid ounces, what they couldn't make it 15

353
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Coming up tomorrow in Los Angeles, Billy Eyedless Performing Live

354
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I've been invited by Bobby Eden to go to the show

355
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Now, let me tell you

356
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,560
I might have to have some drinks in the hot tub beforehand

357
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Gotta check that with the lovely Miss Mickey

358
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,560
And that needs to be celebrated

359
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
We're the bit of the punk, the original, rebel yell

360
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
On the charming

361
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,560
She said it accompanied me, but her lashes for love

362
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,560
And if it expides

363
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Grey haze, from above, because

364
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Even I know, she's probably more, more, more

365
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,560
We're the rebel yell, she's probably more, more, more

366
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Why, why, why, why, why, why

367
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
How, how, how, how

368
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
We're every year

369
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,560
How, how, how, how

370
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,560
She got a lie taken, she won't say anything

371
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Who will talk alone in she's reachy bit

372
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,560
What said can breed not wants to join me?

373
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:18,560
What's it to free I need you here by me

374
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Because in the midnight hour she comes on my own

375
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,560
With a rebel year she comes on my own

376
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,560
In the midnight hour she comes on my own

377
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,560
With a rebel year she comes on my own

378
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:50,560
A rebel year she comes on my own

379
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,560
In the midnight hour she comes on my own

380
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:02,560
In the midnight hour she comes on my own

381
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,560
With a rebel year she comes on my own

382
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,560
With a rebel year she comes on my own

383
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:54,560
By me she comes on my own

384
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,560
In the night hour she comes on my own

385
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:09,560
But it's up on the, a million times to you, to you

386
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I'd sell my soul, to you, to you

387
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Oh, I need you forever, to you, to you

388
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I give you all, I love you, baby

389
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,560
And you're so good, just like the other day

390
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,560
You've got me, it's me now, and the midnight hour

391
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,560
She's my mom, mom, mom

392
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Will her ever live, she's my mom, mom, mom

393
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,560
And the midnight hour, I'll be my mom, mom, mom

394
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Will her ever live, she's my mom, mom

395
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:10,840
I have to admit, I'm kind of looking forward to the Billie Eidler, I don't concentrate

396
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,840
tomorrow.

397
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,800
I was looking through his best-of collection, like, wow, you know, the guys had a lot

398
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
of hits.

399
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
I'm sure it's not just one of those concerts where it's like one or two songs you like,

400
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
it's going to be good.

401
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
I'm looking forward to it.

402
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm the Charlie episode number eight, four one with the Rebel Yel.

403
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,800
So this is my first week of official full unemployment.

404
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,520
Of course last week was a vacation, so that didn't exactly count and, well, we got

405
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
to talk about that, of course.

406
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,560
Since now, I am left over to your devices, to your support, and I'm going to ask you

407
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,560
a very specific way for support later on today, which will cost you no out of pocket money,

408
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
which is really easy.

409
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,760
But in general, this first week, although we see the bank account windling, I got to tell you

410
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
enough, feel good.

411
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
I sure don't.

412
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
I feel good.

413
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
I feel good.

414
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,760
I can move to the wood day day, I can't take it all out of time.

415
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,760
It's good, baby.

416
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Keeping out.

417
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Like a new to the wood day day day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,760

I feel good.

424
00:24:48,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Don't have much good, don't get down

425
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
So good

426
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760

When I hold your hand my home

429
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Then I won't change the normal role

430
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
When I hold you and my arm

431
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
And you're working through no role

432
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Then I'm gonna hold your baby and my home

433
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Then I know working through your role

434
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
And then my love won't do your job

435
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,760

436
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760

It's a tit for a tit.

543
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
It's a tit for a tit.

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
It's a tit for a tit.

549
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
It's a tit for a tit.

550
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
It's a tit for a tit.

551
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,360
It's a tit for a tit.

552
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
It's a tit for a tit.

553
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
It's a tit.

554
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
It's a tit for a tit.

555
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,360
It's a tit for a tit.

556
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360

It's a tit for a tit.

558
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
It's a tit for a tit.

559
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
It's a tit for a tit.

560
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
It's a tit for a tit.

561
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Be the water, we'll have fire, don't we see the light

562
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Everybody just drink up, come, light

563
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,160
All guys lost their fear, come, light

564
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Everybody wants to feel so tough, let it rip on me

565
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Let's subscribe to the top, yeah

566
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:07,160
You can take that to the bank

567
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Friends and the revolution pop life

568
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:36,160
I gotta tell you it's been an amazing week

569
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Pretty much started off with the Adam Corolla show, which was a very interesting to be on

570
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I'd never listened to Adam Corolla

571
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I had heard his podcast one at two times, that really my brand of humor

572
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,160
But I can totally understand how he has a, yeah, he has like his own chucklehead following there

573
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,160
And people really love his show and it's good to be on, it's kind of funky though

574
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,160
That's a weird back alley in Burbank, he's got a studio which is kind of converted into

575
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,160
I guess they're doing a television or a video version of the show

576
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,160
And they want to do that by subscription and sell it on a subscription basis

577
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Gotta try cast or set up, it was interesting

578
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Nice to be on, I was able to plug Noah gender

579
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,160
And I didn't actually talk about daily source cover, did talk about the big app show

580
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Which is what I want to talk to you guys about later on

581
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,160
In fact, I probably better do it sooner rather than later because you know me, Mr. Lightweight

582
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm halfway through my Guinness and already I'm starting to feel

583
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
I'm starting to feel no pain whatsoever

584
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,160
As the blood slowly trickles out from underneath the headphones down my cheek

585
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:48,160
I picked up about 800 900 new audience members on the big app show from that appearance

586
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,160
And it just has to be 10 times more than what it is and I've already gotten on a pretty good path

587
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't know if you've been watching today, we have Annie Duke on the show

588
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,160
And this is a little departure from the format that I've been doing of me presenting in app daily

589
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Annie Duke, of course, has made $4,5 million playing poker

590
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,160
She has a PhD in

591
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Oh, what is it?

592
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Cognitive psychology, I think

593
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,160
It's something about the way people make decisions

594
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,160
So she's very good at decision making apparently because she's doing well with this poker stuff

595
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,160
She's got a very interesting app and we kind of did the episode the episode I should say together

596
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
And I really liked the way I turned out

597
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
It was long but you know she really got into explaining the app

598
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,160
And then today in the in the hilltop watch tower crackpot command center

599
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,160
We had a black escalade with a driver out in front

600
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
As

601
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,160
WWE champion Shamus came in to do two episodes about two of the WWE apps

602
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm telling you people are catching on to this

603
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,160
You know, at least at taking it seriously, I like it

604
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
I'm really excited about it

605
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,160
And especially when you think that the WWE is actually bigger than the NBA

606
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Of course, they've got the big summer slam event coming up Sunday here in Los Angeles

607
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:09,160
But just for these guys to show up and the WWE top brass, you know, like the corporate communications guy

608
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,160
And I'm like, okay, they kind of get it and it's good

609
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
And I like that

610
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Makes me feel like I'm on the right path

611
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Again, it's got to be I got like a

612
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,160
A year 200,000 people watching the app show now

613
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,160
It's got to be 2 million before I can actually make a living off of it

614
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
But that's what you're going to help me with chocolates

615
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Later night

616
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,160
When it's dark and cold

617
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,160
I'll reach out

618
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,160
For someone to hold

619
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,160
When I'm in

620
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,160
When I'm lonely

621
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,160
She comes through

622
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,160
She's the only one who can

623
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,160
My baby grand is all I need

624
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,160
In my time

625
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,160
I've wandered everywhere

626
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Around this world

627
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,160
She would always be there

628
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,160
In a day

629
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
In a day

630
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,160
All it takes

631
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Is the power in my hands

632
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,160
In this baby grand

633
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,160
It's been good to me

634
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
But

635
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,160
All right

636
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,160
I've had friends

637
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Oh, they slept the way

638
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,160
And I've had fame

639
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,160
But it doesn't stay

640
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I've made fortunes

641
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,160
I spent the last and no more

642
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,160
As for women

643
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
They don't lost

644
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,160
With just one man

645
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
But the man

646
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Baby grand

647
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Is all I stand by me

648
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,160
They say

649
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
The one's gonna make this

650
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
On the way you want

651
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
I don't think that will lead

652
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
They said

653
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Better kind of moves

654
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
But they're not alone

655
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,160
But all this songs like these

656
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Rating on the keys

657
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Keep those memories home

658
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I've come from

659
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
From the life I've strayed

660
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,160
And I've got disguise

661
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,160
From the lives I've played in

662
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Now I'm home

663
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,160
And I'm weary

664
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,160
In a bones

665
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,160
With really one night's been

666
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Of my baby grand

667
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,160
It's coming home with me

668
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Ever since this game

669
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,160
My baby grand

670
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,160
What a great combination these two guys are, huh?

671
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Spend good to me

672
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Many Joel and Ray Charles

673
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
My baby grand

674
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Give me a little bit of music

675
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Education of the Charlie

676
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
And there's more where that came from

677
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
By the way, if you have any request

678
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Get him in now

679
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
We have a lot of requests

680
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Actually today's show

681
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
But I need some more rock and roll

682
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
So of course the chat room where the party

683
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Always is when we do this thing live

684
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
In the morning by the way

685
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Markers couch nice to see you join the party

686
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
It's a no agenda chat dot com

687
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I think we're also sitting

688
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
Of no agenda chat dot net

689
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
For some kind of security back up

690
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
The long story

691
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
So regarding the big app show

692
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
People have lots of ideas and talking

693
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
You know I appreciate all the ideas

694
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,160
But I need doers in this case not talkers

695
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
I need to get on some shows

696
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
I saw with the USA today article

697
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Yeah I picked up like 20,000 new new downloads on the app

698
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
And I was actually I was like

699
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
That's kind of interesting

700
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
USA today

701
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
It isn't what it used to be that kind of exposure

702
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
I think there's

703
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
There's you know it's really got to come from viral

704
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,160
And online and people posting and making blog posts

705
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
And yeah I'd love to be on Twitter

706
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Leo used to

707
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Invite me on I don't know what happened

708
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Face it I don't think he's going to have me back on

709
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
It would be the perfect place to go and promote the

710
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
The big app show

711
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
I don't know what it is

712
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I think it's make maybe he feels like a stole

713
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
John C to Voraq from him or something like that

714
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
I'm not quite sure

715
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
I have no I harbor no grudge

716
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Against the guy

717
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
I would be great

718
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
I'd love to be on that show

719
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Any other show where people are checking in

720
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Who would like gadgets and stuff

721
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
That's where I've got to be

722
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
So that's the only support

723
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
I'm requesting on today's daily source code

724
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
That's the kind of support I need

725
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Because

726
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
I'll shoot at the big app show

727
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
If we had 2 million people watching

728
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
Then I wouldn't need to ask for money

729
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Ever then you know I could actually

730
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Like

731
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Buy new shirts

732
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
But don't feel bad for me just yet

733
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
I'll tell you when it really gets bad

734
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
This one is viral

735
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
I guess it came through on Twitter

736
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
It's been Floyd's money

737
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
My name

738
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
The good way

739
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Baby, tell me

740
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Don't pay your okay

741
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,160
My name

742
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,160
It's a gift

743
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Grab that candy

744
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Both hands that make a touch

745
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
You got to be our boss

746
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Baby, tell me

747
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Don't pay your okay

748
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
My name

749
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Get back

750
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,160
I'll hold my jacket

751
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Hands off my side

752
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
My name

753
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,160
It's a gift

754
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I don't need

755
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,160
That's good good bullshit

756
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,160
I'm in the 5th of the day

757
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
But it's cross-drowning

758
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Sector's heart

759
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Baby, tell me the lyrics

760
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Team 1, search and rescue team

761
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
If we just need that

762
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
I don't want to send money

763
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
It's a water

764
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
And just a suggestion

765
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
I don't want to send money

766
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,160
I don't want to send money

848
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
I don't want to send money

849
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
I don't want to send money

850
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I don't want to send money

851
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,160

I don't want to send money

855
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
I don't want to send money

856
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:35,760
Yeah, absolutely. I certainly wasn't right.

857
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:58,480
All right, once the last time you heard the song all the way through to that bid on the radio, huh?

858
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,800
I don't think so. By the way, here's a little trivia test for you. What is that sound?

859
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,520
I didn't know they put them in the cans. That is the, uh, what do they call that thing?

860
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,040
They call it the bullet or something home. Me, uh, there must be something on the can about that.

861
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:22,000
Uh, or though, yeah, I think they call it the bullet. Let me see. It doesn't say anything. Why don't they mention that on the can?

862
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,920
I know they put it in their bottles. Hmm. Well, anyway, when you hear that sound, that means the can of Guinness is emptied,

863
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,920
then that means it's time to open up a new one. And time to roll out.

864
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,640
Ray on the Charlie.

865
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,200
Adam, it's great to see you and your family doing fine.

866
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,160
If he's trying to become a Baltimore girl with anger management problems,

867
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,440
you thought a Christina is going to be a star on a real life, so.

868
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
No, always with us, daughter.

869
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,680
And you became the admin.

870
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,480
That man. Yeah, I like it. Yeah.

871
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,120
I need that tune. Jeff Smith, where are you?

872
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,000
That's cool.

873
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:26,640
I don't agree with your close one door to open another theory.

874
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,000
I mean, in my situation, I have to pay my rent every month. I like to drag my car.

875
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,080
And all the other things I do with my salary now, if I stop doing what I hate,

876
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,720
I probably could go on for another two years. But then, I mean, if I don't have anything new,

877
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,880
I've got big problems. Who's going to pay my rent? I wish your theory was right. But that would mean that

878
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,080
everybody could do what they want with some ideal world.

879
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,040
I mean, you didn't stop working for me,

880
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,280
you know, before you created something new, isn't it?

881
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,360
I don't have a safety box.

882
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,880
I believe that freedom is something that's between your ears.

883
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,680
Even though you've got to do things, you don't like.

884
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,080
That could be your daily job or maybe visiting your mother-in-law.

885
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,320
You can create happiness and freedom for yourself and with yourself.

886
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,520
So, Mr. Epman. Epman.

887
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,200
It's great to see you're doing fine. And I would like to play a song for you.

888
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,400
Hi, you're my name.

889
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,760
Hi, I'm Kori.

890
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,160
The soundtrack to my life.

891
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,440
So, because you're playing all the big rocking tracks,

892
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,240
I've got to do something else, something hokier, maybe something Dutch, or maybe a soundtrack to your life.

893
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,720
Okay.

894
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,200
Let me think.

895
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,760
Well, let's take two out of three.

896
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,400
A song from 1976.

897
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,880
You were 12 years old, living in the nest on the Omsol near Amsterdam.

898
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
And this girl was hot. She was the shit.

899
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,120
Great time.

900
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,400
No, we're young and local.

901
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,560
You do, you do.

902
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,800
But who wish you all a very nice weekend?

903
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,440
Yeah!

904
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,400
Bye, bye now.

905
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,320
I've been waiting for you.

906
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,320
I've been waiting for you.

907
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,320
I've been waiting for you.

908
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,320
I've been waiting for you.

909
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,320
I've been waiting for you.

910
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
I've been waiting for you.

911
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
I've been waiting for you.

912
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
I've been waiting for you.

913
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,320
Bye, I've been waiting for you.

914
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,600
I've been waiting for you.

915
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
I've been waiting for you.

916
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,200
That's what our love is.

917
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,840
That's what our love is.

918
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,720
And each of us is good.

919
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,560
I've been waiting for you.

920
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,560
Oh, he isn't peasant and me

921
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,560
And I won't love each other's hair

922
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,560
I hate you

923
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,560
I hate you

924
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,560
I hate you

925
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,920
but... so far

926
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,560
If I didn't hit any guy

927
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,560
Then I lifted the表

928
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
but it does

929
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,560
It does

930
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,560
It does

931
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,560
And then it's good

932
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:36,560

958
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,780
does old school radio in a new form of distribution which really has just been

959
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,100
lost with the roll ups of clear chant I mean who listens the radio anymore how

960
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:47,180
can you listen to that crap process one DJ for five markets is impossible I've

961
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:51,380
got one market and that's the people who are listening to the daily source code and

962
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,980
primarily when we do the live shows are in the chat room in no agenda chat dot net

963
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,740
and no agenda chat dot com and I love it when people are listening and they say oh

964
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,980
you know I I think we should play this song next and of course used to be it

965
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,820
have to run over to the record library get one of those vinyls and go grab it

966
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:12,860
and bring it back and cue it up and these days just flip over to iTunes pay my

967
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:20,780
dollar twenty nine and there you go this by the way is the full length version which

968
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,580
is another little secret we have here on the Charlie you don't hear these songs

969
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:33,580
on the radio then Lizzie's whisky in the jar

970
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,760

971
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:02,580
And I brought it up all the time

972
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,580
Just want that chance of me

973
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,580
Now I'm with you, man

974
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,580
For the devil take that bomb

975
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,580
For your nose, your treat me easy

976
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,580
But your ring, you're not into my die

977
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,580
Wicked for my dead hero

978
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,580
Wicked for my dead hero

979
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,580
Then a twist here on the jaw

980
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,580
Wicked for my dead hero

981
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,580
Then a twist here on the jaw

982
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,580
Wicked for my dead hero

983
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,580
Then a twist here on the jaw

984
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,580
Wicked for my dead hero

985
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,580
Then a twist here on the jaw

986
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,580
Wicked for my dead hero

987
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,580
Wicked for my dead hero

988
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,580
Then a twist here on the jaw

989
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,580
Wicked for my dead hero

990
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,580
Wicked for my dead hero

991
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,580
Then a twist here on the jaw

992
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,580
Wicked for my dead!

993
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,580
I brought it up all the time

994
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,580
It's K.Z.

995
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,580
Take it my mom your weapon

996
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,580
And I brought it up all the time

997
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:54,580
All the danger, for that sex I've never said

998
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:02,580
If I can't defend, I'm just a part of my principles

999
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:06,580
And I share them with both their loved ones

1000
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,580
But I'm sure they don't want to die

1001
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:17,580
Wake up, I'll be over, wake up, I'll be over

1002
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,580
They'll let you in the job

1003
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:26,580
Wake up, I'll be over, wake up, let you in the job

1004
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,580
Now so they laugh with vision

1005
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,580
Let's love them like a fine family

1006
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,580
So then Unexpected, again

1007
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:52,580
I can't move, I can't move

1008
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:59,580
Me Alexton, especially at my modest chamber

1009
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,580
But he I am your friend

1010
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,580
He I am with a bolder cheeky

1011
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:11,580
Mucher wing than I think I'm a dad

1012
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,580
But I'm a dad, you know

1013
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,580
With a bolder cheeky

1014
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,580
That I should feel the charm

1015
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,580
I can't move, I can't move

1016
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,580
I can't move, I can't move

1017
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,580
I can't move, I can't move

1018
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,580
I can't move, I can't move

1019
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,580
I can't move

1020
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,580
I can't move

1021
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,580
Yeah, that's what we call classic

1022
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,580
Absolutely classic, then Lizzy whiskey in the jar

To Miss Mickey

1027
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:04,580
She is as we speak at a very important audition

1028
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,580
For a co-starring role in TV series

1029
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,580
And I can feel it right now, she is doing it as we speak

1030
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,580
So would you all just do me a favor?

1031
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,580
And just put your hand on your iPod, your iPhone

1032
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,580
Your MP3 player, your pooder

1033
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,580
Whatever it is, just tend to some good karma, tend to some vibes

1034
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,580
Thank you

1035
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,580

1036
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,580

1037
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,580
You know how it went

1038
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,580
Are we all still feeling free

1039
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,580

1040
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:43,580
Fish David and she's still in the street

1041
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,580
Smile and call my heart to her

1042
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,580
I said hey hey

1043
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,580
What do you think I'm baby

1044
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,580
Maybe maybe she's in me

1045
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,580
I'll be here

1046
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,580
I said hey

1047
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,580
What's my name, baby

1048
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,580
Maybe we can see that we're safe

1049
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,580
Now don't you hate

1050
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,580
I said let's move

1051
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,580
Before the days are broken

1052
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,580
Out

1053
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,580
All right now

1054
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:19,580
Baby, it's all right now

1055
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,580
All right now

1056
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,580
Baby, it's all right now

1057
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,580
All right now

1058
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,580
Let me tell you now

1059
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,580
I took her home

1060
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,580
For my best

1061
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:45,580
Watching every new one of this

1062
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,580
She said look

1063
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,580
What's your opinion, baby

1064
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:53,580
I've been trying to put her in shame

1065
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,580
I said let's go

1066
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,580
But go to bed

1067
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,580
Don't want you to be alone

1068
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,580
She said let

1069
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,580
I said let's move

1070
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,580
Before the days are broken

1071
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,580
Out

1072
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,580

1073
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:17,580
Baby, it's all right now

01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,580
All right now

1075
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,580

All right now

1106
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,580
All right now

1107
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,580
All right now

01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,580
All right now

1109
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,580
All right now

1110
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,580
All right now

1111
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:28,580
All right now

1112
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,580
All right now

1113
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,580
All right now

1114
01:05:31,580 --> 01:06:01,580
All right, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1115
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,900
I'm still looking for an extra stand for the cowbell here on the, the service code Hiltowwatch, ThauerCry Pocket,

1116
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:14,100
command center studios. This would also be a request as we start to roll into that portion of the

1117
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:18,040
show we'll pass an hour, so you might as well, hit it!

1118
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,580
Rain the power inside

1119
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,580
It's something

1120
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,580
Everybody's in the left

1121
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,580
And don't you know

1122
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,580
It's a beautiful day

1123
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,580
Hey

1124
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,580
We're in the valley of new

1125
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,580
And we have a sunshine right

1126
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,580
And a city

1127
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,580
All the streets where once was built

1128
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,580
It's the blue

1129
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:02,580
Time is living in the next day

1130
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,580
The stupmus life is the last one

1131
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:13,580
You had to find the way for solours

1132
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,580
The stupmus life is the last one

1133
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:25,580
You had to find the way for solours

1134
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:45,580
And you went to bed at the base

1135
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,580
Welcome to the human race

1136
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:54,580
The celebration is the blue skies of the way that I'm today

1137
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,580
This is the day we waited for

1138
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:02,580
Oh, Mr. Bush on, Mr. Bush, why?

1139
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:10,580
You had to pay for so long, so long, so long, so long

1140
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:15,580
Hey, Mr. Bush, I'm pleased to be with you

1141
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:18,580
Look around, see what you know

1142
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:23,580
Hey, Mr. Bush, I'm pleased to be with you

1143
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:26,580
Yes, I'm pleased to be with you

1144
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:29,580
Look around, see what you know

1145
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,580
Hey, Mr. Bush, I'm pleased to be with you

1146
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,580
Look around, see what you know

1147
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,580
Hey, Mr. Bush, why?

1148
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:43,580
You had to pay for so long, so long

1149
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:49,580
Hey, Mr. Bush, I'm pleased to be with you

1150
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:53,580
Who's the one you're right?

1151
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:56,580
What's so confused all night?

1152
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:00,580
Good for no one, now is happiness on your shoulder

1153
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,580
Never mind, I'll remember you, miss me

1154
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,580
I'll remember you, miss me

1155
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,580
This way, it's the first time

1156
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:13,580
Tell us why, we're not too high, we're so low

1157
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,580
We're not too low, we're not too low

1158
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stay left, sky

1159
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,080
So please do be with your sky

1160
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,580
Don't go around, see why, you're beautiful

1161
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,580
Everybody smiles at you

1162
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:51,580
You know, not many people really remember the story of Eolo electric light orchestra.

1163
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,580
They were, of course, top of the bill.

1164
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,580
No one could beat these guys down.

1165
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:58,580
And they had lots of tape loops on stage.

1166
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:00,580
These are the days before synthesizers.

1167
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,580
They were using actual tape recorders with loops.

1168
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,580
And I think what happened is during a live concert,

1169
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,580
something got unplugged or something got messed up.

1170
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,580
And as the tape loops screwed up.

1171
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,580
And then all of a sudden, they were like,

1172
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,580
Oh, these guys aren't for real.

1173
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,580
They're using tape loops.

1174
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,580
It's a horrible thing.

1175
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,580
Screw these guys.

1176
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,580
And that really made it.

1177
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:25,580
Of course, Jeff Lynn, one of the most outstanding songwriters,

1178
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,580
producers and musicians of our time.

1179
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,580
And the proof is in the pudding right there.

1180
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,580
And of course, these days, you know,

1181
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,580
we don't think twice about auto tune.

1182
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,580
Oh, well.

1183
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,580
That's how it goes in popular culture.

1184
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,580
The question is,

1185
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:42,580
Do you want me or do I want you?

1186
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:46,580
I want you to want me.

1187
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,580
You need me.

1188
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:19,580
I don't need you, I'll need you.

1189
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:24,580
I'll make you to make me.

1190
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:29,580
I want you to want me.

1191
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:33,580
I need you to need me.

1192
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:38,580
I don't need you to know me.

1193
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,580
I don't need you to know me.

1194
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,580
I don't need you to know me.

1195
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,580
I don't need you to know me.

1196
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,580
I don't need you to know me.

1197
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,580
I don't need you to know me.

1198
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,580
I don't need you to know me.

1199
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,580
I don't need you to know me.

1200
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:03,580
I don't need you to know me.

1201
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:07,580
I don't need you to know me.

1202
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:13,580
I don't need you to know me.

1203
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,580
You need me.

1204
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,580
I don't need you to know me.

1205
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:24,580
I don't need you to be.

1206
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,580
I don't need you to make me.

1207
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,580
I don't need you to know me.

1208
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,580
I don't need you to know me.

1209
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,580
I don't need you to know me.

1210
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,580
I don't need you to know me.

1211
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,580
Let's not be

1212
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:43,580
Do you think that he left in a secret?

1213
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:48,580
Oh, do you think that he left in a secret?

1214
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:52,580
Do you think that he left in a secret?

1215
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:57,580
Oh, do you think that he left in a secret?

1216
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:11,580
He's not allowed to spend a night feeling like dying

1217
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,580
Oh, do you think that he left in a secret?

1218
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,580
He's born in a secret?

1219
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,580
Oh, do you think that he left in a secret?

1220
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,580
Oh, do you think that he left in a secret?

1221
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:42,580
Oh, do you think that he left in a secret?

1222
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:48,580
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on

1223
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:52,580
Come on, come on

1224
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:58,580
Come on, come on

1225
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:02,580
I won't give one

1226
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,580
Jake Frank, I want you to run me

1227
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,580
Live in buttercon

1228
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,580
And on your food by Friday

1229
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,580
Freak out the festival

1230
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,580
Might as well keep it rolling all right

1231
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,580
Keep it kind of like sixty's five

1232
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,580
This I think is an interesting choice of song

1233
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,580
Limers to fill colors

1234
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,580
Hainted in the United Kingdom

1235
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,580
Loved in the United States

1236
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,580
And a door in the international lands

1237
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,580
As he holds on mark the reason of it out

1238
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,580
And then he way

1239
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,580
When I went home

1240
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,580
We saw the inside

1241
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:56,580
As I started to dance

1242
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:01,580
Thebouce�로 flying away

1243
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:04,580
Why didn't you hear this song?

1244
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,580
Call for blocks

1245
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:11,580
Who's going to run me away

1246
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,580
amentos on her head

1247
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,580
Search for me apart

1248
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:19,580
When I am sick of the burning

1249
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,580
Who's so close to you?

1250
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:51,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1251
01:16:51,580 --> 01:17:21,580
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

1252
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:51,540
I always thought the song was perfect though, remake, right?

1253
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:57,700
So far as your love is like a gateway, and I would be remiss, but I think my excellent

1254
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,620
host role we were in one hour in the Netherlands and till these last week, Lex, thank you so much

1255
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:07,980
for opening up your home to us and allowing us to hang out and smoke in it for merely.

1256
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,300
Without pitching once about that, that was pretty awesome.

1257
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:17,980
And of course, our buddy Juan there, I cannot wait to be back in the lovely, out into

1258
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:21,060
the diverse parish, no less.

1259
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,900
So is it an image?

1260
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:27,140
Oh, no, you did a scene and then is I?

1261
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:34,980
Oh, no, you make me believe it, you were a no, she's being Russian so, she's getting

1262
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,980
that's why it is.

1263
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,980
Oh, yeah, I was an in his face.

1264
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,980
Oh, no, it's just a child is one in place.

1265
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:48,980
Oh, no, that's just a song, if you want to know, she'll feel Russian so, she's

1266
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:49,980
in his kid.

1267
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,980
That's why it is.

1268
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,980
Oh, it's in his kid.

1269
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:54,980
That's why it is.

1270
01:18:54,980 --> 01:19:04,980
Oh, can we have a poem and spend it in time and find out what you want to know?

1271
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:10,980
Oh, it's no, if it really is, yes, there it is, kids.

1272
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:20,980
Oh, no, that's just a way and you're not listening to what I say, if you want to know,

1273
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:24,980
she'll feel Russian so, she's in his kid.

1274
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,980
That's why it is.

1275
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:28,980
Oh, yeah, I was an in his kid.

1276
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:29,980
That's why it is.

1277
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:55,980
Oh, can we have a poem and spend it in time and find out what you want to know?

1278
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:01,980
Oh, it's no, if it really is, yes, there it is, kids.

1279
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:09,980
Oh, that's just a way and you're not listening to what I say, if you want to know,

1280
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:19,980
she'll feel Russian so, she's in his kid.

1281
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:20,980
Oh, yeah, yes, there it is.

1282
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,980
A bit of music education for you on the Charlie Betty Everett.

1283
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:28,980
It's in his kiss pretty much a whole time pirate radio favorite from the days.

1284
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,980
They were still out there on the ships.

1285
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:34,980
I got to tell you it was so awesome being in Bonère, this big like open house.

1286
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,980
The kitchen was open, the whole living room, the dining room all open.

1287
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:41,980
And I actually cooked a couple of times, which is a lot of fun.

1288
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,980
And I cooked a whole chicken.

1289
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:49,980
That was a quite, quite task, I must say, but throughout the entire experience,

1290
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:53,980
I had daily source code eight, four, zero rolling.

1291
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:54,980
And it was cool.

1292
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,980
You know, I had a new audience, only two.

1293
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,980
Lex and Juan.

1294
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,980
But I know I saw him like looking around and saying, hey, what can we get?

1295
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,980
Can we subscribe to this thing?

1296
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,980
By the way, there is a daily source code.

1297
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,980
And of course, you can all subscribe to it in iTunes.

1298
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,980
And what we do once a week, at least.

1299
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,980
And this of course, been a really busy one.

1300
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,980
Otherwise, it tried to roll out too.

1301
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,980
As we get together, we get together.

1302
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,980
No agenda stream.com, where the show blasts out live.

1303
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,980
And a no agenda chat.com, no agenda chat.net.

1304
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:30,980
And we just play cool songs and kind of chill out.

1305
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:32,980
And today I'm drinking Guinness.

1306
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,980
Can number two.

1307
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:38,980
Hey, it's a big day for me.

1308
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,980
It's not really cool.

1309
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:45,980
It's one of the songs that I had on my soundhound tagless.

1310
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,980
Heard it somewhere in a restaurant.

1311
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,980
I was like, oh, yeah, baby, got to go old.

1312
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,980
I've got to play this on the Charlie for my friends who are listening to the show.

1313
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:56,980
While we're talking in the chat, remember this and all is so slow.

1314
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,980
If you're so good.

1315
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:00,980
This will be everlasting though.

1316
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:01,980
This will be.

1317
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,980
If the one I've waited for, this will be.

1318
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,980
If the first time anyone else of me in here.

1319
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1320
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,980
I'm so glad.

1321
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,980
It's out in the sand.

1322
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,980
And I'm so glad that it's back in my life.

1323
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:21,980
This will be.

1324
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:24,980
And everlasting love for me.

1325
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1326
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,980
It's a kind of wonderful

1327
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,980
It calls you show me

1328
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,980
Just how much you care

1329
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,980
You give it to me

1330
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,980
The thrill of a lifetime

1331
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,980
And maybe, maybe, you've got more frills to smell

1332
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,980
This will be

1333
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:47,980
Hey, our last love

1334
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,980
I'll be answered with that

1335
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,980
You've got a lot of sunshine

1336
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,980
Into my life

1337
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,980
This will never have an answer

1338
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,980
Never gonna do

1339
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,980
You gave me more joy than I

1340
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,980
Ever dreamed of

1341
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,980
And no one

1342
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,980
Don't want to take the legs

1343
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:09,980
That you do well

1344
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,980
This will be

1345
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,980
You and me

1346
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:14,980
Yes, I'll be

1347
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,980
It's a little mean

1348
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:17,980
Kind of a squeeze

1349
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,980
And I can't turn and please

1350
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:19,980
I took it before

1351
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,980
I ever threw it away

1352
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:21,980
Whatever

1353
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:22,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1354
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,980
It will be you and me

1355
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,980
So round and round

1356
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:26,980
I'll be given to you

1357
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,420
Don't take youabe

1358
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:46,980
Oh

1359
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:47,980
Oh

1360
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,980
Oh

1361
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:57,980
She's done a lot of really big hit songs, but this is my favorite by Natalie Cole,

1362
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:04,980
the first daughter of the infamous Nat King Code. This will be the everlasting love on April 1.

1363
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,980
How many of you have counted? Let us first go. We are Friday.

1364
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:15,980
All right, so when I did the shout out on the Twitter that requests were welcome before I started the show.

1365
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:24,980
This one came in and I thought, you know, it's so hokey. It's so wide. It's so gay.

1366
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:29,980
It just might work. Wait a minute. Don't tell me some fucking karaoke version.

1367
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,980
Please tell me it's the real version. Hold on a second.

1368
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:38,980
No, that sounds good. There you go. Now I recognize it. Oh, what's some cowbell might do nice in this.

1369
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:56,980
The name was roll up. She was a sugar with yellow feathers in her hair and it goes cut down.

1370
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:03,980
And as she went my ring, and to the chacha, I want you try to be a star.

1371
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:11,980
Tony always didn't borrow across the cloud and floor. They were from 184. They were young and they had each other.

1372
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:17,980
Who could have come more at the co-pop, co-pop, co-pop banner?

1373
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:26,980
The hardest but no-so-pop banner. Here at the co-pop, co-pop banner.

1374
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:37,980

1457
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,100
One lady in the chat room in Nojana chat.com

1458
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,320
So I do want to call her out and a groupie is

Hangin out and she's always taking a lot of abuse

All the guys who are apparently fans of this show and of Nojana

I know

1466
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,460
It would be

1467
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:46,540
But change my grace guys to look

1468
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,940
And it was strange

1469
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,940
When you call my name

1470
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:58,220
Ever since that day I haven't been the same

1471
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,620

I was like a sun

1476
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,620
A set of keys

1477
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:50,620
Then you can give my soul a melody

1478
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,620
Thanks to you

1479
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:56,620

It's a short time

1491
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:32,620

1504
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,620
It's still you

1505
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,620
I've sent out the chance

1506
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,620
But I've let you my son

1516
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,600
sound howng got confused and then it couldn't figure it out. And then finally it

1517
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:06,000
figures it out at this moment. Have not heard this song in ages. In fact, I

1518
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,240
didn't even play it after I got it for my tunes, so I wanted to make sure I

1519

shared the experience of hearing this song again with you guys.

1520
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:23,040
What did you think? I would do at this moment. When you stand and

01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:36,540
be for me with tears in your eyes trying to tell me that you have found you

1522
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:58,420
and nothing you just don't love me no more but did you think? I would say at this

1523
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:11,980
moment. When I'm faced with the knowledge that you just don't love me, did you think I would curse

1524
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:27,860
you? I would say things to hurt you, but you just don't love me no more. Did you think I would hate

1525
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:50,460
you? Or raise my hands to you? I come on, you know me too well. I feel like I hurt you with darling, I love you and

1526
01:39:50,460 --> 01:40:08,620
you know. I'd never hurt you. Do you think I would give at this moment? If you'd stay

1527
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:23,420
out so tragic when the end of my life, I'd fall down on my knees, kiss the ground that you walk on.

1528
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:52,020
If I could just hold you again, I'd fall down on my knees, kiss the ground that you walk on baby.

1529
01:40:52,020 --> 01:41:08,340
If I could just hold you again, I'd fall down on my knees, kiss the ground that you walk on baby

1530
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:12,340
Come on, Billy. Take it all away up there.

1531
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:59,340
I don't think I ever made a song that equal this one. Damn, this is good. Billy Barron, the

1532
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:12,340
song that I've always had at this moment. One of the things we used to do back in the old school days of radio,

1533
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:17,340
you know, when it wasn't a process and playlisted and computerized and crap well, of course,

1534
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:25,340
computerized there, because all the songs are computerized, but you know, you could kind of determine what you wanted to play yourself and you had like a show and not just a portion of a daily playlist.

1535
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:33,340
You know that that special girl would be out there listening, driving through the hills of Los Angeles and her Range Rover.

1536
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:41,340
From 1999, listening to me on her iPhone 4 and like, yeah, I think I'll play a song for you, baby.

1537
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:14,340
Once it's never in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time. I can never get in love with a man like you,

1538
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:19,340
do that to me one more time.

1539
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:39,340
I can never get in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1540
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:50,340
As if I may want more time, once just isn't in love for my heart to hear,

1541
01:43:50,340 --> 01:44:02,340
but tell it to me one more time. I can never hear in love while I got to know,

1542
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:12,340
say those words of you, like you just need,

1543
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,340
would be me,

1544
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:21,340
tell it to me one more time.

1545
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:42,340
I can never get in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1546
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:53,340
I can never get in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1547
01:44:53,340 --> 01:45:20,340
Do that to me one more time, once just isn't in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1548
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:33,340
I can never get in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1549
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:48,340
I can never get in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1550
01:45:48,340 --> 01:46:06,340
Do that to me one more time, once just isn't in love with a man like you, do that to me one more time.

1551
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:17,340
Do that to me one more time, do that to me one more time.

1552
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:23,340
I totally agree with you Martin J. J. Why don't they make music like this anymore?

1553
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:29,340
Well you know it because it's considered gay to play music like this. That's why people laugh at you.

1554
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:33,340
But you know, you bore a Guinness in a half and me and I got no problem with that.

1555
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:41,340
The captain intonial do that to me one more time and while we're in kind of that romantic vibe, we might as well play one more only just once a little bit earlier in time in the 60s.

1556
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:47,340
The association and never mind love.

1557
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:57,340
You asked me to let them come a time when I will die with you.

1558
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:02,340
Never mind love.

1559
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:08,340
Never mind love.

1560
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:21,340
You wonder if it's a normal life, but if it's just a home for you, never mind love.

1561
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:27,340
Never mind love.

1562
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:32,340

Never mind love.

1570
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:15,340
You say you fear I'll change my mind that I won't require you.

1571
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:21,340
Never mind love.

1572
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:26,340
Never mind love.

1573
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:37,340
How can you think love will end when I rescue you just then you're home alive?

1574
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:47,340
Never mind love.

1575
01:48:47,340 --> 01:49:01,340

So maybe you have heard this, but let me remind it.

1689
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,340
A quote.

1690
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:57,340
C.S.B.

1691
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:00,340
Were you naked when you recorded this?

1692
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:03,340
They came first for the communists.

1693
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:07,340
And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist.

1694
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:10,340
Then they came for the trade unionists.

1695
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:14,340
And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.

1696
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:18,340
Then they came for the Jews.

1697
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:21,340
And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.

1698
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:25,340
Yeah, you're doing a take off on a very old one here.

1699
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,340
And then they came for me.

1700
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:30,340
And by the time, no one was left.

1701
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:32,340
To speak up.

1702
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:36,340
And they came for the communists who bloggers and they took them all away.

1703
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:43,340
So I wanted to talk about the situation with gypsies with the Roma in now in France.

1704
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:47,340
Previously in Italy and also recently in Denmark.

1705
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:53,340
The EU citizens are being expelled from EU countries despite the freedom of movement.

1706
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,340
Ah, hold on a second.

1707
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:58,340
So yes, be before you even continue for one second.

1708
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:59,340
There's no freedom.

1709
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:00,340
Not in the EU.

1710
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:02,340
Not since the list been treated my friend.

1711
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:06,340
Vagrants will get arrested, kicked out, put in jail.

1712
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:13,340
Accused being out of sound, mind, alcoholics and or addicted to illegal substances.

1713
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:15,340
It's all in the protocols.

1714
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:17,340
That's what you all signed off on.

1715
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,340
Fools.

1716
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:21,340
And the European Commission is doing nothing.

1717
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:22,340
No, they're encouraging it.

1718
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:32,340
Just saying that okay, every country has a right to expel people who are committing crime or a danger to public order.

1719
02:03:32,340 --> 02:03:34,340
But this is a vague definition.

1720
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:37,340
And that everything can be put into this definition.

1721
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:43,340
So if there are some gypsy gypsies in Denmark are putting a tent on the grass.

1722
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:46,340
They're being expelled for it.

1723
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:49,340
What the fuck is going on with the European Union?

1724
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:55,340
One of the four basic rights, the freedom of movement is being deraped, violated.

1725
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:57,340
It wouldn't happen in USA.

1726
02:03:57,340 --> 02:04:03,340
Can you imagine that EU, US citizens will be expelled from one US state to another US state,

1727
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:06,340
just because he is of different race.

1728
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,340
Yeah.

1729
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:10,340
Well, dude, you should have been speaking up a lot louder.

1730
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:11,340
You're right.

1731
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:13,340
You didn't speak up when it was your time to speak up.

1732
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:14,340
You fool.

1733
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:19,340
You're unimaginable in EU effect of fucking life.

1734
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:26,340
So European Commission, the government of European Union, staff, we've come in.

1735
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:29,340
It's again, faith, citizens of EU.

1736
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:38,340
And I wanted to say that the EU is wanting a path, not because of the European currency.

1737
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:39,340
You know.

1738
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:41,340
CSB, it was intended.

1739
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:45,340
You're going to fall into European war.

1740
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:47,340
This was all set up ahead of time.

1741
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:48,340
This is nothing new.

1742
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:51,340
How long have I been talking about this with you?

1743
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:57,340
But because of the violation of the basic rights.

1744
02:04:57,340 --> 02:05:01,340
And like I said in this poem, not for him.

1745
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:04,340
This is a quote from the 18th century.

1746
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:06,340
This is really what's going on.

1747
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:11,340
And the counts of European, the days of European Union are counted.

1748
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:14,340
It will be full of paths soon.

1749
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:17,340
And European Commission, I want to say to European Commission,

1750
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:19,340
fuck you as hell.

1751
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:20,340
You betrayed EU citizens.

1752
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:22,340
You are not defending rights of EU citizens.

1753
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,340
They are laughing.

1754
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:25,340
They are laughing at UCSB.

1755
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:26,340
They're laughing at you.

1756
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:28,340
You stupid slave.

1757
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:30,340
And by the way.

1758
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:33,340
The only thing to grammar is a douchebag.

1759
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:36,340
Because he is not sending all your comments.

1760
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:38,340
The only thing to program a resetty.

1761
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:42,340
Oh, I recorded a comment to Adam, but I'm not sending.

1762
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:44,340
Because I don't know.

1763
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,340
I cannot send.

1764
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:48,340
So, this is great when you're hammered.

1765
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:50,340
So, I see that there's a situation.

1766
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:53,340
The end of the way that we know it is coming soon.

1767
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,340
And the similar situation like it was before the World War II,

1768
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:58,340
when the race is once on the rise is now again.

1769
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:04,340
And then you say, in Arizona, in Europe, Italy, France and Denmark.

1770
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:07,340
You said, said, said, so.

1771
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:10,340
Well, I'm going with one thing to say.

1772
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:12,340
Come on, CSB.

1773
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:14,340
Play it out loud with me now.

1774
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:17,340
Because you know when you work out the car.

1775
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:20,340
Shut up, stay.

1776
02:06:24,340 --> 02:06:26,340
All right, first black president is up.

1777
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,340
Ladies and gentlemen, introduce in the first week,

1778
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:32,340
I'm in the first black president of the United States of America.

1779
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:34,340
Presenting blow fly.

1780
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:35,340
Thank you.

1781
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,340
Thank you very much.

1782
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:40,340
And like I promised you, when I was running.

1783
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:43,340
I'm going to make sure they are chillins and every pot.

1784
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:45,340
Helmhooks and every table.

1785
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:48,340
My control peels and every purse.

1786
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:49,340
And we're going to have a war.

1787
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:51,340
You're every mother fucking weekend.

1788
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:52,340
Thank you.

1789
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,340
Good morning, Mr. President and Sir.

1790
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:57,340
Good morning, bit.

1791
02:06:57,340 --> 02:06:58,340
I'm at Ms. Clay.

1792
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:01,340
This shit's going to be easy.

1793
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:04,340
President, don't do not but send on his ass all day.

1794
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:06,340
You're about as in and mother fucking way.

1795
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:07,340
You'll say, get my hair together here.

1796
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:09,340
Where's my fucking cocaine?

1797
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:10,340
Mr. President, sir.

1798
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:11,340
Get your ass in here, please.

1799
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:12,340
Right away, sir.

1800
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:13,340
What did you do in my ship?

1801
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:15,340
Are you constipated, sir?

1802
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:17,340
Mitch, you know what I'm talking about.

1803
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:18,340
My mother fucking wrote all.

1804
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:20,340
Well, I took you to the bed, sir.

1805
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:23,340
I'm talking about coke, coke hanging.

1806
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:27,340
You know that white pot of shit that I put on your pussy when I'm getting ready to eat it?

1807
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:29,340
Oh, that, sir.

1808
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:30,340
It's right in front of you, sir.

1809
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:31,340
Thank you.

1810
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:32,340
That'll be all.

1811
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:34,340
Stupid bitch.

1812
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:38,340
If I put to one so good I fire.

1813
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:43,340
Ms. I get away and get my hair together.

1814
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:46,340
And some bitch shit.

1815
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:48,340
Mr. President, sir.

1816
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:50,340
What the fucking won now?

1817
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:53,340
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

1818
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:56,340
Mr. Jackson, read your Jackson and Andrew Jackson, a macro Jackson.

02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:57,340

1821
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:01,340

1822
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:03,340

Mr. Jackson.

1826
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:08,340
What the fucking won?

1827
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:11,340
He wants the money he promised him for endorsing you.

1828
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:13,340
I told that dumb motherfuckers,

1829
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:16,340
those assholes at Congress got all the fun frozen.

1830
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:18,340
What the fucking won from my life?

1831
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:22,340
Well, he stated that payment and coke would be sufficient.

1832
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:24,340
My last coke.

1833
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:27,340
I'm taking it, give it to the mother fucking get rid of it.

1834
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,340
You're seeing that shit.

1835
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:31,340
I thought that shit was going to be easy.

1836
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:35,340
I got it, I got some weed here somewhere.

1837
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:36,340
Here it is.

1838
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:38,340
Room a couple of joints.

1839
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:46,340
Mr. President, sir.

1840
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:47,340
Shit.

1841
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,340
What you want now, Ms. Clay?

1842
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:52,340

02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:56,340

02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:00,340

Shit.

1850
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:10,340
I can see right now I'm not going to like this mother for getting shit at all.

1851
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:12,340
I'll give it to the mother fucker.

1852
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:17,340
King sniff no coke, King smoking no dope.

1853
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:20,340
Hey, I don't know what I do.

1854
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:22,340
Fuck this bitch again.

1855
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:24,340
Ms. Clay, what you coming here, please?

1856
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:26,340
Night away, sir.

1857
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:28,340
Come on, you're bathing, put off your clothes,

1858
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:30,340
I'm down.

1859
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:32,340
I don't want to hit a shit this morning.

1860
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,340
King smoking no dope, King sniff no coke.

1861
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:36,340
No later, later I can hear all of that shit later.

1862
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:44,340
What is the red spots when you're stumbling?

1863
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:46,340
That's what I was trying to tell you, sir.

1864
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:47,340
What are they?

1865
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:48,340
We see.

1866
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:51,340
I went to the doctor and he says I have her feet.

1867
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:52,340
The happy!

1868
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:54,340
I resigned!

1869
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:56,340
Fuckin' hungry!

1870
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:02,340
That's blowfly!

1871
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:04,340
Oh man.

1872
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:06,340
Little did he know back then.

1873
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:09,340
The first black president of the United States of America.

1874
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:12,340
We used to play that song to death on decibel radio man.

1875
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:13,340
I love playing that song.

1876
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:15,340
It's just too funny.

1877
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:20,340
A couple requests here that I need to take care of as we roll into our third and final hour

1878
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:22,340
of the Fubar Friday extravaganza.

1879
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:25,340
This is from Wilbert Rapps.

1880
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:33,340
Wilbert said he had a nice five-week holiday in the United States of Gitmonation in May of 2010.

1881
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:38,340
And I guess his girlfriend, maybe his former girlfriend went along with him.

1882
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:42,340
And her name is Linda.

1883
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:44,340
Linda from housing.

1884
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:45,340
That's where she's from.

1885
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:46,340
That's the town.

1886
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:50,340
And he said, please, please, please could you play a song for her?

1887
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:53,340
Because I would be eternally grateful.

1888
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:55,340
That's easy, dude.

1889
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,340
It's what we do here.

1890
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:00,340
Apparently she likes this one a lot.

1891
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:02,340
And I kind of concur.

1892
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,340
Citizen of the planet.

1893
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:06,340
I'll land us more and say.

1894
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:09,340
I start up in the north.

1895
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:12,340
I grow from special sea.

1896
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:18,340
I sprinkle it with some salinity from the ranch.

1897
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:21,340
And hungarian snore.

1898
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:29,340
Lingering the shrouding until my young jumps fall.

1899
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:37,340
Then I move across the sea to European bliss.

1900
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:41,340
To language of pelvis.

1901
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:50,340
As I cut the cord of home, I kiss my mother's mother.

1902
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:54,340
Look to the horizon.

1903
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:59,340
Why did I kneel ground?

1904
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:02,340
Come all right.

1905
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:07,340
My youth's surrounding.

1906
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:09,340
I almost didn't know.

1907
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:13,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1908
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:17,340
My country is not a land airplane.

1909
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:20,340
Citizen of the planet.

1910
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:37,340
Then I fly back to my nest.

1911
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:40,340
I fly back with my nuclear.

1912
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:44,340
Everything is different.

1913
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:47,340
So I wait.

1914
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:50,340
My year-on-for-home is broadened.

1915
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:53,340
It's got to some expanded.

1916
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:57,340
My college from beyond.

1917
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:03,340
So I pick my things.

1918
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,340
Nothing precious.

1919
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:10,340
Coffee sacred.

1920
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:12,340
I almost didn't know.

1921
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:14,340
The planet's my old home.

1922
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:16,340
But I don't know.

1923
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:18,340
We've got a chance to come.

1924
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:20,340
Sick with this.

1925
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:21,340
Everything is different.

1926
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,340
So it's the original.

1927
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:25,340
I had a little bit of love.

1928
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:29,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1929
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:32,340
What a teacher is on stage.

1930
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:36,340
And this goes with every pair.

1931
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:39,340
So next few years.

1932
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:41,340
I'm blurry.

1933
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:44,340
The next decades of blurry.

1934
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:49,340
Smells and tastes unknown.

1935
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:50,340
Friends.

1936
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:53,340
So I'm straight through this fabric.

1937
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:56,340
It feels a very color.

1938
02:13:56,340 --> 02:14:01,340
One culture to one lover.

1939
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:03,340
And tonight.

1940
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:06,340
Kill all the night.

1941
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:09,340
Time gets key.

1942
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:11,340
Time.

1943
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:12,340
Together.

1944
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:14,340
Nobody let your life.

1945
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:16,340
Who can I love?

1946
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:18,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1947
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:20,340
I am good young.

1948
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,340
I am glad to find the angel.

1949
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:25,340
And I got a good love.

1950
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:27,340
Here I show my own way.

1951
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:29,340
Who can I love?

1952
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1953
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:33,340
I am good young.

1954
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,340
And tonight.

1955
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:35,340
Kill all the night.

1956
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:36,340
Time.

1957
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:37,340
Together.

1958
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:38,340
One culture to one lover.

1959
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,340
Who can I love?

1960
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:41,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1961
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,340
I am good young.

1962
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:44,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1963
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:45,340
I am good young.

1964
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:46,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1965
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:47,340
I am good young.

1966
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:48,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1967
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:49,340
I am good young.

1968
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:50,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1969
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,340
I am good young.

1970
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:52,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1971
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:53,340
I am good young.

1972
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:54,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1973
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:56,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1974
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1975
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:00,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1976
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:02,340
The planet's my president is gone here.

1977
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:04,340
The island is gone here.

1978
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:22,340
water.

1979
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:30,740
I'm so happy because today from my friends with my head

1980
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:36,340
I'm so happy that's okay because I want you

1981
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:40,340
We'll go here someday more

1982
02:15:40,340 --> 02:15:44,340
Every day if you're all I care

1983
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:50,340
I'm not scared that my candles in our days

1984

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah

02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:19,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so lonely

1986
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:23,340
That's okay, she's my head

1987
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:27,340
Not upset, and just maybe

1988
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:31,340
I'm too plain for all I've heard

1989
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:35,340
I'm not sure, I'm so excited

1990
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:39,340
I can't wait to meet you again

1991
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:43,340
I don't care, I'm so lonely

1992
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:46,340
That's okay, my will is okay

I'm so happy, because today I found my friends in my head

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

No, no, no, no, no, you're my creed

02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:57,340
I miss you, I'm not your life-right

2011
02:18:57,340 --> 02:19:26,840
I'm just a bit of chatroom management going on here, of course the party's always

2012
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:31,960
at noagendachat.com but of course you got to make sure everyone kind of stays in

2013
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:38,640
line. Sorry CSB I just felt like it. That's what two bottles of Guinness will do to you.

2014
02:19:38,640 --> 02:19:42,240
It's Billy Joel, one of the good day young on the Charlie Wake up Virginia.

2015
02:19:56,840 --> 02:20:26,840
I'm just a bit of chatroom management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management management

I know, I'll live a good time

2018
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:07,840
Got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation

2019
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:10,840
You got a brand new soul

2020
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:14,840
In my crossover

2021
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:19,840
Like the TV they didn't give you quite enough information

2022
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:22,840
You didn't count on me

2023
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,840
When you were counting on your lovely

2024
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,840
I want to see it as a heaven

2025
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:30,840
But those who will wait

2026
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:33,840
And some say I'd better but I said it

2027
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,840
I'd have a laugh with the same isn't cry with the same

2028
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:39,840
It seems it's a much more fun

2029
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:43,840
You know, it only took the time

2030
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:46,840
You'll have a baby

2031
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:49,840
You'll live a good time

2032
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,840
You'll have a whole living a good time

2033
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,840
You'll have a totally older life

2034
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:12,840
I could give you as a reputation

2035
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:15,840
Oh, she never can't believe

2036
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:18,840
But if she ever say a prayer for me

2037
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:20,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, come out from now

2038
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:21,840
Come out from now

2039
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:23,840
But if you don't let me wait

2040
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:26,840
You can't feel it girls don't much too late

2041
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:28,840
Sooner or later comes down to be

2042
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:31,840
I'll pack this world with me the war

2043
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:35,840
You know, it only took the time

2044
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:38,840
You'll have a baby

2045
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:42,840
You'll have a whole living a good time

2046
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:45,840
Oh, oh, no

2047
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:49,840
Oh, oh, no

2048
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:59,840
You're crossed by this edge

2049
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:03,840
For someone with great .yot

2050
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:07,840
A couple of things I just want to mention

2051
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:08,840
For those of you who are still wondering

2052
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:11,840
How does she do it? How do I play all these songs

2053
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:23,840
royalties and no, I don't. I don't. I made all these fuckers so much money throughout the past 25 years. They can blow me. However, if you have an iPhone or an Android get a hold of sound-hound or maybe Shazam

2054
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:32,320
And please support the old infrastructure by sound-hounding and Shazamming these songs and then buying them if you really like them. That's all I ask you to do

2055
02:23:41,840 --> 02:24:11,840
I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't

2056
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:41,840
I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I

2057
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:44,840
You know it don't matter anyway

2058
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:47,840
You can rely on your own path, money

2059
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:49,840
You can rely on your own path

2060
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,840
I think there's a big girl

2061
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:52,840
And it's gone too far

2062
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:55,840
Because you know it don't matter anyway

2063
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:58,840
Somebody, they're gonna won't get you too far

2064
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:00,840
Too far, too far

2065
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:03,840
High and high

2066
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:06,840
Out of the rain

2067
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:09,840
It's always in here

2068
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,840
The hurt of this one you can't feel pain

2069
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:14,840
And don't you know

2070
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:17,840
That a love can grow

2071
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,840
Oh, hold the two of us

2072
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:21,840
You can be a fooling around and live

2073
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:23,840
For the thrill of it all

2074
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:25,840
Oh, you're my rich girl

2075
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:26,840
And they're gone too far

2076
02:25:26,840 --> 02:25:29,840
Because you know it don't matter anyway

2077
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:32,840
You can rely on your own path, money

2078
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:34,840
You can rely on your own path

2079
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:36,840
I think there's a big girl

2080
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:38,840
And it's gone too far

2081
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:41,840
Because you know it don't matter anyway

2082
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:44,840
Somebody, they're gonna won't get you too far

2083
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:47,840
Somebody, they're gonna won't get you too far

2084
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:50,840
Somebody, they're gonna won't get you too far

2085
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:54,840
And you'll say, you're my rich girl

2086
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:56,840
I mean, whatever happened to those guys

2087
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:57,840
That's all, the hurt of us

2088
02:25:57,840 --> 02:25:59,840
You're a rich girl

2089
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:02,840
And they're gone too far

2090
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:04,840
You're a rich bitch girl

2091
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:05,840
Holon Oats

2092
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:07,840
On 841

2093
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,840
Okay, I've been

2094
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:12,840
Mustering up a string to do this next request

2095
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:13,840
Is a rough one

2096
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:16,840
By the way, that's the sound of two widgets

2097
02:26:16,840 --> 02:26:17,840
So we're down too

2098
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:19,840
I'm wondering for the last half hour

2099
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:21,840
If I can make it through without another

2100
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:22,840
Guinness, we'll see

2101
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:23,840
I have one more

2102
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:24,840
It's in the fridge

2103
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:25,840
Okay

2104
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,840
All right, hi Adam

2105
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:31,840
This is from a Sebastian Amsterdam

2106
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:34,840
I've been listening to you for a long time

2107
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:36,840
Since the Veronica days of the 80s

2108
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,840
I've been listening to the

2109
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,840
Daily source code

2110
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:40,840
DSE

2111
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,840
Delta share a Charlie since episode 120

2112
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:44,840
Or around there

2113
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:45,840
And I love it

2114
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:46,840
Especially the food bar Fridays

2115
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:48,840
You've been in my ears all over the world

2116
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:50,840
I've requested may sound kind of weird

2117
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:52,840
But it would mean a lot to me if you played it

2118
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:55,840
Last week we heard that after 36 weeks of pregnancy

2119
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:59,840
Our little son had died in his mother's womb

2120
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:02,840
Yesterday my girlfriend Patricia gave birth to him

2121
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:04,840
And we called him fed him

2122
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:06,840
Instead of being the happy parents of a little boy

2123
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:08,840
We now have to bury him this week

2124
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:10,840
For the past six months

2125
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:12,840
We played a small number of songs

2126
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:13,840
To him over and over again

2127
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:14,840
While he was still on the womb

2128
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:16,840
So we could get to know and love music

2129
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:18,840
Could you please play one of them for us on the DSE

2130
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:20,840
Assong that means so much to us

2131
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:22,840
Because of the music as well

2132
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:23,840
Of the lyrics

2133
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,840
They remind us that even though the days are pitch black

2134
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:26,840
For us right now

2135
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:28,840
There will be better days

2136
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:30,840
But thanks Adam

2137
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:32,840
Would need a lot more than you never know

2138
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:35,840
Sebastian, Patricia, my pleasure

2139
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:02,840
And all you've been done

2140
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:04,840
Little darling

2141
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:09,840
It feels like you've since it's been here

2142
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:13,840
It comes a song

2143
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:16,840
It comes a song

2144
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:19,840
And I say it's alright

2145
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,840
It comes a song

2146
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:21,840

It comes a song

2190
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:20,840
Sometimes I've got

2191
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:25,840
Sometimes I've got

2192
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:30,840
Sometimes I've got

2193
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:39,840
Sometimes I've got

2194
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:47,840
In the garden I feel that I see a slowly melting

2195
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:54,840
In the garden it seems like it is simply clear

2196
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:58,840
Here comes the sun

2197
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:02,840
Here comes the sun that's in me

2198
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:07,840
It's all right

2199
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:10,840
Here comes the sun

2200
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:14,840
Here comes the sun

2201
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:20,840
It's all right

2202
02:30:20,840 --> 02:30:23,840
It's all right

2203
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:30,840
Here comes the sun

2204
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:35,840
Here comes the sun

2205
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:42,840
Time can bring you down

2206
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:51,840
And time can bend your knees

2207
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:57,840
Time can break your heart

2208
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:02,840
And leave you begging

2209
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:06,840
Please

2210
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:33,840
Would you know my name

2211
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:40,840
If I saw you in heaven

2212
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:47,840
Will it be the same

2213
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:54,840
If I saw you in heaven

2214
02:31:54,840 --> 02:32:01,840
I must be strong

2215
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:07,840
And carry on

2216
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:14,840
Because I know I don't belong

2217
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:21,840
Here and here

2218
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:31,840
Would you hold my hand

2219
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:39,840
If I saw you in heaven

2220
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:46,840
Would you help me stand

2221
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:54,840
If I saw you in heaven

2222
02:32:54,840 --> 02:33:01,840
I'll find my way

2223
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:07,840
Through nights and day

2224
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:14,840
Because I know I just can't stay

2225
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:19,840
Here in heaven

2226
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:38,840
Time can bring you down

2227
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:46,840
And time can bend your knees

2228
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:53,840
Time can break your heart

2229
02:33:53,840 --> 02:34:01,840
And leave you begging

2230
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:39,840
Beyond the dawn

2231
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:45,840
Where's peace I'm sure

2232
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:52,840
And I know there'll be no more

2233
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:58,840
Toes

2234
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:02,840
Toes

2235
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:03,840
All right

2236
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:05,840
Mr. Paul Anka sings tears

2237
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:08,840
And of course, originally written and composed

2238
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:10,840
And performed by Eric Clapton

2239
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,840
And boy, that really changed the mood

2240
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:14,840
In the chat room

2241
02:35:14,840 --> 02:35:16,840
All of a sudden we got back from pitch to each other

2242
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:19,840
To kind of a family vibe

2243
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:21,840
But like that, that was good

2244
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:23,840
Got about half hour left to go

2245
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:25,840
So I want to make sure we really crank it up

2246
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,840
I did just ask what we should be playing

2247
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:30,840
And it seems like there's a good mood on

2248
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:32,840
For more Paul Anka

2249
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:33,840
And you know what?

2250
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:36,840
That's fine with that

2251
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:40,840
Because this has got to be the song that I've been loving

2252
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,840
For the past year and a half

2253
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:43,840
It really sounded out

2254
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:46,840
I might have to sing along

2255
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:48,840
It's my life

2256
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:50,840
Clean it up Paul

2257
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,840
This ain't a song for the broken heart

2258
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:11,840
The silent prayer for the faith to pardon it

2259
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:18,840
I ain't gonna be just the face of the crown

2260
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:20,840
You're gonna hear my voice

2261
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:22,840
I'll shout it out loud

2262
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:24,840
It's my life

2263
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:28,840
And it's now unbelievable

2264
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:31,840
Ain't gonna live forever

2265
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:35,840
I just wanna live while I'm alive

2266
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:39,840
It's my life

2267
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:42,840
My heart's an open highway

2268
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:46,840
I said I did it my way

2269
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:50,840
Just wanna live while I'm alive

2270
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:53,840
It's my life

2271
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:03,840
This is for the ones who stood their ground

2272
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:11,840
Tommy and Gina who never backed down

2273
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:16,840
Tomorrow's getting hard to make

2274
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:17,840
No mistake

2275
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:19,840
Rocking up

2276
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,840
You gotta make your own breaks

2277
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:24,840
It's my life

2278
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:27,840
And it's now or never

2279
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:31,840
Ain't gonna live forever

2280
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:35,840
Just wanna live while I'm alive

2281
02:37:36,840 --> 02:37:39,840
It's my life

2282
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:42,840
My heart's an open highway

2283
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:46,840
I said I did it my way

2284
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:51,840
I wanna live while I'm alive

2285
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:53,840
It's my life

2286
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:13,840
And it's now or never

2287
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:17,840
Ain't gonna live forever

2288
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:22,840
I just wanna live while I'm alive

2289
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:24,840
It's my life

2290
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:27,840
And it's now or never

2291
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,840
Ain't gonna live forever

2292
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:35,840
I just wanna live while I'm alive

2293
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:38,840
It's my life

2294
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:41,840
And it's an open highway

2295
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:45,840
I said I did it my way

2296
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:50,840
Just wanna live while I'm alive

2297
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:52,840
It's my life

2298
02:38:52,840 --> 02:38:55,840
And it's now or never

2299
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:59,840
Ain't gonna live forever

2300

Just wanna live while I'm alive

Just wanna live while I'm alive

2302
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,840
I just wanna live while I'm alive

2303
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:32,840
It's my life

2304
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:37,840
And it's now or never

2305
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:39,840
Ain't gonna live

2306
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,840
I just wanna live while I'm alive

2307
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:42,840
Well hell yeah

2308
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:43,840
That's what we're all about

2309
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,840
It's my journey

2310
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:46,840
I love rock and roll

2311
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:47,840
Rock and roll

2312
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,840
Pop buckets

2313
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:52,840
I saw him dancing there

2314
02:39:52,840 --> 02:39:54,840
I've all the rest of his shit

2315
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:59,840
I knew he was to be in about seven days

2316
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:01,840
And I've never been there

2317
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:03,840
I was strong

2318
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,840
Playin' like a different song

2319
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:09,840
And I've been till it would be long

2320
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:11,840
It's with me

2321
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:12,840
Yeah me

2322
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:14,840
And I've been till it wouldn't be long

2323
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:17,840
I've been till it would be long

2324
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:19,840
I'll go by you

2325
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:20,840
Just for you long

2326
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:21,840
Time isn't too far

2327
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:24,840
Your life and I drove you

2328
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:27,840
Spill me in time and dance like you

2329
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:37,840
It's my time to lock it up and ask for his name

2330
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:42,840
Let's don't matter if it's all the same

2331
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:47,840
Take your heart where we can't be alone

2332
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:50,840
