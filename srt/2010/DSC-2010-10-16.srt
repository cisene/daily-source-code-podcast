This year has changed

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280

97
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,880
I was always thinking to myself, it's so amazing how the pharmaceutical company, of course

98
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,000
I didn't think of them as pharmaceutical companies, but how the drug companies are always

99
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
advertising, claritan, and all kinds of anti-conjusted and congested stuff, and flu medicine,

100
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,720
and always at the right time, just when I had the flu, and it's been pretty bad for the

101
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,480
fast week or so, and now it seems that everybody has it, I mean, you just got to think

102
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,880
that even early on, I knew that there was some kind of conspiratorial behavior going on

103
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,520
between all of these companies, doing all this weird shit, anyway, got to get your flu shot

104
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
everybody, right?

105
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:09,520
She was, and then I left the place to become a man, and I never thought I'd see her again,

106
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:21,520
and I even failed, remember in her name, but the other night, and the studio fit me,

107
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:31,520
she can suddenly walk in through the window, and she said it now, in my mind again

108
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I can live for another thousand years when I see the eyes of Jenny,

109
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:57,520
because I can't say that to another place, another time, and I remember in her name,

110
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:08,520
but when I see the eyes of Jenny, if that may take me to where she knows how far the

111
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:24,520
place of mine, she's so me, she's almost a twenty-five, and through some struggle,

112
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:36,520
and some strategy is pretty, ooh, like shit was, it's not the color,

113
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:50,520
not the size, yes it's the promise, and those eyes and makes it pretty, through like shit was,

114
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:58,520
and then I left the place to become a man, I don't know if I'll ever see her again,

115
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:10,520
but I'll always be, remember in her name, because the other night, and the studio fit me,

116
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:20,520
she can suddenly walk in through the window, and she said it now, in my mind again

117
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:34,520
I can live for another thousand years when I see the eyes of Jenny,

118
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:44,520
because I can't say that to another place, another time, and I remember in her name,

119
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,520
I remember in her name, and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name,

120
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,520
and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name,

121
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:04,520
and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name,

122
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,520
and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name, and I remember in her name,

123
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,520
and I remember, thank you very much, Ray, who will be dropping by later with Ray on the Charlie episode 44,

124
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I have not listened to it, of course, because, well, that's the big surprise, he rolls out the soundtrack to my life.

125
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:36,520
And I think we've turned yet another corner with a daily source coverage, of course, started off actually as a really just a test broadcast for

126
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,280
The engineers out there making receivers better known as podcast aggregators now we've

127
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,200
morphed into this three to three and a half hour show every single at least once a

128
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
week.

129
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm pretty much once a week and it used to be me pulling stuff off of not actually it

130
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,040
was a pod safe music and then it was independent music and then it was iTunes music

131
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,720
and now with the advent of of Dropbox being added to the mix it's fantastic.

132
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,840
I've really like in this you guys have shared all these Dropboxes with me and I literally

133
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,480
have just watched the songs come in throughout the week and I'm like okay I can

134
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,560
remember to play that and you are actually controlling the program and it's

135
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,880
entirety now so if you want to please share your Dropbox with me and don't

150
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:35,800
I have been driving around Los Angeles quite a bit actually, I've been looking for apartments

151
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,320
with Christina, I run a couple errands, now that I have a car actually it's nice, of course

152
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,720
we have the soft 9 or 3 from 1999 and with one headlight kind of falling off, the lights

153
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,720
that perpetually remain on, but it's a convertible, it's a good point, so I'm listening

154
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,720
to a lot of radio because it has a decent sound, decent, I'll not say great, but that's

155
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,240
a decent sound system, and oh the radio sucks, so bad, it's like unless you're into

156
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:13,560
really into hip hop and the real mainstream stuff which I'm kind of not, although I

157
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,760
find it gets myself listening to it for like 20 minutes on it, and then it just starts

158
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:25,000
to repeat, like wow, the radio has become so incredibly shit, it's so bad, I was gonna

159
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,440
go somewhere with this, I'm not quite sure, I'm still a little fuzzy in the head, that's essentially

160
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:38,440
what's happening here, but let me collect my thoughts on that, let me just play a couple

161
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,480
more songs before I can really break it down and talk to you guys, now what's cool about

162
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,160
this Dropbox thing is some people are doing exactly what I hope they would do, I like

163
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,600
Citizen X and they're dropping songs, but they're also dropping little note in, so there's

164
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,040
a Citizen X readme.txt file and her shared folder, and hold on a second, would you please

165
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,480
let me, don't Skype me on, I'm doing the show, it's not a good idea, yeah, I was gonna relate

166
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,040
this to the music business, how that is changing as well, of course Prince who has refused to

167
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,120
be with any mainstream, big record label for a long time, has been looking at alternative

168
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,320
sources of distribution, although he seems to be kind of against any type of internet distribution

169
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,960
in general, although I have yet to hear directly out of his mouth other than through some

170
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,160
interview that was done and I think it was, I wonder if he's the telegraph, I think it was the

171
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,440
same paper where he actually released a CD, because this is what certainly in the United Kingdom

172
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,400
where in Gitmonation East where the newspapers are still kind of a cultural thing and they

173
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,600
really go out and try and get news, I'm not gonna say they actually do a great job of it, but they

174
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,560
have relatively large distribution and Prince decided to release his latest album exclusively in

175
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,560
Gitmo East through, I think it was the telegraph, I'm sure the chatroom will correct me if I'm wrong

176
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,360
and Citizen X did a great thing here and she ripped the CD for me and she put a couple of the

177
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,960
tunes into her Dropbox and I kind of like this one which I want to share with you, this is old school

178
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:21,960
company, listen to the lyrics, let's think this song, get a kick out of it,

179
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:31,000
show me what, this is my song, I'm not here yet, I look here y'all, flop hat hot pants and go

180

181
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:50,120

182
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:58,760
song in the love family, through the documentary, it's all just a little up to it, I haven't

183
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,480
thought that we can't believe it, everybody talking about hot time, like I just thought it

184
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,920
destined it, people I know they've been struggling, at least it seems that way, back

185
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:20,040
cats on Wall Street, they got a bailout, why somebody else got to wait, 700 billion

186
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:27,000
but my old neighbor who ain't nothing changed but the date, listen, everyone's a new, wow,

Power to the people.

Target your speakers!

251
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
Get it.

252
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,540
The new mini-apple sound.

253
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Honey Colletia, drop the needle round.

254
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
I'll scoops from the name.

255
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,940
I'll scoops from the name of the day.

256
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
I'll hide what you do.

257
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,940
See that another like me for this chocolate box.

258
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
You've got a dance for me baby.

259
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
You want to see me rock.

260
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Call the government name and tell them we got to be free.

261
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,940
Valentino tonight, but I'm busy.

262
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,940
Tell your mama 77, Beverly Park.

263
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
It's better for time.

264
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,940
You got the old school company y'all dancing in the dark.

265
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
I don't mind.

266
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
I don't mind.

267
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Put this thing over your feet.

268
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Go back to one and just move your feet.

269
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Just your friends.

270
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Sprints in the mini-apple the sound.

271
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,940
We think beep beep.

272
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,940
I'll scoops from the name of the day.

273
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,940
I'll scoops from the name of the day.

274
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,940
I'll scoops from the name of the day.

275
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,940
I dare motherfuckers of jeans.

276
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
As with most print songs.

277
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,940
You got to kind of get into it and get used to it.

278
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,940
When you hear that guitar whale, it's like, oh yeah, that's him.

279
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
That's a man for Minneapolis.

280
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,940
And he's got so much the right idea.

281
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
The man is a prophet and a poet.

282
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
The white house is black.

283
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
We got to take the radio back.

284
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Fuck yeah.

285
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,940
I'm not quite sure if he means it in the same way that we do.

286
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
But yeah, we got to take the radio back.

287
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Instead of actually going to go around it.

288
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,940
And we're just always created our own radio here.

289
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,940
You know, that app phone you've gotten your hand right now.

290
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
That is the new radio.

291
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Now, only prints will get on board with the program.

292
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,940
And understand that we need to really build up shows like this.

293
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Streams like a Noah gender screen.

294
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,940
And the automobile companies need to start putting that crap into their cars.

295
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,940
It's a stupid serious XM.

296
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,940
You just wait till those guys have to finance another one of those satellites.

297
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
It has to go on.

298
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,940
It's probably another two years before they have to shoot another one in the space.

299
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
And they will be out of money.

300
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Then what?

301
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
Then what?

302
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Where's a couple of boneheads can kind of get it together and put it up.

303
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Because I'm not that pretty decent.

304
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Of course completely illegally.

305
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,940
No rights paid here.

306
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,940
But I've got proof that this type of system does so records.

307
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,940
That all is fair in love.

308
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:44,940
And one of the things I'll be happy with my mistake is that you're made.

309
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,940
She has a ball or two.

310
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,940
And I'm telling you to use it.

311
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,940
So you don't have it in another way.

312
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:05,940
All of you.

313
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,940
All of you.

314
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,940
All of you.

315
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
Fuck all of you.

316
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
We're here.

317
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:24,940
All of you.

318
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Fuck all of you.

319
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:34,940
We're here to drop.

320
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,940
Fuck all of you.

321
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,940
We're here to drop.

322
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Fuck all of you.

323
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:59,940
We're here to drop.

324
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Fuck all of you.

325
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:09,940
We're here to drop.

326
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Fuck all of you.

327
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:25,940
We're here to drop.

328
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,940
Fuck all of you.

329
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:44,940
We're here to drop.

330
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Fuck all of you.

331
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:31,940
We're here to drop.

332
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Fuck all of you.

333
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:48,940
We're here to drop.

334
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Fuck all of you.

335
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:10,940
We're here to drop.

336
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Fuck all of you.

337
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:32,940
We're here to drop.

338
00:33:49,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Okay, inadvertently I've lifted a bit of the veil behind how it works here.

339
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:21,940
You see, I've set up another improvement to the system where I now have my, what is it?

340
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,940
The fader fox, MIDI controller, mixer, panel thingy.

341
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,940
I've added that to the mix along with the new iPad control panel for Ableton Live.

342
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,940
It's a lot of gobbledy goof for people who don't give a crap work.

343
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:47,940
So I was actually testing a combination of a jingle and a song together and I kept doing it over and over thinking that that was outside of the broadcast.

344
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Of course you guys heard most of that.

345
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,940
The combination of a lovely meal last night with Miss Mickey and Molly would where we had an amazing discussion.

346
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:08,940
I have to say it was it was pretty analogous to almost like a no agenda except there was two chicks and they were beaten up on me pretty hard.

347
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:16,940
I have to say I was not really losing but they had a real shut up slave thing about them and they were probably right.

348
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:26,940
And then also my dinner showed up and it was this link we need with white truffle and I just decided to really shut up and just enjoy that really be quiet.

349
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,940
But of course you know we had a drink or two and I got up early this morning and the weather is it's completely sucked in here.

350
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:40,940
It's been shit for two days and I just the whole my head is fuzzy everything is like, what's going on? Where am I?

351
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,940
I'm truly the second best thing in the universe.

352
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:18,940
But it's something that I must believe in and it's there when I look in your eyes.

353
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,940
Lovers in the air in the whisper of the tree.

354
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,940
Lovers in the air in the thunder of the sea.

355
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,940
And I don't know if I'm just drinking it.

356
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,940
Don't know if I feel safe.

357
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:49,940
But if something that I must believe in and it's there when I call out my name.

358
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:59,940
Lovers in the air.

359
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:09,940
Lovers in the air.

360
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Lovers in the air.

361
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Lovers in the air.

362
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:25,940
And I don't know if I'm just drinking it.

363
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
Lovers in the air.

364
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,940
And the day is nearly done.

365
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,940
And I don't know if I'm just drinking it.

366
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Don't know if I see it true.

367
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,940
But it's something that I must believe in and it's there when I look in your eyes.

368
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,940
Lovers in the air.

369
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,940
And I don't know if I'm just drinking it.

370
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,940
Lovers in the air.

371
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,940
And I don't know if I'm just drinking it.

372
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,940
Don't know if I'm just drinking it.

373
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:19,940
But if something that I must believe in and it's there when I look in your eyes.

374
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Lovers in the air.

375
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Lovers in the air.

376
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Oh yes.

377
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,940
The human resources are getting all up in the chat room.

378
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,940
No agenda chat dot net.

379
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,940
Half of course thinking, hey, where's the songs that make my ears bleed, man?

380
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,940
It's a snafu Saturday.

381
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,940
Remember, it's only just hit 12 o'clock here.

382
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,940
It was a long week, a lot of stuff, a lot of work.

383
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
And then you sit down for three hours show.

384
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,940
You got to kind of ease into what you can't just be rolling out the crap right off the bat.

385
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,940
By the way, I do like when you guys delete songs from your shared dropboxes.

386
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,940
They actually move out of my dropbox as well.

387
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
That's phenomenal.

388
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
Cool.

389
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
Clean the shit up that I've played already.

390
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,940
That the wheel falls down.

391
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:37,940
I'm trying to figure out where it all went wrong.

392
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,940
It's day in another industry.

393
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
All my soul crush and dizzy.

394
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,940
Got to get back into the room.

395
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,940
Little bird on your shoulder.

396
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,940
Sign up for a million songs.

397
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,940
Might be soon be far along.

398
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,940
Got to get back into the back yard.

399
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,940
It'll look a bit better.

400
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
Get out of the room.

401
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Get along.

402
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Get back into the room.

403
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,940
Get on the right yard.

404
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,940
Got to keep back into the room.

405
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Olive in the walls.

406
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Head on to our roof, head on to our trash town.

407
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,940
And then before the sauna,

408
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Give way the go up first.

409
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,940
Got to get that in the room.

410
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,940
Oh, I can't see.

411
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,940
It's just a dream and when you live here

412
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,940
You just have to live in a long gone

413
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,940
Little girl, I know she'll never say ever before

414
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,940
It's only for you

415
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Yeah, good thing, good action

416
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Get on the right track

417
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Get on the right track

418
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Take it long

419
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,940
Get on the right track

420
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,940
Take it long

421
00:41:41,940 --> 00:42:11,940
Yeah, back, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

422
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:37,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, well that's

423
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:43,120
Nice, found in the Dropbox, and something I never would have played otherwise.

424
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,720
Get back Jack here in the Daily Source Code episode 8-4-Niner on the Snathoo Saturday for October

425
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,720
16th, 2010, man, where's the time gone?

426
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
It's going so quickly.

427
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,600
You know, if I showed any of my old radio guys to set up that we have together, they would

428
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
shit themselves.

429
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,040
They would poop in their pants, because I've also got this growl note of, growl notification

430
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
set up.

431
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,680
So when something is added or deleted, apparently I didn't know that deleted from the Dropbox,

432
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,400
it tells me that.

433
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,080
And here we go, and I could create all the coconuts, and I'm not your Daddy MP3 was removed

434
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
from the Dropbox.

435
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,080
This is perfect.

436
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,720
They would kill themselves over a setup like this, where all I have to do is I'm just

437
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
the glue.

438
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,960
I'm sitting in between all the stuff, and I'm just trying to play all the things you guys

439
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
are dropping into the box.

440
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
It works out perfectly.

441
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
I love this.

442
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I totally love it.

443
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,880
You know, sometimes there are bands that are way ahead of their time with the message.

444
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,840
And I have to point out the George Michael actually was calling out Tony Blair as George

445
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,920
Bush's monkey, monkey boy sitting on his lap, sucking his shlong, and people ridiculed

446
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
him for it.

447
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,280
They laughed, and said, oh, he's lost his way.

448
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,560
And of course, he actually did kind of lose his way, a little bit too much of the of the

449
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,560
refer.

450
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,800
I think it just served time for that.

451
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,400
But I think the guy was on a lot of, he'd saw what was happening, and maybe that's

452
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,600
why he just couldn't handle it, and he started smoking himself into oblivion.

453
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,320
Know what that's about.

454
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,760
But I was checking through the Dropbox, I don't know who's this came from, but wow,

455
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,800
if you would remember the video for this song, which was actually from a British television

456
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,800
show called Spitting Image with this Spitting Image, where they had pretty life-like,

457
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:31,080
characterized puppets or puppets, or, yeah, some kind of combination of that.

458
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,240
It was a satirical television show of political world leaders, see, I think it was Reagan

459
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
in this one.

460
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,480
Margaret Thatcher was in this one, a couple others, and the song, well, it was just fantastic.

461
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,120
Of course, you recognize that drum beat immediately is that of Phil Collins, if Genesis

462
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,240
landed the fuse on deadly source code, eight, four, nine are.

463
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,800
I'm stitching the thousand dreams, fit on it by a million screens,

464
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:09,840
back in here and marching feet, moving into the street, and did you read the news

465
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:18,960
two days, they still didn't do it down our way, but I can see the fire still light.

466
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:31,040
But in into the night, there's too many things, too many people, we can't do many problems.

467
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,800
I'm not much loved in a crowd, I can't see it, it's just what I don't think it would have.

468
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:53,360
Who this is the world leader, and these are hands together, you think let's start trying

469
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,440
to make it a very swallow to be in.

470
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Who Superman, where are you now, where everything's the most amount, for men to steal,

471
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:25,920
and we're not power, losing control by the hour, this is the time, this is the place

472
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,240
so we're not a future, but there's so much love to around,

473
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:48,320
and we're not a future, this is the world leader, and these are hands together,

474
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:56,240
you think let's start trying to make it a very swallow to be in.

475
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:19,200
I'm not much loved in a crowd, I can't see it, it's just what I don't think it would have.

476
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,200
I'm not much loved in a crowd, I can't see it, it's just what I don't think it would have.

477
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:36,160
I'm not much loved in a crowd, I can't see it, it's just what I don't think it would have.

478
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:14,480
I won't be coming home tonight, my generation will put it right, we're not just making promises,

479
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:25,440
but we don't, we never keep, we never keep, we never, there's too many people making too many problems,

480
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:33,440
and I'm not much loved in a crowd, I can't see it, it's just what I don't think it would have.

481
00:48:33,440 --> 00:49:02,000
I just started to connect a couple dots, while I was giving me that whole wrap about George Michael,

482
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:09,520
so George Michael, who I think is an excellent songwriter, may I write a lot about loves and

483
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:16,400
sacks and stuff like that, but he's, he's prolific, he's a poet, I was one of the best songwriters of

484
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,440
the 80s and 90s, completely ridiculed, he's now become a big joke in the United Kingdom,

485
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,920
he's a big joke over here too, people say, oh, he's like wham, he wrote a lot of great,

486
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,240
you know, somebody please drop a couple of George Michael's solo songs into the Dropbox,

487
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:41,360
he wrote some really, really good stuff, I don't care what you say, completely vilified,

488
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:48,160
completely ridiculed in the United Kingdom, but Phil Collins, who also called out the governments,

489
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,360
also ridiculed in the United Kingdom, I don't know if you know about Nanny Gate,

490
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,000
but this guy, you know, he people, Phil Collins become a big joke in the United Kingdom,

491
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,080
still love the world over, but in the United Kingdom where I actually called out the government

492
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,400
in songs like this with Genesis, completely ridiculed, we go figure, now you know why,

493
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,480
I just like to call myself a crack pot up front, so they just leave me alone, it's much easier

494
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,960
that way, believe it or not, that is the sound of an invasion, yes that is the sound created by

495
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,920
the musical invasion of America by the world's hottest recording group, a try and a cool quest quest quest,

496
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,120
they are not conformists to such a great degree that don't seem members ever dress alike,

497
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:44,160
and many educators consider their popularity resulted from their becoming symbols of teenage rebellion.

498
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:59,520
They certainly are ricking in a lot of good, free and American money and gathering

499
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,200
efforts of thousands of teenage fans in the process.

500
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Can I kick it?

501
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,000
That's what I love, I love what flat soul is what we're above, if you disus people

502
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,200
even think of, we'll nip up a dog and give a big shove, this with a real if it's like a

503
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,560
strong club, like a box of positives, it's a plus love, as a child floss, high like a dog.

504
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:30,960
