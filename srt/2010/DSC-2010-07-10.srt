You know, I'm not quite sure exactly what the vibe is going to be today.

150
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
We're going to go back and forth just a little bit.

He loves to be spoken to.

179
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
His happy name is one.

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
His happy name is one.

181
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
His happy name is one.

182
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
We're only making plans, but I knew

183
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,940
We only won what's best for him

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,440
We're only making plans, but I knew

185
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,940
I knew just needs this outfit I knew

186
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,940
And if your night just says he's happy, he must be happy

187
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,940
He must be happy, he must be happy in his world

188
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,940
We only won what's best for him

189
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,940
We're only making plans, but I knew

190
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
And Nigel's one lucky bastard, Annie

191
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Next to you see making plans for Nigel on the Charlie's Snaps

192
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,940
From Saturday, Adhesion, for July 10th, 2010

193
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,940
We've got some good news, there is now an official official official

194
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,940
DSC iPhone app that will give you access to all of the episodes

195
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:18,940
As well as the stream, so you can find that in the show notes that is sourcecode.com

196
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,940
And of course when that goes to the Apple store, the app store now and find it if you so wish

197
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,940
Oh man, what a week it's been pretty crazy

198
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Mickey celebrated her 40th birthday

199
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,940
We had a nice little party, a celebration here on Thursday

200
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
With an interesting mix of people

201
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,940
I was like 50, 60 people here

202
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,940
I really didn't realize we had so many friends in Los Angeles

203
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,940
And we had TV stars, movie stars, porn stars, food stars

204
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,940
Yeah, people who are way into food

205
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,940
We had artists, we had musicians, it was really awesome

206
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,940
It was good, I think I'm still a little bit hung over though

207
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,940
I just got it

208
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,940
I got an ease into it all, that's what the Snaps who Saturdays are all about

209
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,940
So we go back and forth and of course a bit later on I will attempt to make your ears bleed

210
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
As we roll out the harder stuff

211
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,940
The Snaps who Saturdays the Charlie A39er with the Eagles

212
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

242
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:42,940

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

243
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,820
When I need it now

244
00:16:47,820 --> 00:17:05,460
Ooh, you and the ginger garlic

245
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,660
Come on, a hand choose where I'm going to stand

246
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,860
You get your baby one who is nice

247
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,260
I wanna be your star

248
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,660
Who hurt you?

249
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Who hurt you?

250
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,460
Who wanna be your star?

251
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,060
Who wanna be my star?

252
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,860
Who can feel you?

253
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,460
Who can feel you?

254
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,660
Who wanna be your star?

255
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,460
I can't feel how I'm just white

256
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,460
I wanna stand in love

257
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Who is both of my heart

258
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Who can feel you?

259
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,460
Who can feel you?

260
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Who wanna be your star?

261
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Who wanna be your star?

262
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,460
Who wanna be your crazy crazy crazy

263
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,460
Who wanna be your star?

264
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Who wanna be my star?

265
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Who can feel you?

266
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,460
They actually have forgotten mention

267
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,460
They'll make it in her intensive acting course today

268
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,460
And she had a whole bunch of her acting buddies over

269
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
For the party as well

270
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Oh my god

271
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
Just like a bunch of hot little actresses running around

272
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Then every single time she introduced me to wonder

273
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
Like, Hey, wanna get in the hot tub?

274
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,460
She's become kind of running joke

275
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,460
But I think I might actually pull it off

276
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,460
One of these days

277
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
all the girls might come over and hang out.

278
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,980
Mickey knows how to throw a party, man.

279
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,460
She's like, hey, I invited a whole bunch of good-looking girls.

280
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,660
Ha ha ha.

281
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,020
Yay.

282
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,140
Totally loved that.

283
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,940
That was good.

284
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,820
He was good.

285
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,620
And so by the way, those of you on the stream,

286
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,020
screaming for a mismicky, she's just not here today.

287
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,380
Which means that I can sit here in my unshaveness

288
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,300
with my t-shirt on and do my thing.

289
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,500
Which is sharing all the awesome tunes with you guys on the Charlie.

290
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
Episode 839

291
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Isn't it the way these sad girls?

292
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:44,820
Let's forget all that and give me the number if you can't find it.

293
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,500
So I can't call just to tell them I'm finding to show.

294
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,740
How to become the float.

295
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I learned to take it well.

296
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,420
I'll never wish my words would just convince myself

297
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,460
that it just wasn't real.

298
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
But that's not the way it feels.

299
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,020
I've already gone.

300
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,820
Go could you help me please this call?

301
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,660
I can't read the number that you just gave me.

302
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,620
There's something in my eyes.

303
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,540
You know it happens every time.

304
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,380
So think about the love that I thought would save me.

305
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,500
What isn't that the way these sad girls?

306
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,300
Let's forget all that and give me the number if you can't find it.

307
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,700
So I can't call just to tell them I'm finding to show.

308
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,380
Over call the float.

309
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,140
I've learned to take it well.

310
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,980
I'll never wish my words would just convince myself that it just wasn't real.

311
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,940
But that's not the way it feels.

312
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,540
No, no, no, no.

313
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
That's not the way it feels.

314
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,540
I'll never read all.

315
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,060
Let's forget about this call.

316
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,580
No one there.

317
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,820
I really wanted to talk to.

318
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,100
Thank you for your time.

319
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,780
How you been so much more than kind.

320
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,380
You keep the time.

321
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,500
Isn't that the way these sad girls?

322
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,380
Well, let's forget all that and give me the number if you can't find it.

323
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,780
So I can't call just to tell them I'm finding to show.

324
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,460
Over call the float.

325
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,140
I've learned to take it well.

326
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,140
I'll never wish my words would just convince myself that it just wasn't real.

327
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,180
But that's not the way it feels.

328
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,500
Oh, yeah, I haven't heard this song and so long.

329
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,060
Jim Krochi, another guy that I miss.

330
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:30,900
They're good.

331
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,940
This that he brought to the world.

332
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,380
Operator on the daily source code.

333
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,660
The snafu set are the additions.

334
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,260
We kind of roll into it all and wake up nice and slow.

335
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,060
I have, uh, I got some love man the other day.

336
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,300
I got some massive massive love and I want to give it right back in the mail.

337
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,540
On Thursday afternoon, couldn't have come at a better time.

338
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,460
Of course, we had the party going on and the mailman rings the bell.

339
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,060
He's got two packages for me.

340
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,620
One from my good friend, Mr. oil, who I believe is in the chat room.

341
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:06,180
Now, it's no agenda chat.com and from Charles known as CQ and they both sent me

342
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,820
massive quantities of old hole burn rolling tobacco.

343
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,020
Got me some, uh, risla ultra long king size slim rolling papers.

344
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,980
You know, this will be good for at least another six weeks.

345
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,180
I cannot tell you how much that touches me.

346
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,660
It really does. I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's obviously it's not about the money, uh,

347
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,060
and neither of these guys will take any, uh, reimbursement for, uh, for sending this to me.

348
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,340
But it's the, you know, the trouble.

349
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,940
So, I want to go through the trouble to, to buy packs of tobacco, which are just unavailable here

350
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,820
in the United States and send them to me because they know how, how happy it makes me.

351
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,260
It really does. I am so incredibly happy and thankful. I really, really appreciate it.

352
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,340
And, uh, I love you guys. That's the best kind of value for value you could have given me.

353
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm telling you better than any type of donation. I love you.

354
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I know if you know what I mean.

355
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:29,700
The loss of me is to talk on a cereal box, really, which I, uh,

356
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,860
is a smile on a dough. I'm not aware of too many things.

357
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,900
I know what I know of, didn't know what I mean to do.

358
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:52,180
Yeah, show me the share of what, before I give to you.

359
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:03,860
What I am is what I am you, what you are, what, what I am is what I am you, what you are,

360
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,340
Oh, how to wear, you many things, I know what I know if you know what I mean.

361
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,420
The loss of me is to talk on a cereal box, really, which I,

362
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:32,180
like before, I'm not aware of too many things. I know I love you, I am me.

363
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
To do yet.

364
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:47,860
Show me the shallow water before I teach you to do.

365
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Show me the shallow water before I teach you to do.

366
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,860
What I have is what I have you, what you want.

367
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,860
What I have is what I have you, what you want.

368
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,860
What I have is what I have you, what you want.

369
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,860
What I have is what I have you, what you want.

370
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:32,860
How I live, how I live, how I live, how I live, how I say I see I say oh you, yeah.

371
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Why are you so many things looking this beautiful, you're not going to know that I read, write, write.

372
00:26:41,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Yeah, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

373
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:36,540
She'll meet the shell of one before our empty city She'll meet the shell of one before our empty city

374
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Show me in the shallow water, be bucketed to deep

375
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,540
Show me in the shallow water, be bucketed to deep

376
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,540
Show me in the shallow water, be bucketed to deep

377
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Show me in the shallow water, be bucketed to deep

378
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Water, don't let me get to deep

379
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,540
Don't let me get to deep

380
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,540
Don't let me get to deep

381
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,540
Don't let me get to deep

382
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Water, don't let me get to deep

383
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,540
Water, don't let me get to deep

384
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Water, don't let me get to deep

385
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
I remember the first time I heard that song on the radio

386
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,540
I was driving into New York City from the garden state from New Jersey

387
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,540
It's like, holy crap

388
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
I love this

389
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,980
The sound, the Edybrokelle's voice, it's the whole thing, just really fit together nicely.

390
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,940
Edybrokelle, the new bohemians on the snafu setter edition of the Charlie episode A39er,

391
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,580
we've got a full chat room where the party, of course, really takes place.

392
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,780
Let's turn it up a little bit past 10, shall we?

393
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,940
Maybe, by the time we get to mid-Song, we'll turn it up to 11.

394
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,140
I got to tell you the story about this song, too, we've never heard of it before.

395
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,140
How it came about?

396
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,540
Well, the Charlie smoked on the water.

397
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,820
Why doesn't Calvehwood work in this second?

398
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Well, we didn't have much time, but things have happened a lot more, but I have the best ways around.

399
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,540
The song, stupid, we're the player.

400
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Turn the face to the ground.

401
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

402
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,020
Let's turn it down again and win the house.

403
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,820
It's not the world of all sound.

404
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,340
I've come to call the party dinner now.

405
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Oh, it gives out the ground.

406
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,380
When it all comes over, we had a flat and another player.

407
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:57,220
The Swiss town was coming out.

408
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:04,580
It seemed to be a bit busy waiting to be Black.

409
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,420
ball-down, we did it.

410
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,940
No!

411
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,940

You

425
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Don't

426
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Throw

427
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Throw

428
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
Throw

429
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
Throw

430
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Throw

431
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
Throw

432
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Throw

433
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
Do

434
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Throw

435
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940

Throw

438
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:36,380
All right, whenever you get hit a little bit of cowbell, the sun just comes out and starts

439
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,380
shining, love and smoke on the water, deep purple on the Charlie, hey there was one of

440
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:48,300
Mickey's actors friends, we were talking about cowbell at the party and he did the perfect

441
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,940
James Dickinson, what does it know, not James Dickinson, Bruce Dickinson imitation from

442
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,140
the Saturday Night Live Skid and I think I actually literally pissed my pants, it was so

443
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,540
incredibly awesome, oh yes, nothing like a little bit of cowbell to get you going in the

444
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:11,540
morning, okay, let's see if we can look at it and split with this one, thanks for all

467
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:56,820
I do not follow the world cup as you know, but I believe Germany and Uruguay are playing right now battling out for third and fourth place boy, that must suck major balls when you're not allowed to win and you have to play for third and fourth place

468
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:03,820
of course we'll talk more about that tomorrow in the morning on the Norwegian to show as we know that the fix is in

469
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:47,820
to be too small size that's better after all to close to climb a quintet to a screw sazine

470
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:56,820
let's see the spends and out of the van a line in the outside far and raise the rice

471
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:49,820
life's too short there's not marijuana one size fits all to close to climb the track

472
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:32,820
so what's the problem? let's go as quick to pay me now pay for the lead life's too short

473
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,820
so what's the problem?

474
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:09,820
so what's the problem?

475
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:42,820
so what's the problem?

476
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,820
you must obey me

477
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:09,820
what's the problem?

478
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:39,820
it's the start of this event way back in 2008 the Netherlands reached the third world cup final with a

479
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:51,820
three-two win over Uruguay in an exciting semi-final in Ketown on Tuesday the Dutch will play the final match against Spain for the ultimate prize of football at

480
00:45:51,820 --> 00:46:00,820
the city on Johannesburg on Sunday so only good orange grays around here I'm sure you'll understand that

481
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:09,820
however the only media reporting story about a 14-year-old boy who has paid the highest price for his and to shatham for the world cup

482
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:17,820
the neighbor shot the kid because he blew a little too long on his fuzella the cruise on incident took place two weeks ago

483
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:25,820
but it's only now brought out by the authorities the young South African has just watched the match South Africa friends

484
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:34,820
a blue after a two-one victory for his homeland on his fuzella his neighbor probably couldn't handle the sound of that beautiful piece of instrument

485
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,820
a shut the boy down with three bullets he had two conchet wounds in the head and one in his arm

486
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,820
the teenager was still thinking too hospital but died from his injuries

487
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:52,820
so that's a kind of whole different world cup story huh but you will be reading this in our newspapers

488
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,820
so there's gotta be a positive side on this whole world cup championship

489
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:04,820
oh yeah Dutch porn star Bobby Teden will treat a twitter followers with a blowjob

490
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:14,820
her account crew to 60,000 members so she's going to be very busy for a while

491
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:20,820
I mean our government can offer us such a nice deal so please please God

492
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:27,820
I have to talk to God now please let us beat the kingdom of Spain and there will be blow jobs all over

493
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,820
Amen

494
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:37,820
If the Netherlands become the world champion it completes to an additional economic growth of around a half percent

495
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:42,820
but even without the Dutch economy gets a clear boost

496
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:49,820
it's all about trust that's basically it and because of the confidence we'll find it easier to spend money

497
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:56,820
the government are now in the growth of 1.25% this year and 1.75% for the next year

498
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,820
big companies can score with the championship

499
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:06,820
a much more importantly the Netherlands will get a use exposure in the world

500
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:12,820
so yeah at this point we don't need a government we just want to win the golden cup

501
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,820
it's going to be an exciting weekend in the lower countries

502
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:22,820
so my fellow chuckleheads would you please please all keep your fingers crossed

503
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,820
save a little prayer for the Dutch economy

504
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,820
thank you

505
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,820
I'm going to wish you all a very nice weekend

506
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,820
that by now

507
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,820
this is a Norwegian stream and daily source code special report

508
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:42,820
as reported I believe live during one of the most recent daily source codes

509
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:48,820
the no agenda official no agenda porn princess and of course adult film star Bobby Eden

510
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,820
has promised through her twitter account

511
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,820
blow jobs to every twitter follower

512
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:01,820
should the Netherlands win the world cup now from what I understand

513
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,820
the western media has been

514
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:10,820
visually pursuing Bobby to get her on for an interview to talk about this

515
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:17,820
and Bobby Eden has chosen the no agenda stream and daily source code audience

516
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:22,820
to do the only and exclusive interview about this promise

517
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,820

00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,820

00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,700
No, I was going to ask if you're going to do any shows in the United States, anything

576
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,700
while you're here, or is that just pure vacation?

What exactly can the fans expect from one of your shows?

583
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,700
Well, on the most shows, I do have a list against you, sir.

584
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,700
I'm doing a very good friend of mine.

585
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,700
So we do the lesbian shows.

586
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,700
Oh, nice.

587
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,700
So everything.

588
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:07,700
And we do sign names and they can take pictures with us.

589
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,700
It's a beautiful thing.

590
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,700
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.

591
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,700
Have you had a party?

592
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,700
Do you have any new movies coming out soon?

593
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Or did anything that's that shot that still has to be released?

594
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,700
Or do you have any plans?

595
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Yes.

596
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,700
Everything will come on on my new site.

597
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,700
Bobbyeeterlife.com.

598
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,700
Oh.

599
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,700
And so I've been shooting a shooting and shooting.

600
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,700
But there's nothing else that's with my new books on video.

601
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
Oh, that's cool.

602
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,700
We get to see it.

603
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,700
The new boobs, right?

604
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,700
Yeah.

605
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,700
We see.

606
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,700
Yeah.

607
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,700
So are these your own productions or are these, yeah?

608
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,700
Yeah.

609
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,700
Okay.

610
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
Have you ever worked for vivid entertainment?

611
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,700
No.

612
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,700
No.

613
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,700
No.

614
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,700
I have so many many costumes for them.

615
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,700
Mm-hmm.

616
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,700
But I never, no, I never did something for them.

617
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,700
No, because, you know, the house that we're in now here in the Hollywood Hills,

618
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,700
the Hilltop Watch Tower, Crackpot Command Center, apparently has been featured in many vivid entertainment

619
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,700
productions.

620
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,700
I'm just trying to find out which ones and I was, you know, had this.

621
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,700
The only certificate ones or the other ones, too, because maybe I've done something.

622
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,700
I mean, your house already.

623
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,700
I know.

624
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,700
Bobby, have you come by?

625
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,700
Hey, I know this place.

626
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,700
I know.

627
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,700
I have been over here.

628
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,700
I don't know if it's specifically vivid.

629
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
The neighbors weren't that clear about it.

630
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,700
But, well, because it's always secretly there.

631
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,700
Extremely.

632
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,700
Extremely.

633
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,700
Well, and then they always say, please just park the car somewhere else.

634
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,700
Yeah, park it.

635
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,700
Yeah, park it.

636
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,700
Oh, all the inside secrets to the adult film industry.

637
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,700
Right now.

638
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Extremely.

639
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
Everybody, I love it.

640
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,700
Well, we certainly look forward to welcoming you here to the studio in a couple of weeks

641
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,700
time when you're on your holiday.

642
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,700
And maybe we can do a little interview from the hot tub out here on the deck.

643
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,700
Of course.

644
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
Oh, I'm such a lucky bag.

645
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,700
Oh, wait.

646
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,700
You don't make it.

647
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
Of course.

648
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
Are you kidding?

649
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,700
Yeah.

650
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,700
I've been working out.

651
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,700
I've got them on this program.

652
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,700
Yeah.

653
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,700
I've had them on the three-byte.

654
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,700
It's a long story.

655
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,700
But it's three months.

656
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,700
And then I get a special prize.

657
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,700
It's, I'll tell you when you're here.

658
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,700
Oh.

659
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,700
Yeah.

660
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,700
Oh, I'm curious.

661
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,700
Something you might be curious now.

662
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,700
So Bobby, well, are you,

663
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,700
as an in-special preparations or any exercises you're doing to get ready for you?

664
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,700
I'm training my job.

665
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,700
All right.

666
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Well, we will certainly be rooting for a team orange for the Netherlands.

667
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,700
I've changed my stance now.

668
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,700
I go orange all the way.

669
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:40,700
And on Monday, I guess we'll figure out exactly where and how we can collect once

670
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,700
you post this either on on your Twitter, which is at Bobby Eden or Bobby Eden.

671
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,700
Bobbi EdenLive.com is at our.nl. What is it?

672
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,700
It's dot com.

673
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Dot com.

674
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,700
Great.

675
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Bobby, it's been a pleasure talking to you as always.

676
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,700
And well, I hope you, I hope you make it through next week.

677
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,700
It's going to be a rough one.

678
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,700
I just go for the next team.

679
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,700
The greats, Bobbi Eden, everybody, right here.

680
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
I know you're just stream.com and dailysourcecode.com.

681
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Thank you.

682
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:26,700
You know that it would be untrue.

683
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,700
You know that I would be alive.

684
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,700
If I was to say...

685
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,700
You know that it would be untrue.

686
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,700
You know that I would be alive.

687
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,700
If I was to say...

688
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,700
You know that it would be untrue.

689
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:58,700
You know that it would be untrue.

690
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:03,700
If I was to say...

691
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,700
To you...

692
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,700
Girl, we couldn't get my try out.

693
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,700
Come on, baby life out out out out out out.

694
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:17,700
There's no time to follow in the Maya.

695
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,700
Now that we can only lose

696
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,700
And I love become a funeral fire.

697
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

698
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,700
Come on baby, light fire.

699
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Try to set the light on fire, no.

700
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

701
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

702
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

703
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:03,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

704
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

705
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:18,700
Where you know that it would be a truth.

706
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,700
And you know that I would be alive.

707
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,700
If I was to go and tell you,

708
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:32,700
Mama, we couldn't get much higher.

709
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,700
Here come on baby, light fire.

710
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

711
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

712
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Come on baby, light fire.

713
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,700
Come on baby, light fire, no.

714
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,700
Come on baby, light fire.

715
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,700
Where you know that it's all right.

716
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,700
Come on baby, light fire fire fire.

717
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,700
Come on baby, light fire fire.

718
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,700
And girl, girl, you better

719
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,700
Light my fire with you

720
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,700
You better light

721
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,700
You better light

722
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,700
You better light

723
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,700
You better light my fire

724
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,700
And we're gonna get my child

725
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,700
Oh, come on there

726
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,700
Jose Fili Siano, light my fire

727
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,700
You know, I, before I ever heard the door's version

728
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,700
I heard this one

729
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,700
I remember my dad singing this

730
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,700
As he played guitar at home

731
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,700
It's just so beautiful

732
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,700
And once again, thanks to adult superstar Bobby Eden

733
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,700
for giving the exclusive interview to the Data Source Code

734
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,700
in No Agenda stream audience

735
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,700
And it really is true

736
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,700
She was being hounded by media all over

737
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,700
Gitmo Nation lowlands

738
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,700
And she decided

739
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,700
No, I'm not gonna give it to those guys

740
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
They're never there when I need some promotion

741
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,700
So and by the way

742
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
Probably the most listened to

743
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,700
Data Source Code episode ever

744
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,700
Which kind of gives you food for thought of working

745
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,700
Doing the right thing by playing just music here

746
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,700
Or maybe we need to do more porn stars

747
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,700
You know, it's a thought

748
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,700
I went to a garden party

749
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,700
To reminisce with my old friends

750
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,700
The chance to share old memories

751
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,700
Play a songs again

752
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,700
When I got to the garden party

753
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,700
They all knew my name

754
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,700
No one recognized me

755
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,700
I didn't look the same

756
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,700
But it's all right now

757
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,700
I learned my lesson well

758
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,700
You see it?

759
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,700
You can't please everyone

760
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,700
So you've got to please yourself

761
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,700
People came for miles around

762
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,700
Everyone was there

763
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,700
You'll go abroad

764
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,700
There was magic in the air

765
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,700
And over in the corner

766
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,700
Watched to my surprise

767
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,700
The stir Hughes hidden Dylan shoes

768
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,700
Wearing his disguise

769
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,700
But it's all right now

770
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,700
Learn my lesson well

771
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,700
You see it?

772
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,700
Can't please everyone

773
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,700
So you've got to please yourself

774
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,700
Let it stand down

775
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,700
Let it stand down

776
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,700
Played them all the old songs

777
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,700
But that's why they came

778
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,700
No one heard the music

779
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,700
We didn't look the same

780
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,700
I said hello to Mary Lou

781
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,700
She belongs to me

782
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,700
And it's saying a song about a song

783
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,700
It was time to leave

784
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,700
But it's all right now

785
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,700
I learned my lesson well

786
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,700
You see it?

787
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,700
Can't please everyone

788
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,700
So you've got to please yourself

789
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,700
Let it stand down

790
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,700
Let it stand down

791
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,700
Someone opened up

792
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,700
A closet door

793
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,700
And outstep the journey be good

794
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Laying guitar like a ring in a bell

795
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,700
And looking like a shoe

796
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,700
You've got to play garden parties

797
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,700
I wish you a lot of luck

798
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,700
But it's memories

799
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,700
You're all I sang

800
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,700
I'd rather drive a truck

801
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,700
But it's all right now

802
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,700
I learned my lesson well

803
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,700
You see it?

804
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,700
Can't please everyone

805
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,700
So you've got to please yourself

806
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Let it stand down

807
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,700
See I got to give you guys a little bit of musical education

808
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
Because they don't make songs like this

809
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,700
anymore

810
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,700
Ricky Nelson

811
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,700
Father to the Nelson twins

812
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,700
If you remember those blond ambition boys

813
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,700
All right now

814
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,700
They had a couple hits in there

815
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,700
I think they were very early 90s

816
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,700
And he Nelson then

817
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,700
He was quite a rebel in his time

818
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,700
Unfortunately he passed away in a plane crash

819
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,700
And the story goes that they were free-basing cocaine

820
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,700
And then the cabin of the plane caught on fire

821
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,700
Hey man if you got to go you might as well go down in flames

822
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,700
You know what I'm saying?

823
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,700
All right

824
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,700
They don't play this on the radio

825
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,700
I guarantee you that

826
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,700
It's too long

827
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,700
And too sexy

828
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,700
We want you to have a real good chance

829
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,700
Because that's just what we have in mind

830
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,700
Is that all right with you?

831
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,700
Now this is a tool that I can hold

832
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,700
And it's called tonight

833
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,700
Is the night

834
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,700
That you make me want

835
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,700
Now I never intended recording the song

836
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,700
It was a personal point

837
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,700
That isn't till the day that my producer

838
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,700
Happened to throw through the pages of my notebook

839
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,700
He came across the words and he said

840
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,700
We got to do something with these words

841
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,700
It's happening every day

842
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,700
And people want to hear about it

843
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,700
Benny

844
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,700
You see

845
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,700
It's the story

846
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,700
Of a young girl

847
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,700
Making love

848
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,700
For the very first time

849
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,700
Now

850
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,700
When I finally got a melody

851
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,700
I took it home and I

852
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,700
I played it for my mother

853
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,700
I got to tell you a little bit about my mother

854
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,700
You see I come from one of those pretty large families

855
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,700
And I'm the baby of the family

856
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,700
And you know you never grow up to your mother

857
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,700
I never forget the way she looked at me

858
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,700
When I played it for as she said

859
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,700
I like the music

860
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,700
You know baby

861
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,700
The melody is really nice

862
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,700
But I know you're not going to sing that song

863
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,700
But you used to write all that

864
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,700
And if it came one of my biggest records to me

865
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,700
So I want you to do this for me if you will

866
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,700
Every night

867
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,700
Think back

868
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:59,700
To your very first time

869
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Now give it a little while longer

870
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,700
Because I know some of you have to think back a little bit further than others

871
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,700
Come on now

872
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,700
Won't you play ketchup

873
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,700
And I don't want you wait till I get to give it a massage for you

874
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,700
Oh yeah now

875
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,700
And now

876
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,700
Now

877
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,700
Whether it was good

878
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,700
Or you just smile

879
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,700
And it was good

880
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,700
Or on the other hand

881
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,700
If it was not so good

882
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,700
Here's my stone

883
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,700
Tonight is the night

884
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,700
That you

885
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,700
Make me a warm mind

886
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,700
You said you bitchin' on me

887
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,700
And I hope you leave

888
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
I'm nervous

889
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,700
And I'm trembling

890
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,700
I'm waiting for you to walk in

891
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,700
I'm trying hard to relax

892
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,700
But I just can't keep still

893
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,700
No

894
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,700
I can't get your car to stand

895
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:37,700
I won't play bigger and put all this success man

896
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:42,700
But I know so little about what love is

897
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,700
I just can't help acting like a child

898
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,700
And I can't do my job

899
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,700
And you're ringing my bell

900
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,700
Hope you're not impatient

901
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,700
After waiting so very long

902
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,700
Or hold me up for you

903
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
With my silly hands

904
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,700
And we're both going up to know

905
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,700
I don't know

906
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,700
Tonight is the night

907
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,700
That you

908
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,700
Make me a warm mind

909
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,700
You said you bitchin' on me

910
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,700
And I hope you leave

911
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,700
I'm nervous

912
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,700
And I'm trembling

913
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:34,700
I'm waiting for you to walk in

914
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,700
I'm trying hard to relax

915
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:41,700
But I just can't keep still

916
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,700
No

917
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,700
I can't get your car to stand

918
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,700
I won't play bigger and put all this success

919
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,700
I won't play bigger and put all this success

920
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,700
But I know so little about what love is

921
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,700
I just can't help acting like a child

922
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,700
And I hope you're not impatient

923
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,700
I won't play bigger and put all this success

924
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,700
I just can't help acting like a child

925
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,700
And I hope you leave

926
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,700
I'm trying hard to relax

927
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,700
And I hope you leave

928
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,700
I can't just do it what we are doing

929
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,700
Not only will I never realize

930
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,700
But my whole family relationship

931
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,700
It'll all be ruined

932
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:26,700
I'm only going into my land

933
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,700
All to turn around

934
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,700
So let's just pray

935
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,700
I truly love this world without

936
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,700
I just can't help

937
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,700
Tonight

938
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,700
Tonight

939
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,700
Tonight

940
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,700
Oh, I'll never forget

941
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,700
Tonight

942
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,700
No, no, I'll never forget

943
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,700
Tonight

944
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,700
That's what you made me feel

945
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,700
You made me feel

946
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,700
You made me feel

947
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,700
You made me feel

948
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,700
You made me feel

949
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh

950
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,700
Yeah, I won't play bigger and put all this success

951
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,700
I just can't help acting like a child

952
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,700
And put all this success

953
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,700
I just can't help acting like a child

954
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,700
But I know so little about what love is

955
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,700
And I know it might be too much

956
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,700
I just can't help it

957
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,700
Because I love you

958
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,700
Baby

959
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,700
And I need you

960
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,700
Baby

961
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:36,700
I want you

962
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,700
My love, my love

963
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,700
My love, my baby

964
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,700
I'll never forget

965
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,700
Tonight

966
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,700
No, I'll never forget

967
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,700
Tonight

968
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,700
That's what you made me feel

969
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,700
You made me feel

970
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,700
You made me feel

971
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,700
You made me feel

972
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,700
You made me feel

973
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,700
You made me feel

974
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:01,700
You made me feel

975
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,700
You made me feel

976
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:10,700
You made me feel

977
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:15,700
You made me feel

978
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:24,700
You made me feel

979
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:54,300
Yeah, I love seeing the chat room, everyone talking about their very first time.

980
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:02,700
I remember mine, 15. My friends, girlfriend, with his permission.

981
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:14,700
Patty, tonight is the night. Hey, I had some great great ink on Wednesday and USA today.

982
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:20,700
A little bit thank God for no agenda, no agenda show also for the daily source code,

983
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:26,700
which is great, which is why I think we're seeing a larger quorum today on the stream than usual.

984
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,700
Of course, everyone's got the epoch and no agenda app as well.

985
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:34,700
And don't forget, we have the new daily source code app, I'll put a link in the show notes and no agenda.

986
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,700
DailySourceCode.com.

987
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:49,700
But also for the big app show, and I got to tell you the plan that I set out for myself for the future for the next five to ten years is actually starting to happen.

988
01:12:49,700 --> 01:13:00,700
So incredibly, I got to say I'm proud of myself in a way, but also just really happy when things are kind of in synchronicity and rolling along exactly the way I wanted them to.

989
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:04,700
And that was a great boost for people grabbing the app.

990
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:13,700
Now a lot of you listen to the show or techies and a lot of the apps, I'm not really, I'm not doing reviews, it's just a show and I'm just trying to build an audience.

991
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:21,700
It turns out that 65, I say, maybe even more now at this point, 65% of the audience at least is female.

992
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:35,700
And I'd say, between 20 and 40, and they really love it because they don't want to wrestle through all the game ratings in the app store, which of course it is.

993
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:42,700
And by the way, Apple had some actual proof of that taking place with the rogue developer who is kind of unclear how he did it.

994
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:48,700
But I guess he stole some accounts or a whole bunch of him and started knocking his stuff up the charts.

995
01:13:48,700 --> 01:14:01,700
So I don't have that type of capability nor what I want to do with that way, but instead of donating for the daily source code and for today's show, I'd like you to go out and promote the big app show.

996
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:11,700
And really, Twittering, putting it on your blog, if you put something on your blog, let me know about it and then I'll retweet that with the link.

997
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:22,700
Because this thing is started. It's on the verge of going viral. I'm seeing about a thousand people a day adding it to their downloads. It's a free app, but it really trust me when I tell you.

998
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:29,700
And you should never trust someone who says, trust me. But in this case, trust me when I tell you if this thing really can take off the way I wanted to.

999
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:40,700
I could do three source codes a day. I could quit everything else and just roll on and do this and we could have a lot of fun and we could play all of the songs that you want all by request.

1000
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,700
All for free.

1001
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:48,700
So I'm asking you to help me. I hope brother up, will you help me promote this thing, the big app show.

1002
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:56,700
And the best link to use is the bitley link, which is bit.ly slash big app show.

1003
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,700
The part of the airways is landed and he's sounding good to me.

1004
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,700
This is the day he saw Scott with Adam Curry.

1005
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:31,700
But still I take down those.

1006
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:38,700
Because all I need is blood and sweat and skin and bones.

1007
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:46,700
I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste? Nobody said it, it's easy to tell.

1008
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:51,700
Because all I need is blood and bones.

1009
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1010
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1011
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:02,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1012
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:07,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1013
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1014
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1015
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:22,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1016
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:28,700
And I'll take this phrase, where's all your taste?

1017
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:37,700
I want you to walk this point to you right back in your legs

1018
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:44,700
I'll take you down and like that smile out of your face

1019
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:48,700
I want you to break your mind to take

1020
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:54,700
Don't break you just like this, it's all on that beach

1021
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:00,700
Now we're left to run, I'm ready for the next fight

1022
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,700
To bring you in the world right

1023
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:08,700
Let me hear you speak as you are this

1024
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:12,700
Let me hear you, you like to be this

1025
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,700
If you've got a no-go, no-go, no-go, no-go

1026
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:21,700
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll be you

1027
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:29,700
Let me hear you, you like to be this

1028
01:17:51,700 --> 01:18:01,700
Let me hear you, you like to be this

1029
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,700
Leave that you in the world right back in your legs

1030
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,700
Let me hear you, you like to be this

1031
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:15,700
If you've got a no-go, no-go, no-go, no-go, no-go

1032
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:29,020
You don't have a trickle of what's coming out of your ears yet.

1033
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,860
You're doing something wrong.

1034
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,180
Ozzy, let me hear you scream on the stream.

1038
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:51,700
When you hold on the reins as we talk you out of pain

1039
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,700
And above the law once you were started to have faith

1040
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:59,700
What now will it take for us to never?

1041
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,700
This is not a test or never

1042
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,700
This is party at the rest of the world

1043
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,700
Still proud to admit our mistakes

1044
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,700
Kissing the bread and thus we all fall from grace

1045
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:25,700
This isn't just a sad thing straight

1046
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,700
To bring a break the rules back into place

1047
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,700
There is no middle ground

1048
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,700
It's no compromise with your heart and heart

1049
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,700
With perfect faith

1050
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,700
We spend back and broke this land

1051
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,700
It's breaking the soul, it's impossible

1052
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:43,700
And life's still out of the task to touch again

1053
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:46,700
And hope that it stays there

1054
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:56,700
on the reins as we talk you out of pain

1055
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,700
But proud to admit our mistakes

1056
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:04,700
Kissing the bread and thus we all fall from grace

1057
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,700
This isn't a sad thing straight

1058
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:13,700
To bring a break the rules back into place

1059
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,700
They can't cause the struggle cause our human way, you're not there

1060
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,700
Find a tunnel way

1061
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,700
That's how we'll never know

1062
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,700
This is not a test or not

1063
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,700
This is party at the rest of the house

1064
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,700
They'll come through and make our mistakes

1065
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,700
The class city is in the middle of the house

1066
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1067
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,700
Rise against appeal to reason

1068
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,700
Collapse, post America

1069
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,700
Well, everybody's well

1070
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,700
Can you with one more while we're at it?

1071
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,700
The message is in the music as always

1072
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,700
That's why you don't hear that shit on the radio

1073
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,700
Wouldn't want the sleeves to get all up any in shit

1074
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,700
Now we're with it

1075
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:55,700
Uh-uh

1076
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,700
Well, that'll be wrong

1077
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:01,700
But a frame sells firing and making for ourselves the ones

1078
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,700
Crazy

1079
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,700
Revolution calling

1080
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,700
I hear it

1081
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,700
All right, all right

1082
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,700
Will you accept it that we are that you're not there

1083
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,740
It's not a deceit

1084
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:30,720
I hate our WOODRUFF

1085
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,380
You're a whitty

1086
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:34,060
I'm afraid of theに

1087
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,620
We'll try to reverse the

1088
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,700
Right preview

1089
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:44,700
Just wash the television, you'll see that something's broken off

1090
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:51,700
God no death for politicians, all that crazy scene in DC

1091
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:57,700
It's just a power metal, but the time is right for changes

1092
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,700
There's a problem for you, that you didn't change the song

1093
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:03,700
You've got to be, you've got to be, you've got to steal

1094
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:07,700
I used to trust the meaning of the time in the flow

1095
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:14,700
There was no one, but now I see the pain of everything I knew

1096
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:18,700
Only it's what's with everything from someone

1097
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:25,700
I've got to be, you've got to be, you've got to be, you've got to be

1098
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:29,700
There's a man, I've got to be, you've got to be, you've got to be

1099
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:33,700
God no death for politicians, all that crazy scene in the flow

1100
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:38,700
I've got to be, you've got to steal

1101
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,700
Well, I'm tired of all this bullshit, baby

1102
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:48,700
Telling me, don't you beat up by the Communist man

1103
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:53,700
And no shady preachers, back and follow cash

1104
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,700
Just make your calls, while giving us everything

1105
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,700
Every time they're all in the house now

1106
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,700
We're more macacy, million dollar stories to tell

1107
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:07,700
I can't go, I'm losing my own city

1108
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,700
We've been in the snow, and I've got to choose

1109
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,700
If everybody's making the same story

1110
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,700
That all of it is the same, but all of it is the same

1111
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:22,700
We're all right, but now I only got the rules

1112
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:26,700
I have my mind is hurt, you've got to be, you've got to be, you've got to be

1113
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:32,700
I've got to ride a proud truck for the nation

1114
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,700
I've got to be!

1115
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,700
I've got to be a proud truck for the nation

1116
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,680
I've got to be

1117
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,200
羞espace, see me before we forgive

1118
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:26,700
You're the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the

1119
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:49,700
only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who having the name of the life that I have and he's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only kind who's the only one who's the only one who is the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's the only one who's wrong.

1120
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:25,300
As a revolution is calling, and that call has your name on it.

1121
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:31,300
Now, everybody listening on your iPhone, or out of their portable MP3 device, I want you

1122
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:37,100
to very carefully lift up your earbuds on the left hand side there, and stick your finger

1123
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,100
in your ear.

1124
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,100
Now, do you feel some wetness?

1125
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,100
No?

1126
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:47,420
Well, then you're not doing it right, because your ear should be kind of starting to bleed

1127
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,420
by now.

1128
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:53,620
If what, let's see if we can park them up a little bit with the brush.

1129
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:47,020
Never got closer to these, my family married me right back to phase 2, never the time and

1130
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:54,020
We burn the meat now, all the way

1131
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,020
By the way, we're inside

1132
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,020
We've got this man

1133
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:05,020
And we're going to the old days, all the way

1134
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,020
Pulling the ends again and again

1135
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,020
Swap the wings down the area

1136
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:11,020
I've got your body in me

1137
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,020
All night in each race

1138
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,020
You get your day on

1139
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:19,020
We're all in change, you think that

1140
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:24,020
The birth and time and truth

1141
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,020
We'll hear the stars change

1142
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:30,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1143
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:33,020
For the best

1144
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:48,020
We'll hear the stars change

1145
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:52,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1146
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:56,020
For the best, we'll hear the stars

1147
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:00,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1148
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:04,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1149
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:08,020
For the best, we'll hear the stars

1150
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:11,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1151
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:14,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1152
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1153
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:23,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1154
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1155
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:27,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1156
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:30,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1157
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:33,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1158
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1159
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,020
Young the way, we'll hear the stars

1160
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:43,020
I'm sitting on the rail, the only stop for the best

1161
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:48,020
Just run the train to think out

1162
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,020
I'm on the train and it's great

1163
01:29:54,020 --> 01:30:02,020
We'll have to stop sitting on the rail, the only stop for the best

1164
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:14,020
Yeah, light up that tire stick baby rush, a passage to Bangkok

1165
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:21,020
And well, I can hardly believe it, but the chat room is almost committing mutiny now if I don't play this song

1166
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:42,020
I tell you I'm in bed, you win so soon, so make sure to take it to me

1167
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:52,020
The pleasure is to play, play the different ones you say

1168
01:30:55,020 --> 01:31:02,020
I'm the chase queen, the only god I've seen is the ace of space, the ace of space

1169
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:12,020
Play the whole lot, well, catch it with the devil, start with the flow, it's all against me

1170
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:23,020
So I'm on the rail, the snake has watching you know

1171
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:32,020
The devil has a great, those takers play, the ace of space, the ace of space

1172
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:45,020
You know I'm going to lose, I got wins with rules, the next way I like it baby

1173
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:53,020
I'm one little forever, I don't think it's a joke

1174
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:25,020
I'm the chase queen, the only god I've seen is the ace of space, the ace of space

1175
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:55,020
