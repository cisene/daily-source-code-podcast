00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,200
All right, as promised, we've got a special guest on today's Daily Source Code.

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,200
First time we've actually turned the Hilltop Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center Studio

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:34,200
into something that actually kind of resembles, kind of like a studio, I guess.

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
A little bit.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
You back and forth, welcome.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Hi, thanks.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Hey, man.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Oh, hold on me.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Let me, uh, let me, uh, just take a wee bit of off for a second.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,200
It's a little weird when we're talking when you got nothing but reverb.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,200
So you, um, actually, uh, I met through, uh, your sister who was working for, uh, for

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Mickey and San Francisco said, uh, you know, she's like totally hawk and you're totally

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
plugging the shit out of your stuff.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Like, oh, you got to listen to CD is really good.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,200
And then, uh, and so, uh, me can't listen to, I was like, wow, this guy's really huge.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Are you sure he's Dutch?

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
It's like, and the first thing I noticed, man, is your accent is, is impeccable.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,200
I mean, you can almost can't tell your Dutch.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Right, do I can?

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
But, uh, no, yeah, true, true.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
So where did you learn to speak with such a great American accent?

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Uh, TV.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Just, we just come a little bit closer to the mic because I can't, it's hard for me to work

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
the board and everything all the same time.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
I only have two hands and, you know, I got to smoke as well.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Um, so now, uh, your, uh, professional musician as in, you do this for a living.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I do.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
I do.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
And, uh, you're living in the Netherlands, but thinking of maybe giving it a try over here

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
in the States.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Uh, I'm fan-to-planning it, fan-to-sizing and planning it.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Okay.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Good.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
It's like a little recon mission.

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,200
And then Mickey actually asked you to come and perform at an art expo that she was doing in Amsterdam.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,200
And I was like, and he had, uh, three guys, right?

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Yeah.

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Or was it just one other guy?

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I had one friend of mine with me in a percussion player from Venezuela.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Uh, we've been friends for some time and, uh, you know,

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
whenever I can, I hire him.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
He was just like banging on some piece of wood like he was sitting on a box, you know.

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,200
It's called a cahoon and it's, uh, replaces a full drum kit basically and you play.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Really?

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
You play with two hands, it's got a little snare inside, so it sounds like a kid.

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
I have two cahoones.

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Is that kind of the same thing?

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
One cahoon, two cahoones?

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Yeah, you need big cahoones.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,200
So you don't have, uh, any percussion with you today?

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
No, it's just me.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
And, uh, you've got your fender, uh, strata cast right in my point out.

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Uh, you've got it.

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
What kind of gear?

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Because we're plugged directly into the board here, what you got?

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Yes.

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,200
I brought a little line six device called the, uh, the pocket pod,

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
which is the smallest version of the, of the line six pod.

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Uh-huh.

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
So it fits in my gig back, so.

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Cool.

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
So when you perform, what do you do?

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Your own stuff?

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Do you do covers?

66
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Uh, basically I pay what people want and I smile when they pay me.

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:00,200
It's a real treat to have you here, because I think you're a phenomenal musician.

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Thank you.

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
And, uh, you know, I've been trying over the, you know, past day trying to, like, kind

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,200
of spury on that just, uh, give up the lowlands and come over here and, uh,

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
and give it a shot, man, because you, you got a lot of talent, and I think, uh,

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
when people hear this, they'll really, really enjoy what you're doing.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Thank you.

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
And, uh, so what are you going to do?

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Yeah, I'd love you just to play as much as you feel like playing, because this is, uh,

76
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
you know, we don't have to, like, hit the network news or anything on the show.

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Yeah.

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
So, uh, what would you like to do?

79
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I was thinking of, uh, mixing it up, playing a few covers, um, you know,

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,200
some well-known stuff, and maybe a few originals as well, just, uh, you know.

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Okay.

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Let me, yeah.

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Just give me a little vocal here, so I can set your reverb back.

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay.

85
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Go ahead.

86
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Hey.

87
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Mmm.

88
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Mmm.

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
That's for you.

90
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Nice.

91
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
All right.

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
You better come on.

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Take it away, man.

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Say the joke or to the thief.

95
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,200
There's too much confusion.

96
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I can't get no relief.

97
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Business man, they drink my wine.

98
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Plow and dig my earth.

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
No, them down the line.

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Not any other word, no.

101
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,200
No reason to get excited, no, no, no.

102
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,200
The thief you kind of spoke.

103
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,200
There are many here on my nerves.

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Who know the life is just a joke.

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
But you will not weave Ben through that, yes.

106
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,200
And this is not our fate, no, no.

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,200
So little, snotspeak falls in our arms.

108
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Who's the hours getting lay, yeah.

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Yeah.

110
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Along the watch style.

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Princess kept you.

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
While all the women came and went.

113
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,200
They're for serving too.

114
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Outside in the cold distance.

115
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
While can't get grow.

116
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
To run his reproaching.

117
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,200
And the wind, the wind began to haunt.

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Along the watch style.

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Along the watch style.

120
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Along the watch style.

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Along the watch style.

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:46,200
And of course, you played my theme song here in the watch tower.

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I love it, man.

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
It's awesome.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I just realized we got an audience here.

126
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
But they only hear you singing.

127
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
You don't hear as guitar, right?

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
It's like, and it still sounds good.

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Dude, I was just thinking about this.

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
We got to do something about the name.

131
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
I want to make it here.

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
You could be like, what can we make it?

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,200
First of all, I was thinking of cutting off the Birkin and just going with Bosch because it's like a powerful like Bosch.

134
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Yeah.

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Although Birkin has a ring to it though.

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
It's like, you Birkin, you Bosch.

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Birkin stock.

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Yeah, you'll be big and Berkeley.

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Yes.

140
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Okay, we'll work on that.

141
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm sure some of the chuckle heads out there might have some ideas.

142
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
You want to play one of your own tunes?

143
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Absolutely.

144
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Alright, hold on.

145
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Go for it.

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,200
This is a song called Something Good.

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
All my life I've been on the run.

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Killing time getting nothing done.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I've spent so many nights on my own bed.

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I don't want to end up alone.

151
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Here the nose, the mistakes I've made.

152
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Here the nose, there'll be hell to pay.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,200
When I'm with you, I don't know what to say girl.

154
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I feel lost, I feel in the way.

155
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,200
All I do is think about it.

156
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Can't begin to live without it.

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Hold on to the love you're feeling inside.

158
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Baby, you need to get her.

159
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Could make it through this heavy weather.

160
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I'm not sure I did all that I could.

161
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

162
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Something good, but part of something good.

163
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Oh.

165
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Maybe you could take care of me.

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
You and my heart start a family.

167
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm afraid now this feeling's getting so strong.

168
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Need to find out where long goes.

169
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,200
All I do is think about it.

170
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Can't begin to live without it.

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Hold on to the love you're feeling inside.

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Baby, you need to get her.

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Could make it through this heavy weather.

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm not sure we did all that we could.

175
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

176
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Something good, but part of something good.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Oh, I do is think about it.

179
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Can't begin to live without it.

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Hold on to the love you're feeling inside.

181
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Baby, you need to get her.

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Could make it through this heavy weather.

183
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I'm not sure I did all that I could.

184
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

185
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Something good, but part of something good.

186
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

187
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Something good, but part of something good.

188
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I just want to be a part of something good.

189
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Something good.

190
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Dude, did you like come out of the womb with that voice and the chops like that?

191
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Just like born with it?

192
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Yeah, it's awesome.

193
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
That's a great song.

194
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
When do you write that?

195
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
About 2005, I think.

196
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Really?

197
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Go ahead and have a drink of water.

198
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I'll compliment you while you're doing that.

199
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I've been picking hit songs all my life on the radio.

200
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
That is definitely a hit.

201
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
That's a great song.

202
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
It's hokey, it's nice, it's what I think people are wanting to hear.

203
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
You got a record deal or anything like that?

204
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I got nothing.

205
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Yeah, it's talking musician.

206
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
We love it.

207
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Perfect.

208
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm basically playing tourist bars and Amsterdam doing cover stuff.

209
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,200
I play my own stuff whenever I can, but usually the bartenders like us to play.

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
The stuff that people know, so they buy more drinks, so the bartenders make more money.

211
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Right.

212
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
But yeah, I do a little gigs here and there with my own stuff.

213
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I've done a few bigger things.

214
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I was a finalist on a pretty big live music competition back home.

215
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah, what's that?

216
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
That's the Hrotoprace.

217
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
This is a sponsored by the government.

218
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
It's a cultural department of culture, prize or something.

219
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Yes, it's them in Hainick and I think.

220
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah, that's a Dutch government works with Hainick.

221
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Can you, of course, they do.

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
All right, cool.

223
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
All right.

224
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
And did that get you any traction?

225
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Did that work for you?

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
No, no.

227
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
No, no.

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
No, no.

229
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
And free beer.

230
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Well, I got, uh, there was like an events company out there.

231
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
They scattered me and they hired me for some cool stuff.

232
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Uh-huh.

233
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
For the world famous Johan Krav Foundation.

234
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Okay, sure.

235
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Stuff like that.

236
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Sure.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Got hired to do some promotional stuff for, you know.

238
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
But nothing, nothing serious.

239
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
So when you look at the music business today, I mean, what do you see the future?

240
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
What do you think you'll be doing and what, what approach you're taking?

241
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Because I presume you want to do this, right?

242
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
This is what, this is your passion, right?

243
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Oh, yeah.

244
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Well, I've recently got an in touch with some people back home that are wanting to help

245
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
me out.

246
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,200
There's like a small group of independent people that are trying to conquer the world, as

247
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
we're all trying to.

248
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Sure.

249
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,200
And what I really need right now is I still don't have a recording of my own

250
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
stuff that I'm, you know, fully happy with.

251
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
So that's the first thing I'm going to do when I go back home.

252
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Let's be pretty easy to find people who can know.

253
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I mean, these days with, you know, max and pro tools and everything that should be

254
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
reasonably easy.

255
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I mean, this will, this will be something you can enjoy listening to.

256
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I don't think it's exactly what you want from a demo.

257
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Not quite what you want.

258
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Well, with you on it, my hair.

259
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Well, do whatever we can.

260
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I'd love for you to do a song by request for me, because I heard you do this.

261
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Actually, I talked about this on the show a couple of weeks ago.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I heard you do this at the, at the art expo.

263
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
And I was like, oh my god, the first of all, the fact that anyone,

264
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
under 40 knows this song.

265
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Right.

266
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Second of all, would play it.

267
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I was like, it just blew me away.

268
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
It's a real mother for you.

269
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Johnny Guitar Watson was like, oh, yeah.

270
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I mean, if you always had this in your repertoire, pretty much.

271
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Johnny Guitar Watson is one of my favorite all-time artists.

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
What happened to him?

273
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Is he still alive?

274
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I think you had a heart attack in Japan on stage, actually.

275
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Really?

276
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And he passed away?

277
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
He died.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
What a way to go.

279
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Mid 90s.

280
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Yeah.

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
But it had like sparks coming out of the guitar.

282
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
That would have been even better.

283
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Go down in flames.

284
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah.

285
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
It's either on stage or in bed with a beautiful woman, right?

286
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
I mean, if you're going to get a heart attack, that's the way to go.

287
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Hear that, Mick?

288
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah.

289
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
So who are your heroes?

290
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Is Johnny Guitar Watson one of them?

291
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Uh, yes.

292
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Well, basically, I break my, my musical background down into like three components.

293
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Like, there's the stuff I grew up around because my parents had it,

294
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
owned it or listened to it.

295
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Right.

296
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Add the same, sure.

297
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
So that's what was that?

298
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
What kind of stuff was that?

299
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Uh, that's like the late 60s, early 70s rock.

300
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Okay.

301
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Cool.

302
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
You see, I grew up with like peppermint twist and crap like that.

303
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I know all the 50 songs.

304
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
No, no.

305
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
I was like, uh, yeah, I listened to Rolling Stones, Jimmy Hendrix.

306
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
All right.

307
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
That kind of stuff.

308
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Right.

309
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,200
And then, uh, when I was a teenager, I was, I was a big fan of Red Hot Chili

310
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Peppers, uh, stuff like that.

311
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Funky, funky stuff.

312
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
And then through the funk I discovered, you know, jazz through players like Marcus

313
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, Marcus.

314
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Sure, sure.

315
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah.

316
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Yeah.

317
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
And he mingus?

318
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah.

319
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah.

320
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah.

321
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
The whole, like, the real series, jazzy jazz stuff.

322
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Yes.

323
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Okay.

324
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Right.

325
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I mean, I love it, but I can't do it.

326
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
So stay away from requires actual talent.

327
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
And, and a lot of drugs, I think.

328
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Those guys must be way high to do that stuff.

329
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I think you have to be.

330
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Yeah.

331
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
How about Prince?

332
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You're a fan of Prince.

333
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Well, a huge fan of Prince.

334
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Okay.

335
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Yeah.

336
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
And that guy's amazing.

337
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Yeah.

338
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Yeah.

339
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Yeah.

340
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Everybody says you're genius.

341
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
But he actually is.

342
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah.

343
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
All right.

344
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,200
One by a new car.

345
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Both the pricing and the right.

346
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Be a downside cheaper.

347
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Here's the woo.

348
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Start right in the bike.

349
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,200
The making milk out of powder.

350
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Got the biggest crime.

351
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
The rent's gone up higher.

352
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Long, long, long.

353
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Got the parents' line.

354
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Get to room for the foil.

355
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Make you want to run for color.

356
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,200
And if you look, you will discover.

357
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Get to room for the foil.

358
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Get to room for the foil.

359
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Got to go to a disco.

360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,200
And throw your troubles away.

361
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Got to dance, dance to the music and baby.

362
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,200
That's a DJ play.

363
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
But then the lights come on, alone.

364
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Just like a new day would.

365
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Like a new day would.

366
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
You go home, face the music.

367
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,200
But don't sound too good, no.

368
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Get to room for the foil.

369
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Make you want to run for color.

370
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,200
And if you look, you will discover.

371
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Get to room for the foil.

372
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Get to room for the foil.

373
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Make you want to run for color.

374
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,200
And if you look, you will discover.

375
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Get to room for the foil.

376
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Get to room for the foil.

377
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Get to room for the foil.

378
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Get to room for the foil.

379
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Oh man.

380
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
You got to let your own percussion.

381
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Everything going on there.

382
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
The same time is great.

383
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
It was tricky.

384
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,200
And do you consider yourself more a guitarist play a singer or a combo?

385
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Generally, I try to stay away from the whole singer songwriter thing, which is technically what I am.

386
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
People kind of turn that into a genre.

387
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Yeah, like jewel.

388
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Right, even though it's more of a job description.

389
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Technically, Jimmy Hendrix was a singer songwriter.

390
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Oh, hell yeah.

391
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
No, I see.

392
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm a guitarist singer singer.

393
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Yeah.

394
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
You got to look though, man.

395
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I think you know, you do something with like, I don't know.

396
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
What do you wear on stage?

397
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Jeans and shirts.

398
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Girls, we need to give this guy a look.

399
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Yeah, you got it in you know, you really do.

400
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Thank you.

401
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
People usually say, I'm like, like Michael McDonald meets Eric Laptant type of thing.

402
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I don't know.

403
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Yeah, I can't see where that comes from.

404
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Yeah.

405
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Yeah.

406
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm not old.

407
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
No.

408
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
You're saying I don't know the compliment.

409
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
I'd love to hear some more of your own stuff.

410
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Sure, sure.

411
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Yeah.

412
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Go ahead and have some water there.

413
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Can I get some background vocals on this?

414
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
No, because because my sister's there, she knows the song.

415
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
But I can't say.

416
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Doesn't matter.

417
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
This is a, this is a song called, called You Should Be Here With Me.

418
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
And it does.

419
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I don't care.

420
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I don't care.

421
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
All right.

422
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
All right.

423
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
We're getting the whole family involved now.

424
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Exactly.

425
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,200
So if you just stand in behind me, but that'll be great.

426
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
No, a little closer.

427
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
We're going to be able to hear it.

428
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
All right.

429
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Well, it's, it's real simple.

430
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
All you have to do is sing along with me on the courses.

431
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
You should be here with me.

432
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
You know that song.

433
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Yeah, because this, this is the, the audience participation

434
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Proclamation song.

435
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Yeah.

436
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Doesn't work without.

437
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
All right.

438
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
So here we go.

439
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Here we go.

440
00:22:50,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm not sure if I remember

441
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Your pants are all your face

442
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:28,200
But I'm positive that no one could ever come and take your place

443
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I know you never meant to leave me stranded

444
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,200
You never planned to leave so soon

445
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,200
But I still sit around and picture

446
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,200
How you walk back into the room

447
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,200
People always talk about us

448
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Saying I would could have been so tight

449
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
The million words would never fix this no

450
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Because whatever they say, I still need you here tonight

451
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:16,200
You should be here with me

452
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,200
You should be here with me

453
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Not alone

454
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Little little only came and showed me

455
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Just what a man's supposed to be

456
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
And though you're on my started crackin

457
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,200
It still looks pretty good to me

458
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,200
I know you never meant to leave me stranded

459
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
You never planned to leave so soon

460
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,200
But I still sit around and picture

461
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,200
How you walk back into the room

462
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
People always talk about us

463
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Saying I would could have been so tight

464
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,200
The million words would never fix this no

465
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Whatever they say, I still need you here tonight

466
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Because you should be

467
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Here with me

468
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,200
You should be here with me

469
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Where could I want to?

470
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:51,200
You should be here with me

471
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,200
You should be here with me

472
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:05,200
You should be here with me

473
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,200
You should be here with me

474
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:22,200
You should be here with me

475
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,200
You should be here with me

476
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,200
You should be here with me

477
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
You should be here with me

478
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
You should be here with me

479
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,200
You should be here with me

480
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,200
You should be here with me

481
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,200
You should be here with me

482
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,200
You should be here with me

483
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
You should be here with me

484
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You should be here with me

485
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,200
You should be here with me

486
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
You should be here with me

487
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,200
You should be here with me

488
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,200
You should be here with me

489
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,200
You should be here with me

490
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,200
You should be here with me

491
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,200
You should be here with me

492
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:47,200
You should be here with me

493
00:27:47,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Oh, the love is real, when we touch I can't deny it, I listen with my skin, and that's when I begin to understand it.

494
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Your hands speak so true, mine could never reach for others, they would just reveal, a love that can't be real, because I love you.

495
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I need your touch so bad, only your hands can't reveal, I feel without you.

496
00:28:51,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Then I look for you as real, when you're gone, I ache baby, because I need you close to me, when I run and hide.

497
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:29,200
I need your touch so bad, only your hands can't reveal.

498
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:53,200
I know that love is real, when we touch I can't deny it, I listen with my skin, and that's when I begin to understand it.

499
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:17,200
When I am far away, and wake up to another dark day, you touch me and I know that I love you so, though I might not show it.

500
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I need your touch so bad, only your hands can't reveal, I feel without you.

501
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Then I look for you as real, when you're gone, I ache baby, because I need you close to me.

502
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:54,200
When I run and hide, need your touch so bad, only your hands can reveal.

503
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm sitting here, I'm listening with my eyes closed, I can't place your voice, it's really unique, and this is going to sound really weird, but the closest, does anyone ever compare you to anybody, they say you sound like,

504
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:21,200
everyone hates when you do that.

505
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:31,200
When they hear you do stuff, they want to give you compliments, so they like or know, so I usually get, oh, yeah, you have a beard and long hair and a guitar, so you're Eric Clapton,

506
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,200
you know you're John Legend, you know you're Michael McDonald, I get those are few names.

507
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:47,200
First of all, John Legend is our neighbor here, and he better watch his house, you'll be moving in, but I have to say a white Stevie Wonder.

508
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,200
I had my eyes closed, and it's meant as a compliment, obviously who can be Stevie Wonder, but you've got something,

509
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,200
and by the way, it was a beautiful, beautiful chord jazz, that's really, really nice stuff. Do you place Stevie Wonder, do you do any of his stuff?

510
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,200
I, yeah. I'm going to put you on the spot or anything.

511
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Actually, I used to do superstition.

512
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,200
That's really tricky with that percussion, but maybe some handclaps, we can make it happen.

513
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
How about some cowbell? How about some cowbell?

514
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Are you going to glue me into where we do the cowbell, no?

515
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Very superstitions.

516
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Riding's on the wall.

517
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Very superstitions.

518
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Letters bound to fall.

519
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,200
13 months old baby.

520
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Broken looking glass.

521
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,200
30 years of bed look.

522
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Good things in your past.

523
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:14,200
When you believe in things that you don't understand, you will suffer.

524
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Superstition in the way.

525
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Hit, hit, hit me.

526
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Very superstitions.

527
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Wash your face and hands.

528
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Read me over the problem.

529
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Do all that you can.

530
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Keep me in the dead dream.

531
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Keep me going strong.

532
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,200
You don't want to say me.

533
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Sad is my song.

534
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:08,200
When you believe in things that you don't understand, you will suffer.

535
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Superstition in the way.

536
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Very superstitions.

537
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Very superstitions.

538
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Nothing more to say.

539
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Very superstitions.

540
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
The devil's on his way.

541
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,200
13 months old baby.

542
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Broken looking glass.

543
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
7 years of bed look.

544
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Good things in your past.

545
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:20,200
When you believe in things that you don't understand, you will suffer.

546
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Superstition in the way.

547
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,200
I'm sorry.

548
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm trying to listen to the strings of the guitar.

549
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Now you know why I play the records, not make them.

550
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Do you want to do one more just to play his home, your favorite song?

551
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:11,200
One of my favorite songs has to be Marvin Gaseong.

552
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Baby, baby.

553
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Oh, I bet you wanted how I knew about your plans to make me bloom.

554
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,200
With so much God that you're new before.

555
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Dreaming to us, guys, you know I love you more.

556
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,200
You took me by surprise, I'm gonna say.

557
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,200
When I found out yesterday,

558
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine.

559
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,200
No much longer would you be mine.

560
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Said I heard through the grapevine.

561
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
And I'm just about to lose my mind.

562
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:36,200
How they hung it, yeah.

563
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Now I know the man that's supposed to cry,

564
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,200
But these tears I can't hold inside.

565
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I'm losing you when in my life you see.

566
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Because you mean that much to me.

567
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,200
And you could have told me yourself.

568
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,200
That you loved someone else.

569
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Instead, I heard through the grapevine.

570
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,200
No much longer would you be mine.

571
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Said I heard through the grapevine.

572
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,200
And I'm just about to lose my mind.

573
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,200
How they hung it, yeah.

574
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Now I know the man that's supposed to cry,

575
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,200
But these tears I can't hold inside.

576
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm just about to lose my mind.

577
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,200
And I'm just about to lose my mind.

578
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,200
And I'm just about to lose my mind.

579
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:15,200
People say they leave half of what you see.

580
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,200
You're son and none of what you hear.

581
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,200
But I can't help but be confused.

582
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,200
If it's true, won't you tell me, dear?

583
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,200
When you play and let me go.

584
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Follow the guy that you loved before.

585
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Don't you know that I heard through the grapevine.

586
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,200
No much longer would you be mine.

587
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Said I heard through the grapevine.

588
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,200
And I'm just about to lose my mind.

589
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:02,200
How they hung it, yeah.

590
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:11,200
How they hung it, I know that you let me go.

591
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Cause I heard it in the grapevine.

592
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Said I heard through the grapevine.

593
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Said I heard through the grapevine.

594
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Said I heard it through the grapevine.

595
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
All right, that's beautiful, man.

596
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
That's great.

597
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Thank you.

598
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
So I think I figured it out.

599
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I think it should be, I think you keep the Birkenboss.

600
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Just keep it like Birkenboss.

601
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Not Bosch because they can't figure that out here.

602
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
And they say, but you just gotta be John.

603
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Just John Birkenboss.

604
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I mean, it sounds good.

605
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,200
You know, it sounds like like you've got some years under your belt.

606
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,200
You know, you've been around the Mississippi Delta.

607
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
All right.

608
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm like that.

609
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
I'm just saying you see that wall there.

610
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
And this wall, this brick wall.

611
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Yeah.

612
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,200
So we got aerosmith, platinum CDs, Michael Jackson, platinum CDs.

613
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Next time you come back, we'll have the John Birkenboss CDs there.

614
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
That's a deal.

615
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Yeah.

616
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I mean, really appreciate it.

617
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
It's very cool for you to stop by and do this for us.

618
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
No, thank you so much.

619
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Yeah, you welcome.

620
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Anytime come back.

621
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
And anything we can do for you.

622
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Maybe people will be reaching out to who heard the show.

623
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Where can they reach in?

624
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Do you have email address?

625
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Uh, yes.

626
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,200
The easiest thing to do would be Google my name, which is J-O-E-P.

627
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Yep.

628
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,200
B-E-R-K-E-N-B-O-S-E-H.

629
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
And I got a dot com.

630
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
I'm on my space.

631
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm on Facebook.

632
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
All right, I'll put some links in the show notes as well.

633
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
DailySourceco.com.

634
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Some people can find you.

635
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,200
All right.

636
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
The great you back and bust everybody.

637
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Yay.

638
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Thank you.
