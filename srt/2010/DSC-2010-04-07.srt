00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Come on!

179
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Whoa, we can't sight at a strange face!

180
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A wings of a snake risk that's weak!

181
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We've been denying you, too!

182
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Still in a room without a few!

183
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We've got to know you've got to know!

184
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're going to say, go, go!

185
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And for bringing up for five to five!

186
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm going to pull over the furious five!

187
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That you must protect me!

188
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We don't need that Kingville break!

189
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's something must be done!

190
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've got things to break, and I've got to go!

191
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I've picked up my grip to stay in front of the system!

192
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will pull it over and you get so big!

193
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You get facing the face and I've got to stop really!

194
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't you worry about me!

195
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't you worry about me!

196
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's no death waiting for me!

197
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What is going on?

198
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why is the war going on?

199
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I've got no patience!

200
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm going to pull up for five to five!

201
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want you to run away.

202
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a war going on.

203
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've got enough grip for you in a��',

204
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've got enough grip for you in a그램!

205
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a war going on!

207
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

208
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The war I've got to stop is done again!

209
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've got everything to break!

210
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've got things to break, and I've got to stop with my grip!

211
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's speed rip until I cast out my fingers!

212
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I pour all that cash!

213
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now went to much� to take it!

214
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We don't need the key, we don't break it!

215
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Time is come to...

216
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Go your way!

217
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We don't need the key!

218
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We don't need the key!

219
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We don't need the key!

220
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We don't need the key!

221
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We don't need the key!

222
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We don't need the key!

223
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We don't need the key!

224
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We don't need the key!

225
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We don't need the key!

226
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We don't need the key!

227
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We don't need the key!

228
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We don't need the key!

229
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We don't need the key!

230
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We don't need the key!

231
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We don't break it!

232
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We don't need it!

233
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're in a beast!

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In the nit bits of blood to escape the fighting!

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We hold a fire, try this sırration!

236
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Somebody makes me thinker, anger!

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is washed by sea, brutality, the only one that could betray!

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All the which are already dead!

239
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Laura Merritt is dreams!

240
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:19,020
All the flicker,

241
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,220
Regents the Machine?

242
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,960
Before that DJ Lobster dust with Brooklyn rocks as you can tell there is some work going on here at the hilltop watch tower

243
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,880
and the people's Republic of Southern California. This actually is your donations at work

244
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,240
needed to have well, you know, we got kind of an older place that we're renting and need to patch up some stuff

245
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,520
So it doesn't fall down when the earthquake machine is flicked on in Southern California

246
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:57,920
That is handyman Daniel who didn't exactly have the schedule straight for the source code recordings and live streamings, but I guess we'll just have to live with it

247
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,420
Hey, it's kind of weird day today

248
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Today is my ex-wife's birthday

249
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:12,220
She turned 61 today and I was in this classic conundrum, you know, what do you do? And you've been on such a good vibe talking to each other and

250
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,220
Listen to that

251
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,220
You know communicating and getting our shits sorted out and I'm like, so what do you do? Do you call do you?

252
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:30,220
I don't think you should send a text message. That sounds kind of wrong. Do you send flowers and actually talked it over with Miss Mickey?

253
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,220
She says, yeah, totally you got to send flowers. So I did that and of course we have a nine hour time difference.

254
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,220
So I figured I just place a call over it and say, hey, you know, how you doing happy birthday

255
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,220
Her new boyfriend gave her a puppy, which was kind of funny because I know her and I said

256
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Are you happy with your present? She said well, I wasn't really expecting it

257
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Anyway, I said all the flowers arise is like what flowers? Oh, you know, I got so many flowers

258
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Didn't check all the cards yet, so I don't know. I don't didn't know you sent anything and oh, by the way, I'll have to call the journalist back

259
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:15,220
Who I just told you or total douche bag for not sending me anything nice. See that's how it goes. Some people just never change

260
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
That is worst code

261
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,220
I'm sure the vibrator will eventually switch off otherwise you have to pull the plug so we can chat

262
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,220
And we got some cool stuff to talk about today. So things going on talk about this opportunity and the new iPod

263
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
Why should I say I vote it?

264
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,220
The best word on the chart like people are people

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,220

The best word on the chart like people are people

291
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:41,100
The best mode to kick sass like it was yesterday and all right those guys like my age

292
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:49,500
I was looking in the mirror this morning, of course the Southern California weather is doing the well finally getting some vitamin D into my system

293
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,060
I feel like I still can't go on on there just from hanging out and

294
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:02,460
What happened? You know I look like I'm 29. I'm 45. I got to I got so much to do so many things to

295
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,300
To take care of so much so much saving to do and I'm not talking about money

296
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
Oh, yes

297
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,900
So some interesting things taken place actually I've reconnected with a couple of people here in Los Angeles

298
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,820
It's been really fun to be here and I'm kind of reaching out now going through the address book going through

299
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Years worth of email

300
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,340
Luckily all stored up in the Gmail account and

301
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,620
Re-sought to my buddy Rudy Sarzo the Cuban hurricane who's of course played bass with

302
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,020
You name it currently. He he's out on the road a lot with with Deo, but I didn't even know he was doing a couple of television shows

303
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,060
I guess he's on this thing called that metal show on

304
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,020
VH1 a Rudy is probably he's got to be hit in 50. I think he's older than I am

305
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,260
I hope I'm right. I don't know I got to check with him anyway

306
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
We you know it's like we picked up our conversation like we had just dropped it off yesterday

307
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,700
You'll probably remember he wrote a book about Randy Rhodes probably three years ago

308
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
and we highlighted it on the Charlie

309
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,100
Plugged it a little bit. I have no idea

310
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,500
Yeah, he's self-published. I think is what he wound up doing

311
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,140
Anyway, he's all there's also this new

312
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,580
Television project he's working on which sounds really exciting and hopefully when it catch up with him in person

313
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,820
There's apparently some major

314
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,780
Gathering some schmooze fest Thursday here at the Kodak theater

315
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,700
Which is all all the rock gods are getting back together again

316
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,140
So hopefully he's gonna get me and Mickey on the list and we'll go hang out and

317
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,940
Might be time to break out the old was it the I are

318
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,940
1999 as someone I got that thing around here somewhere. What is that to my little recorder?

319
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,580
I just mine have to do so work on the road again

320
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,700
So this week is all about getting reconnected

321
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,860
Might as well break out the song to celebrate

322
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,140
Stereo mc's as suggested

323
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Through Twitter Adam Curry

324
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Yeah

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
You got to do right

326
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,540
If you make sure you're connected

327
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
The right ends on the wall

328
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
If you make sure you're connected

347
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
The right ends on the wall

348
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,460
But if you're not neglected

349
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,620
Stumble your my boss

350
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,820
Stumble your my boss

351
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,860
Here we have

352
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,860
Stumble your my boss

353
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Yeah

354
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
And mistake the fire

355
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Stay in our life

356
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
You're someone trying

357
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Open up your eyes

358
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
I'm

359
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Too much better

360
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Like you can't see

361
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Okay

362
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
We are

363
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I want to do it again

364
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
I don't wanna do it again

365
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,860
I want to do it again

366
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
I want to do it again

367
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Hear me out

368
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I'm terrified

369
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Son of that right

370
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Here we go

371
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
If you make sure you're connected

372
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,860
The right ends on the wall

373
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
But if you're not neglected

374
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Stumble your my boss

375
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,860
Stumble your my boss

376
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,860
If you make sure you're connected

377
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
Stumble your my boss

378
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
But if you're gonna look at it,

379
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,860
Don't worry about it,

380
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
Don't worry about it,

381
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
If you're gonna look at it,

382
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Don't worry about it,

383
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Don't worry about it,

384
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,860
If you make sure you're directed

385
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,860
You're right in front of the wall,

386
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
But if you're gonna look at it,

387
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Don't worry about it,

388
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Don't worry about it,

389
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Don't worry about it,

390
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
You're gonna look at it,

391
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
I don't know man,

392
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Just always love that track,

393
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Stereo MCs,

394
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Make sure you are connected,

395
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Going out on the charcoal,

396
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
826.

397
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
Which of course is,

398
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
Doing a little slide in real time,

399
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
And you can know the general stream.com,

400
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
If you're listening,

401
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
You have the opportunity,

402
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
You can always hop on the chat room,

403
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
No agenda chat.com.

404
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,860
And of course

405
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,860
And we have a plethora of options for you to listen to, to listen to the show, of course.

406
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,860
If you actually, I should put those into the show notes for daily source code.

407
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,860
You can listen to the no agenda stream on a number of iPhone apps.

408
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Actually, we had our first iPad apps submitted the other day.

409
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:22,860
I think it should be through any moment now, which basically has the same functionality as the, as the iPhone version of it.

410
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:32,860
So that's full screen, because I kind of tell you these, these iPhone apps that run in kind of like miniature iPhone emulation on the iPad, it sucks.

411
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:38,860
It's really, it's not worth it. I'm amazed at how many developers are kind of behind on this.

412
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,860
Now, of course, I might, I will talk about that later, but my own iPhone app and the reason why it's going to be iPhone only at first.

413
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:56,860
You know, it's like I've been using simply tweet as, as my Twitter application on the iPhone, which I love, and I want them to use it on the iPad, but they don't have an iPad version.

414
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,860
And it doesn't seem like it would be all that hard for them to, well, maybe they've submitted, I don't have no idea.

415
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:13,860
But it's just unusable in, in the iPad, it's, you know, you can zoom it out to twice its size, so it kind of looks, you know, so it kind of fills up the screen.

416
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,860
It's still basically, let me just, chicks walking through the house.

417
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,860
It's still basically, you know, the old app and it gives you the old keyboard, so it doesn't take advantage of a lot of the new things.

418
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
I got to tell you about last night.

419
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:42,860
So, uh, Miss Mickey has a friend over and, uh, I'm 45, but for the first time my life, um, we all, uh, hopped into the hot tub.

420
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
That was cool.

421
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Don't want them hearing when they'm saying this, it was awesome.

422
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Hey, I don't have a jingle for one of our old friends on the Charlie, but he is back and is great to hear.

423
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,860
I'm the Jamaican in New York.

424
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Mr. Curry.

425
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Yes, ma'am.

426
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Jamaican in New York.

427
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Hello.

428
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
Welcome back to the DSC.

429
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Thank you.

430
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
For quite a while.

431
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,860
You know, since since you've been gone for so long, I decided, it'd be a good idea to do a refresher

432
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
and pet one.

433
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,860
So I'm going to teach you, and why it's your week.

434
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,860
I'm going to teach a few petal words that maybe you forgot, but you need to know.

435
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,860
You know, I really need to get my ass back to Jamaica.

436
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
That's for sure.

437
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
It's on the list.

438
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,860
You know, well, if you're going to Jamaica to smoke a slip, you need to know if you pack the

439
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
words.

440
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
I don't, I don't think I'll be doing that anymore.

441
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,860
I've, I've been away from it from a year, but I still need to know the words

442
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Jamaican New York.

443
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
So, let's talk.

444
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Of course.

445
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
Since you missed a curve.

446
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
Let's talk down through the curse works.

447
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Oh, okay.

448
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,860
Today I'm going to teach you one very valuable curse word.

449
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,860
I'm going to show you how to use it in a sentence.

450
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
A valuable information.

451
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Chuckle heads play along because it's always too good to know some petwak curse words.

452
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Today the word word of the day is bummer caught.

453
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
What?

454
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
No.

455
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Nobody really knows what this word is.

456
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
bummer caught.

457
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,860
But it's kind of like saying, oh shit.

458
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
Okay.

459
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
Slimbapult, bumble caught, bumble caught.

460
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
bumble caught.

461
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,360
bumble knows that you didn't get the right clarity HAATION ski.

462
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,860
All right.

463
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,860
bumble beneath thloud.

464
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
umbrella.

465
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
bumble Blind.

466
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
Grabble Punch.

467
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
One more time.

468
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Okayil bumble plot, bumble blocked.

469
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
I'm much better much better.

470
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
No.

471
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Thank you.

472
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Let me introduce it for sentence.

473
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Which has been a sentence for you guys.

474
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,140
And then we try a sentence.

475
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,980
Daniel the handyman's work is bumble plot

476
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,300
when it comes to timing.

477
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,620
Okay, here's a sentence.

478
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,380
bumble plot, bumble plot.

479
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,220
That's it.

480
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,660
See, this is one of those words that you don't need

481
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,780
other words around me to make a sentence.

482
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,940
It sounds alone, it's kinda like Madonna.

483
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,060
You know, bumble plot, bumble plot.

484
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,940
It's an expression you use when you're,

485
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,260
when you see something, you know, like a train crack.

486
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,940
bumble plot, bumble plot.

487
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,020
So, I don't know, this, this is your Jamaican

488
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,620
and the popular word of the big bumble plot.

489
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,820
Use it twice.

490
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,980
I shall use it wisely.

491
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,820
Do you make it in New York?

492
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,300
Thank you so much.

493
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I highly appreciate it.

494
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,780
Look forward to the next installment.

495
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,260
And we will be using the word all over Southern California.

496
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,140
Better Cooper for you.

497
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,980
Classic.

498
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,340
Wish I was born here and barely hills.

499
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,100
So sweet and sad, say.

500
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,100
From floating down, rode on drive.

501
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
She got a baddies back on me.

502
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,860
And a team's drove by her side.

503
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,900
And she walked her mother's lover.

504
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,940
To exercise her skill.

505
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,100
And as she comes going fast,

506
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,500
she moves it above the wheel.

507
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,780
Oh, I wish I were born and barely hills.

508
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,860
I swear I can train as much as she feels.

509
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
I want to lean up.

510
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,020
She might have said frail to me.

511
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,580
She got a little love.

512
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,980
Instead of the bills, yeah.

513
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,540
She says that she's an actress.

514
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,540
Just never got a part.

515
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,420
When she's a teenage man,

516
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,540
she'll have found out who she had.

517
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,300
She got a big heart to one day in the morning.

518
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
When things get too okay.

519
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,460
And what a drink is away.

520
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,940
And breath the oven stand.

521
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh, I wish I were born and barely hills.

522
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,220
I swear I can train as much as she feels.

523
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,180
I want to lean up.

524
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,900
She might cook sand for you.

525
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

526
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
She'd be like a doll.

527
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Yes, she's right in my head.

528
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,500
You ain't taking me to know better than hell.

529
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
You better take all your hands on my heart.

530
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
I'll stay.

531
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,500
I wish I were born and barely hills.

532
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I swear I can train as much as she feels.

533
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I want to lean up.

534
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
She might cook sand for you.

535
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

536
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

537
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

538
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

539
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

540
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

541
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

542
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

543
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

544
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

545
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

546
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

547
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

548
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

549
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

550
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,500
She'll hold off instead of the bills, yeah.

551
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Woo!

552
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Alice Cooper, classic Cooper on the Charley,

553
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
wish I were born and barely hills.

554
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,500
The most emailed YouTube video that I've received this week

555
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I think is actually appropriate and applicable for audio only.

556
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,000
We'll see how it works if you have not seen an old put a link to it in the show notes at dailysourceco.com

557
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,500
It's episode 11 of auto tune the news and these guys really really got a damn it's pure poppy cock

558
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:03,300
And this of course features high-coo harem on if I'm roboi the president of the United States of Europe

559
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
You have the charisma of the damn act

560
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500
You have the appearance of a bank club

561
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Who are you?

562
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
I don't believe you

563
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
If I prove that you would be in Europe and ever heard of you

564
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
I have no doubt that it's your attention

565
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,500
To be in the class as if you'd be in the office

566
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Back back because you come from Belgium

567
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Which of course is pretty much about nothing

568
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
We don't love you

569
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
We don't want you

570
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,500
I want to say that you're going to have to grasp the better

571
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
We don't like you

572
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
We don't want you

573
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
A lot of good reason

574
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
We love you

575
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Come back to the snag as I know it will be long

576
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Don't make me have to start over a thing

577
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Bring it on

578
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
This comes out of your empty

579
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
We don't love you

580
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
We don't want you

581
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
We don't like you

582
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
We don't like you

583
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Last month can you go cosby

584
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Was surprised to read the heat down like that

585
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
How can he read it these days

586
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Because his own robbers was the last to know he was on

587
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Maybe he should check his head

588
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
All of those stories of course up here

589
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Probably have that proliferated on

590
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
All right

591
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,500
We know the time making her shit is so sublime

592
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
But that of course is a little sour

593
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
It's a little sour

594
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
It's a little sour

595
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
It's something wants to serve the way

596
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
The fact that he moves on to fire

597
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
The type of flies

598
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
You can't protect the lift

599
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
And that's so striking

600
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Shorty

601
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
And the true desire for spaces

602
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
But please lies

603
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
And want to know

604
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
I can do a formation like Veronica

605
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
And a fool

606
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
You'll play me for a fool

607
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
You know it's by my side

608
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
We're broken

609
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
No, by the rip

610
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Rip, rip

611
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Tie a slice

612
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Hold on

613
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Rip, rip

614
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Tie a slice

615
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Take your puppy

616
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Hive your puppy

617
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Tie a slice

618
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Turn the turf

619
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
The way

620
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
I'm down, can you hold on your mire

621
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Rip, rip

622
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Tie a slice

623
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Lies, lies

624
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Lies, lies

625
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
You hit on a guy

626
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
A wedding

627
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
And so

628
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Explain that one for me

629
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Okay, so we're a wedding New Year's Eve

630
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Ever when I came to a much of dream

631
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Through 300 people there

632
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
I went on the bridesmaid dance with her

633
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
I grabbed and dodged her

634
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Now there's a guy

635
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
I go and come else

636
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Half her

637
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Yeah, I did

638
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Yeah, yeah

639
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah, yeah

640
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Just the back well

641
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
We all lived together

642
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
All the bachelor's in the evening

643
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,500
You can take anything out of time

644
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Tuck it

645
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
You can take anything out of time

646
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Tuck, scrub it

647
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
You can take anything out of time

648
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Tuck it

649
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,500
You can take anything out of time

650
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Tuck it

651
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
To the door, guys, jump on me

652
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
My ticket for a day

653
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Whether you're telling the truth or not

654
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
And now the lecture's coming your way

655
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
And now

656
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Oh, lunch

657
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500

663
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
You're a puppy cop

664
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Whether you're telling the truth or not

665
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
You're guaranteed a good car

666
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
And now

Yes

686
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
In the afternoon

687
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I'll be this

688
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Brown

689
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Yes

690
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Yes

691
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I don't know

692
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
It doesn't

693
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I don't know

694
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Yeah, right

695
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Iround

696
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
This is the first time

697
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
That's funny.

698
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Maybe it does need the actors to really punch at home.

699
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Whenever you hear the ball, swaggering down the hall.

700
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,500
You know, he's gonna drop a double cup on your tennis ball.

701
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Ain't nothin' wrong with a massive massage,

702
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
when you're in the product attack, when somethin' not.

703
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
You're too much breathing the bare hood that can't escape.

704
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Try to pretend they don't notice where he eject your head.

705
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Hey!

706
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Over the line.

707
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Auto tuned the news featuring Joel Madden from Good Charlotte,

708
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,500
which I'm not sure if he participated in this willingly.

709
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
If they just ripped him off and put him in there,

710
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
no matter what.

711
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I love those guys.

712
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
I have a link in the show notes at dailysourcecode.com.

713
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Of course, that was Nigel Farage at the very beginning.

714
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Minister of European Parliament for the UK independent party,

715
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
who is on the right track,

716
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,500
calling the president of the United States of Europe

717
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,500
a guy with a personality of a damp dish rag.

718
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Totally right.

719
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
High coup, Herman.

720
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
High coup, Herman.

721
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I'll be talkin' more about him on Noah Genda.

722
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Thursday.

723
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
In the morning, I am sure.

724
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Comics trip.

725
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Comics trip.

726
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Comics trip.

727
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Comics trip.

728
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Comics trip.

729
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Comics trip.

730
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Comics trip.

731
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Comics trip.

732
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Comics trip.

733
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
So, talking about the European Union here's our correspondent

734
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
The UK comic strip blogger.

735
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Hello, Adam.

736
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
I like Kerry.

737
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Here is CLB.

738
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Adam.

739
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,500
You remember, you go cast in USA?

740
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Ah, you go cast.

741
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Of course.

742
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
I've never owned one, never driven one, wouldn't go near one.

743
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
But yes, I recall.

744
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Yugoslavia is no more.

745
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,500
But imagine that Greece,

746
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
that if this could happen,

747
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
your currency is arrogant.

748
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
What?

749
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Hold on a second.

750
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Could you repeat that please?

751
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
That this could happen.

752
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Your currency is arrogant.

753
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
No.

754
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
There's no Greece.

755
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Okay, Gacha.

756
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
The country called Macedonia,

757
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
that previously was part of Yugoslavia.

758
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Right.

759
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
And this country, naturally,

760
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
wants to join European Union.

761
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,500
But Greece is blocking it.

762
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Because there's a region in Greece,

763
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
a province that is also called Macedonia.

764
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
And they say to you,

765
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
you can join, but you have to change your name.

766
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
You must change your name to not Macedonia.

767
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Otherwise, you will not allow you to join.

768
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Ew.

769
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
It's like a domain name dispute almost.

770
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
It's like you can have Macedonia.com.

771
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
That's ours.

772
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
You must change your name, slaves.

773
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
And speaking of screwed up,

774
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
you're okay in sin.

775
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
It is good for export,

776
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
based German,

777
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
that currency is weak,

778
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
and Germany can export more.

779
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
And you can see that even

780
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
the best situation has positive sides.

781
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Yo.

782
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Yo.

783
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I want a Sunday kind of love.

784
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,500
I love to last,

785
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
past,

786
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Saturday night.

787
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,500
And I'd like to know

788
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,500
it's more than love at first sight.

789
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:59,500
And I want a Sunday kind of love.

790
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Oh yeah.

791
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
I want a,

792
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,500
I love this on the square.

793
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Can't speak to my hands,

794
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
somebody,

795
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,500
someone to care.

796
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
And I,

797
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,500
I'm on the road,

798
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
the leaves,

799
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
to nowhere.

800
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I need a Sunday kind of love.

801
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I,

802
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
do my Sunday dreaming.

803
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Oh yeah.

804
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I want a Sunday,

805
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
every minute,

806
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
every hour,

807
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,500
every day.

808
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,500
I'm hoping to discover,

809
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,500
a certain kind of love.

810
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Who will tell me the way,

811
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,500
and my arms,

812
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
me,

813
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
someone,

814
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
someone to info.

815
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
They keep me warm,

816
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
when myness,

817
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
you do this,

818
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,500
broken.

819
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Love all my life,

820
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
to have,

821
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
and to,

822
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
oh,

823
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,500
I want a Sunday kind of love.

824
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Oh yeah.

825
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
I,

826
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I,

827
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
I,

828
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
I,

829
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
I,

830
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
I,

831
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I,

832
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
I,

833
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I,

834
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
I,

835
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
I,

836
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I,

837
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
I,

838
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I,

839
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
I,

840
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
I,

841
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
I know,

842
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
they don't understand.

843
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Oh yeah.

844
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I,

845
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
I,

846
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
I want a Sunday kind of love.

847
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
If I just,

848
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,500
made pieces of

849
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:29,500
three views to say,

850
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
fuck you American Idol.

851
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:39,620
So they kind of love on daily source code episode 826 that is a real talent my friends the stuff that dreams are made

852
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:13,380
Say hello to my little friend I love carry I'm a big source code

853
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Another promise, another scene, another, a package like to keep the jammed in grill

854
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:15,500
A green bell's wrapped around our minds and endless, a red tape to keep the truth confined

855
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:44,500
And we'll still be praying us and they will not control us

856
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:51,500
We will be very sorry

857
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,500
But in detention, our mind can't control, we can't have a revolution

858
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Take its toll if you could, I think the switch you don't bring it, but I'd say that

859
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
But we should never be afraid to die

860
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:21,500
We're right, so take our power back, it's time for the fact that you had a heart attack

861
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:29,500
And you know that the bad times coming to an end, we have to, but you'd find what you're flagging

862
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:36,500
And we'll still be praying

863
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:43,500
We will be very sorry

864
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,500
We will be very sorry

865
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:59,500
We will not control us

866
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:07,500
But we will be very sorry

867
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:28,500
We will be very sorry

868
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:38,500
We will be very sorry

869
00:42:38,500 --> 00:43:03,500
We will be very sorry

870
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:10,500
We will not control us

871
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:18,500
We will stop degrading us

872
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,500
We will not control us

873
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:35,500
We will be very sorry

874
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,500
I realize that made a card no mistake today, starting the Charlie Soleil

875
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,500
I'm competing with Cranky Geeks Dammit

876
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:49,500
It's just probably just about ended, so for those of you switching over, welcome, you're listening to the Daily Source Code live

877
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Episode 826 streaming at noagendastream.com

878
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,500
And as you know, this program is made possible by donations

879
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,500
To the noagendastream, check it out, I've got a whole sustaining producers page at noagendastream.com

880
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,500
And oh look, here's another old friend of the Charlie

881
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Hello Adam, it's the candyman here

882
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,500
He's still the only contributor to the Daily Source Code, who has a jingle made by Christina Aguilera

883
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I forgot to line that up, how stupid am I, oh well

884
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Just chiming into tell you that I'm very happy to see that the DSC is back in action

885
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:36,500
And I'm really looking forward to see how it develops and how you are evolving it into its new format

886
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,500
And about that, you know, I think I'm going to go a lot more music heavy, which is what it seems to be

887
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Because the message that I have to project or force upon you is obviously mainly in the music, which is I think the best way to propagate any type of message

888
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Being used by dictators for many, many years, so I think it works

889
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,500
We've had more pod safe stuff that was worth playing though, please always continue to send me stuff adamantcurry.com

890
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:19,500
Just wanted to give some feedback on people who are commenting that you are talking about donations quite a lot on both noagenda and the Daily Source Code

891
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Yeah, you know, that's kind of interesting because I have seen this being this threads in the forum and noagendaforms.com

892
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,500
And there's always discussion about this, but it doesn't matter what you do, there's always a discussion about it

893
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Whether you have advertising, underwriting, sponsorship, whatever you want to call it, or if you're just asking for donations

894
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:45,500
There's always going to be someone bitching and moaning about it or complaining about it or, but you know what?

895
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Well, I'll let you finish your comment first

896
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:55,500
From my own experience, I can just tell them that really if you appreciate what you're hearing on the Daily Source Code

897
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,500
Noagenda then it's just better to donate you feel much better

898
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Yeah, it's exactly, it's like taking a magical pill, you feel much better

899
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Afterwards, I mean, after making a small donation, even you can really have a piece of mind when you're listening to both noagenda and the Daily Source Code

900
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,500
And you don't have to be bothered with the, you talking about donations all the time

901
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,500
First of all, we're not talking about it all the time

902
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,500
And even if I did, you know, we've discovered a new model for podcasting

903
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,500
And it's working okay for us, we see enough potential

904
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:40,500
And I think that maybe, you know, certainly with maybe not Daily Source Code depends on how you feel about it

905
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:46,500
But with noagenda, we're clearly providing some value that people value incredibly highly

906
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,500
And I think that's a perfect way to do it

907
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm giving you a great product and if you like it, then you give me something in return

908
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
A couple of digits through the computer

909
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
No, that's all I have to say for now

910
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
So I'll be back some other time and I'll back to the show

911
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Bye-bye

912
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
Yeah, thank you

913
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:08,500
And I will remind everybody that of course there's a couple hundred people who are listening to the stream as we do the show live

914
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
But you know, it's basically a podcast

915
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
There's this thing that, gee, I don't know if Apple patented it

916
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
But it's called the Fast Forward button

917
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,500
I mean, you know, it's a concept

918
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,500
You don't want to listen to anything including a song

919
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
And give it

920
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,500
It's a simple simple system

921
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
Talking about Rudy Sars are earlier

922
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,500
And I'll be played on this track for this is D.O. Rainbow in the dark on 826

923
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I'm crying for Rudy

924
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
I feel it dancing in the light

925
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:05,500
It was cold, lost my whole to the shadows of the night

926
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,500
No sign of the moon is coming

927
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,500
You've been left home, you're alone

928
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,500
It's like a rainbow in the dark

929
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,500
A rainbow in the dark

930
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Do your demons

931
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Do they ever let you go

932
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,500
When you're trying to behind the inside

933
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,500
You just saw one that you know

934
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,500
You're just like a picture

935
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,500
You're in your face caught in time

936
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,500
We were late, you were late

937
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,500
We were lost without a rise

938
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,500
There's no sign of the moon is coming

939
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
You've been left home, you're alone

940
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,500
It's like a rainbow in the dark

941
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Just a rainbow in the dark

942
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
Yeah

943
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:55,500
You're just like a rainbow in the dark

944
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,500
We were lost without a rise

945
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,500
We were lost without a rise

946
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,500
You know it all was pretty dark

947
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,500
I've caught it free in the city next to me

948
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Put it up from the floor

949
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Feel the magic

950
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,500
I feel it frown to me

951
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
But it's here

952
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
And you're here

953
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Calling you everywhere

954
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Look out

955
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,500
This little sign to the moon

956
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Call me

957
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,500
There's no sign of the pain

958
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,500
You've been left home, you're alone

959
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Not a rainbow

960
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Not a rainbow in the dark

961
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,500
Yeah

962
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,500
You're a rainbow in the dark

963
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Yeah, that takes me back

964
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Do you know rainbow in the dark

965
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
Come the Charlie

966
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,500
We've got to mention that if you do find value in this program

967
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Precent support this and other

968
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Show is running on the knowledge and the stream

969
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,500
The knowledge and the stream.com

970
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,500
You can donate by going to knowledge and the internet

971
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Yeah, I think there's a link at knowledge and the stream.com

972
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
But it's a devorek.org slash n-a-s

973
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
November alpha c-era

974
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
And your support is highly appreciated

975
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
If you'd like any of the songs that are played on the show

976
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Then you can just head over to the show

977
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Notes of daily source code.com

978
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
And I'm basically ever resorted now to

979
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Putting links to the artist's home pages

980
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Because I guess they know best

981
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Where they want you to go by their music

982
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,500
And please, I certainly encourage you

983
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Behind their songs

984
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Let me see

985
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Oh yes, I mentioned on the previous show about the

986
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Sis opportunity for Sis admins and network administrators

987
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,500
I've received a lot more email

988
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,500
And people requesting more information than I expected

989
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
Email will go out at the end of this week

990
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Explaining exactly what the opportunity is

991
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,500
Putting together a little army of people

992
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Who I hope to help make some money

993
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Because they do such brilliant work

994
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,500
So

995
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
And please, no more submissions

996
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Because I've just got too many already

997
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
And we're going to have to phase it in

998
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,500
But it is kind of nice that I now have this nice list of people

999
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
That when the shit really hits the fan

1000
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,500
I can reach out to him

1001
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Looks like we got guys all around the world

1002
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,500
Who are more than willing to help

1003
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,500
And totally, totally kicks ass

1004
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Then one more thing

1005
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,500
I want to talk about, well you know what?

1006
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
I'll talk about my iPhone app next

1007
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Then we'll wrap up the show

1008
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,500
So let me just play a couple more songs

1009
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Yeah, turn on the foam

1010
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,500
You want to dance through this one

1011
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
None of those mashups

1012
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Thanks from

1013
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
To Digi Geek

1014
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Who dropped him in a drop.io site

1015
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
Please do the same

1016
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
There's anything you want me to

1017
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,500
Consider for playing

1018
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Go to drop.io

1019
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Free

1020
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
You can upload 100 megs

1021
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Send me the link and I'll check it out

1022
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Maybe we'll play it on the next

1023
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
Stabby source code

1024
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
What's in the morning feeling like pizza

1025
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Little girl

1026
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Glasses on the door

1027
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
I'm kind of hit this city

1028
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Before I leave

1029
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Fresh my teeth with a bottle

1030
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Check cause then I leave

1031
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
More than that I ain't coming

1032
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
That I'm talking

1033
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Get your hot hot toast

1034
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
Try not all our clothes

1035
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
What's going on

1036
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
My phone spawns

1037
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Drops up in plain

1038
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
I think we're see

1039
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
These are an episode

1040
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,500
The party is trying to get a little bit tips

1041

Don't say

You can't be too close

Do you know

1061
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Do you know

1062
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Why do we see

1063
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500

1091
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,580
Be shit as down, down, ho-ho-to, as down

1092
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,500
Don't shut me, your body's jammed off

1093
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:56,100
Who's up tonight, I'm a fight, so we see the sun lights

1094
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,700
It's like I'm a clock, the party's on stop

1095
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,140
Last night, last night, last night

1096
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,620
You'll be right, you'll be mine

1097
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,340
You're great, you'll fall

1098
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,500
My heart is down, that you've got me

1099
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,780
With my hands up, you've got me now

1100
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,900
You've got that some, yeah, you've got me

1101
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,780
I totally must, I'll walk you, my mer!

1102
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,500
Down, down

1103
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:45,500
I must be the son of California Sunshine doing it to me.

1104
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,500
That actually keeps the versus queen radio TikTok.

1105
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:54,500
There's a DJs from Mars bootleg and I'll put a link to some page where you can find that.

1106
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,500
I'm the show notes of DaddySourceCode.com.

1107
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:12,500
I think Mickey went over in Cabocht, handyman Daniel's work.

1108
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,500
He's been awfully quiet.

1109
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,500
So a couple things going on here at the Hilltop Watch Tower,

1110
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
setting up the studio.

1111
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,500
I'm pretty much now becoming the Southern California Outpost from EVO,

1112
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,500
which is great.

1113
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
By the way, your donations are helping me sustain this project.

1114
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
And it's highly appreciated.

1115
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
So I'm actually able to do more.

1116
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,500
There he is.

1117
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
You know, do stuff like the Daily Source Code.

1118
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Hopefully on a two-day a week mission.

1119
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,500
So it's going to be pretty awesome setting up a little video studio with green screen in the garage here.

1120
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,500
And a couple other projects that I'm working on.

1121
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,500
I've been working on my iPhone app.

1122
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,500
And it is specifically at this point in iPhone app.

1123
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,500
I'm about ready to submit it to the Apple Store.

1124
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,500
And I've been holding back a little bit of course because of the iPad noise.

1125
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,500
And although, of course, we'll run and have actually seen it run on the iPad.

1126
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,500
It is not intended for the iPad.

1127
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,500
In fact, I'm going to have to do a whole separate version just for it.

1128
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,500
But I need to understand the device more before I can get to it.

1129
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
So let me just, I'm not going to tell you again.

1130
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,500
I'm not going to exactly what this iPhone app does because it kind of blows the whole experience.

1131
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
But there's two parts to it.

1132
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
One is the actual iPhone app itself.

1133
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,500
And then there's a continuous updates which come in the form of video.

1134
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,500
And that's really the part that is specific for the iPhone and the iPad.

1135
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,500
So I'm actually happy that Apple is going to get the iPhone back in the news again.

1136
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,500
And I guess tomorrow morning in the morning,

1137
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:56,500
they're going to be talking about the release of the operating system for.

1138
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,500
I wish I could talk to you in a little quiet environment.

1139
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
I could get my thoughts together a little better.

1140
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,500
But anyway, I've been working with some old friends and new friends on this thing.

1141
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:11,500
I think I've told you that, you know, I got the iPhone application development for

1142
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
this book and I got it.

1143
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:20,500
I went to basically do the bookstore and rated everything on the shelf that talks about iPhone app development.

1144
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
And it's a lot simpler than I thought it would be.

1145
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,500
You know, you fire up X code, which is Apple's development environment.

1146
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,500
They're tool.

1147
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,500
And you kind of like, oh, what's all this stuff?

1148
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,500
And what are all these little windows and pains and all this things going on?

1149
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:40,500
But when you really start to focus on it and I do highly recommend the iPhone application development for dummies.

1150
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,500
Because, you know, you basically can build an iPhone app within a minute.

1151
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,500
You know, it's just, you can even if it just says hello world on the home screen.

1152
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,500
And you can put it on your iPhone, you're like, okay, I did something here.

1153
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
It was just pretty cool.

1154
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,500
And you can design your interface and it's got all kinds of drag and drop capabilities.

1155
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,500
And what's really nice, of course, with anyone learning a new coding language and the,

1156
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,500
then Apple uses something called Objective C.

1157
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,500
Is there so much sample code around that you can copy and paste.

1158
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
You can kind of get something working pretty quickly.

1159
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
So I had this idea.

1160
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,500
And I think something that is absolutely necessary.

1161
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,500
If you see the sheer amount of apps that are available for the iPhone,

1162
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
like something like the numbers vary.

1163
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,500
They say 140 to 170,000 applications.

1164
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,500
So how do you find your way through all of these?

1165
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Well, that's hopefully what my iPhone app will solve.

1166
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
It's going to help you with that.

1167
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
If that gives you a clue.

1168
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,500
And I've been working with the Brent Simmons over at newsgator.

1169
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Who I've known since, wow, since the radio user land days.

1170
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,500
And he's been instrumental in helping me on some of the coding.

1171
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,500
And I'll be talking about his new endeavor in the next coming weeks.

1172
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
A lot of it on the daily source code.

1173
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,500
And also some new guys from rogue sheep who,

1174
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
help me with the design.

1175
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,500
Because if there's anything that I'm not, it's a graphic designer.

1176
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,500
And I really wanted to, you know, put some,

1177
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,500
put some real effort into the way the, the application looks and functions.

1178
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,500
And these guys, they design the award-winning app called poster,

1179
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
which you might want to take a look at.

1180
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,500
It's, well, you'll have, I'm not post or postage.

1181
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
I'm sorry.

1182
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
It's a beautiful app.

1183
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,500
And we just see the interface.

1184
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,500
It does things that I didn't even know you could do in an iPhone app.

1185
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,500
And again, your donations, this will be a free app,

1186
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,500
by the way, your donations are helping compensate those guys for,

1187
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
for helping out because they can't work for free.

1188
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
So it's really, it's going a long way.

1189
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,500
And I hope you all enjoy it.

1190
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,500
I think I will be submitting it sometime near the end of this week.

1191
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,500
And then I'll be moving over to, to the iPad version,

1192
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,500
which again, we'll take extra production on the video side.

1193
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,500
And I'm wondering if I wanted to say anything about the iPad,

1194
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,500
because, you know, I'm reading all these blog posts and, you know,

1195
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,500
pros and cons and everything from, oh, it's a magical device.

1196
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,500
It's the Jesus tablet to, this is horrible, new world order,

1197
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Apple won't let me do anything.

1198
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,500
And, you know, I've had a very different experience developing

1199
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,500
with Apple's tools along with their, you know,

1200
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,500
with the basic of their developer support system.

1201
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
And I got to tell you, it's outstanding.

1202
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,500
And particularly, maybe because I'm new to it.

1203
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,500
And I have some, I have my own take as a new developer on,

1204
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,500
on how they handle things and all the pros and cons.

1205
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
And we'll save that for another day. Why don't we do that?

1206
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:53,500
In the meantime, let's rock it out with one last track.

1207
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I'm the Charlie. I think Xeroza's future is going on the background on this one.

1208
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:03,500
Mary Magdalene, all the trigger slow, part two.

1209
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,500
All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1210
01:03:33,500 --> 01:04:03,500
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey I really kinda put in the glass, I sorta put in the glass, I kinda put in the Gotta ll do nice and we

1211
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,500
And the punch to keep that be better off dead or maybe raped.

1212
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
I probably heard of it in any way.

1213
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
I put on the walls in the street of the bed.

1214
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
I don't want an ambulance, man.

1215
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
But to the asylum, I'm sick of my silence.

1216
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,500
What are you doing, man?

1217
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
I'm losing the baby.

1218
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
You'll be woken to give me that shit that love.

1219
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,500
My soul can give me that shit.

1220
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Maybe I'm just gonna show up to my feelings for it.

1221
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,500
So all the pain is a pleasure in M.B. and D.E.D.

1222
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,500
OCD makes it up with B.C.B.

1223
