I love to be strong, I'd let it clear.

678
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:21,820
I think a lot of people are disappointed that you gave up like that.

679
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,820
Hello?

680
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Are we good now? Are we square?

681
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,820
We're good.

682
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,820
Should I tell you this week what happened in you, maybe?

683
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
Sure, go ahead, why don't you?

684
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
We've never done this live before.

685
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,820
There's this kougar, or is it poma?

686
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,820
What does she do?

687
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,820
You mean Lady Ashton?

688
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:59,820
She's not a kougar, she's an ugly peto bear.

689
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:06,820
So she was disappointed because she couldn't speak on the United Nations session.

690
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:14,820
Actually, it is coming into the first in September that European Union will be represented in the United Nations.

691
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,820
So they will be able to speak.

692
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,820
There's no voting power because UK is vetoing it.

693
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,820
But it is coming soon and she was trying to speak.

694
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,820
They said, no, you have no speaking rights yet and they're voting on this.

695
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,820
So you know, you are very close union.

696
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,820
It's not like NAFTA or like ASA, I know like African union.

697
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,820
It's very close union.

698
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
It's a scam.

699
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,820
It's a scam is what it is, comic strip blogger.

700
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,820
And I told I was talking about this before the whole Lisbon Treaty vote.

701
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,820
And I think people should have stood up and should have rioted against it.

702
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,820
And I haven't heard you being happy about the EU for the past year.

703
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,820
I think it is partially a scam, but I think it is.

704
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,820
What is the alternative for the European Union?

705
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Just go back to being your own states.

706
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,820
It was fine that way.

707
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,820
There was nothing wrong with it.

708
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,820
You know, the idea of having one single monetary unit was interesting.

709
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,820
It made sense for people not to have to change their money at the border.

710
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Now you've got one big central bank and they're screwing you.

711
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,820
And you escape to USA.

712
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,820
You are even American.

713
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
Why do you care?

714
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,820
I care because I care about my friends in Europe.

715
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,820
And I care about you comics for blogger.

716
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
All right, my friend.

717
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,820
I'm going to keep it moving with some music.

718
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,820
So from now on, you will continue to send in EU reports because I do appreciate them.

719
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,820
I really continue.

720
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,820
You know, the kicking stuff we are called.

721
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
I understand you didn't bend me.

722
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Just keep me because you like to kick people.

723
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Yeah.

724
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
It's fun.

725
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
It's like hitting people in the mouth.

726
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
No, it's don't take it personally.

727
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Yeah, it's little punch in the mouth.

728
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
It's kind of different.

729
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,820
CSB hop in the chat room we miss you.

730
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Okay, I'm coming.

731
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
All right.

732
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
Take care now.

733
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820

Comics strip.

737
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,820
Comics strip.

738
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Comics strip.

739
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
Comics strip.

740
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
Comics strip.

741
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
Comics strip.

742
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Comics strip.

743
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,820
And I queued up a song just for you CSB.

744
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,820
This is my love song to you.

745
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Look inside.

746
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,820
Look inside your tiny mind.

747
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,820
Then look a bit harder.

748
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,820
Cause we're so uninspired.

749
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
So sick and tired.

750
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,820
Of all the hatred you hold on.

751
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,820
So you say it's not okay to be gay.

752
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,820
You're a thick, you're just evil.

753
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,820
You're just some racist, you come a time on a racist.

754
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,820
Your point of view is my view.

755
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Oh, oh, oh.

756
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Oh, Oh, oh, oh.

757
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Cause we hate it like it did.

758
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,820
Only hate your own grus.

759
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
Please, I'll say it's all

760
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Fuck you, I'll keep on giving very very hard

761
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,820

Like so, please, I'll say it's all

763
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,820
Who you can, do you get a little kick out of being small minded?

764
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,820
You want to be like a father, it's approval you're after

765
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,820
But it's not how you find it

766
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,820
Do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?

767
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,820
Cause if a hole in your soul should be using control of it

768
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,820
And it's really this taste come on

769

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,820
Cause you lost, don't translate it, it's getting hard

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,820
Like so, please, I'll say it's all

774
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:50,820
You say, you think we need to go to war, you're already in one

775
00:33:50,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Cause this people like you, the need to guess you, no one wants your opinion

776
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,820
Oh, kids, oh, keep up, you're very, very hard

777
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:15,820
Cause they hate waiting, when they hate you, I'll close up, please, I'll stay in time

778
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,820
Oh, you, oh, keep up, you're very, very hard

00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,820
So please, I'll stay in time

781
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,820
The father of the airways has landed and he's sounding good to me

782
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,820
This is the daily source code with Adam Curry

783
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,820
Oh, oh, it's magic, you know

784
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:29,820
We're living outside, it's magic, you know

785
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,820
We're living outside

786
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,820
Nothing to worry, nothing to make it

787
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,820
But you know, I feel it all with the morning

788
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Lazy day in bed, music in my head

789
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Crazy music playing in the morning

790
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,820
Oh, oh, it's magic, you know

We're living outside

793
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,820
A love beside me day, dream about the way

794
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,820
Dreaming on my pillow with the morning

795
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Never been away, hey, never seen the day

796
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,820
Dreaming on my pillow with the morning

797
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Oh, oh, it's magic, you know

798
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:58,820

799
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,820

We're living outside, it's magic, you know

803
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:49,820
We're living outside

804
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,820
I let it down the Charlie

805
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, by request

806
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,820
I gotta tell you, I'm loving the songs you guys put together

807
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,820
For this daily source code, this NaFu Saturday edition

808
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,820
And hugs a lot is in the chat room

809
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,820
And as she tweeted this and I was like, oh my goodness

810
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,820
She wants me to roll out the God card

811
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,820
I must comply, in other words, I will obey

812
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Here is David Hasselah

813
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,820
Watch the way like the snow on the rain

814
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,820
There's been a lot of compromising

815
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,820
On the road to my horizon

816
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,820
But I wanna be where the lights are shining on me

817
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Lack of rants down the ground

818
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:12,820
Riding out on a horse in a star's bank of value

819
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Lack of rants down cowboys

820
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Getting caught to let us from people I don't even know

821
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,820
The first coming over the phone

822
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,820
Where we don't mind the rain

823
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,820
And the smile can hide all the pain

824
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,820
But you're down when you're riding the train

825
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Let's take them along

826
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,820
And that dream of the things I'll do

827
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,820
There's a way to get in a dollar to dance at my shoe

828
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:08,820
There'll be a look on the horizon

829
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,820
On the road to my horizon

830
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:19,820
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me

1810
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:26,820
With the time to get in touch with your feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get only touch with my feelings, baby says I should do my time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings, baby says I should use the time to get in touch with my feelings,

1811
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:32,920
peaking at number seven, although my friend's story was really nice to hear, I think our

1812
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:39,820
chuckle king could tell a lot more about that. So I first got to take you all back to 1986.

1813
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,820
Are you ready?

1814
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,820
No.

1815
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,820
Skybird, listen drum kick with a red dash, alpha message in two parts, break, break.

1816
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,820
A copy hour, I'm going to go home.

1817
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,820
And a curry.

1818
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,820
So Adam, you are 22 years old?

1819
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:02,820
Probably a little shy, but with a great victory in your eyes standing next to the other

1820
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,820
guy of Sly Fox. Let's go all the way.

1821
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,820
You're crazy.

1822
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,820
I wish you all a very nice weekend.

1823
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,820
Let's not buy now.

1824
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,820
Let's go all the way.

1825
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:31,820
Make sure you want to scream your shot.

1826
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,820
There's a picture for you.

1827
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:40,820
No one wants to dance.

1828
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,820
You're the boy in the sky.

1829
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:50,820
To clean your chairs.

1830
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:55,820
Let's go all the way.

1831
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,820
Let's go all the way.

1832
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1833
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:05,820
Let's go all the way.

1834
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,820
Walking in the back trees.

1835
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:15,820
Eight days a week.

1836
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,820
Try to make the love.

1837
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:25,820
Down one of these.

1838
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,820
Parts will be the best.

1839
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:35,820
Having a reality.

1840
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:38,820
There's none more men.

1841
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:44,820
We're living in fantasy.

1842
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:49,820
Let's go all the way.

1843
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:54,820
Let's go all the way.

1844
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,820
Let's go all the way.

1845
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1846
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:13,820
Let's go all the way.

1847
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,820
Just like a new chord

1848
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,820
A new chord

1849
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,820
As a whole channel

1850
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,820
As a beer man of war

1851
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,820
You have a bunch in this

1852
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,820
Sitting in the sand

1853
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,820
The sun

1854
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:36,820
The sun

1855
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:37,820
The sun

1856
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,820
The heart is wet

1857
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,820
There's no hope

1858
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,820
Just like a new chord

1859
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,820
It's made me play

1860
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,820
The whole right

1861
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,820
Yes you have done yourself once again

1862
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,820
Slide Fox

1863
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,820
Let's go all the way

1864
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,820
With the ring on the Charlie

1865
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,820
and let's go all the ring

1866
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:16,380
all the way. There you go. Great. Great fine. I get ready for the La La La

1867
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,780
Park. Come on, Chapman. You can do this part.

1868
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,500
La La La La La La La La La La La La

1869
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:29,980
So here is the backstory to that. I was presenting the music program Countdown

1870
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:37,180
indeed I was 22 I guess. And Sly Fox actually was a number one song and it was two

1871
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:43,500
guys and essentially a drum machine and they got into some kind of fight or something and

1872
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:49,740
50% of Sly Fox decided not to show up in the studio in the Netherlands and was kind of weird.

1873
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:55,500
Of course the whole thing is a track anyway and it would just be one guy on stage and that

1874
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,900
would look stupid. It just wouldn't look right. It would feel wrong especially the video

1875
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:07,580
because it had the two guys featured in it and the director I think at the time that was

1876
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:13,100
you didn't compel who unfortunately passed away earlier this year. He said well why not

1877
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:18,940
you do it? Like what? Yeah you can do this. Just get the crowd all crazy so I had to learn lyrics

1878
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:23,420
and I was singing along you know when you learn lyrics like that you some for some reason you

1879
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:28,380
just don't you don't forget him. It just stays with you and I believe there is still a video of

1880
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,220
that available somewhere on YouTube if you can find it posted into the chat at knowledge

1881
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:38,860
in the chat.net please. How about a little bit of 10cc for y'all on this snafu Saturday? Here's one of my favorites.

1882
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:13,100
No no waitin' by the telephone. No no waitin' for the phone to me.

1883
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:30,140
Oh Donna, you made me break up. You made me break down Donna, break down Donna, break down.

1884
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,980
You made me break up. You made me break up. You made me break up. You made me break up.

1885
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:47,180
Me in one waiting by the telephone. No no no no, Donna, this waiting for the phone to me.

1886
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:59,740
Hello hello darling. Yes I love you darling. Yes I love you darling. Yes I love you.

1887
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:07,140
You made me stand up

1888
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:11,140
You made me stand up

1889
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,140
You made me stand up

1890
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:20,140
You made me stand up

1891
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:25,140
You made me stand up

1892
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:32,140
You made me stand up

1893
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:38,140
You made me stand up

1894
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:49,140
You made me stand up

1895
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:55,140
You made me stand up

1896
01:10:55,140 --> 01:11:01,140
You made me stand up

1897
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:04,500
Oh

1898
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,180
Kevin Gaudly little cream and 10 C C.

1899
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:20,460
I think I was God this must have been 1970

1900
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,300
For something like that.

1901
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,900
I love this song because not and I was just we taught about the time

1902
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,780
I was like 10 years old, when this was a huge hit

1903
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,780
And I remember thinking a lot of Donna man, she must be freaking hot.

1904
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,780
I was probably when my first sexual fantasy started appearing, like Donna.

1905
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,780
Oh man, these guys are singing about her, she must be so incredibly awesome.

1906
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:46,780
Around that same time, I had other sexual fantasies, my friends.

1907
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:52,780
Chuckle heads around the world, and I know that some of you have had exactly the same sexual fantasy.

1908
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,780
And I want to share it with you right now.

1909
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,780
Do you remember Julie?

1910
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,780
Oh yeah.

1911
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:03,780
I remember looking at Julie in a beautiful white outfit and thinking, oh my god.

1912
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,780
She would look so awesome naked.

1913
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,780
Exciting and new.

1914
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,780
Come aboard.

1915
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:24,780
We're expecting you when love.

1916
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,780
Life's sweet as we were.

1917
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,780
Let it flow.

1918
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:38,780
It floats back to you.

1919
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:46,780
The love won't soon be making another run.

1920
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:50,780
The love won't run.

1921
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:55,780
From this is something for everyone.

1922
01:12:55,780 --> 01:13:02,780
Set a course for adventure, your mind on a new romance.

1923
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:09,780
And love won't hurt anymore.

1924
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:19,780
It's an open smile on a friendly show.

1925
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:23,780
The love won't get lost.

1926
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,780
We'll come along with love.

1927
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,780
That's right, Julie.

1928
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,780
You're a cruise director.

1929
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,780
Oh, I loved her so much.

1930
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,780
And just when you thought the Charlie couldn't get any gayer,

1931
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,780
well, hopefully he's my friends.

1932
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:53,780
All night I work all day to pay the bills I had to pay.

1933
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,780
Hey, need said.

1934
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:01,780
And still, the never seems to be a single penny left for me.

1935
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,780
That's too bad.

1936
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:08,780
In my dreams, I have a plan.

1937
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:12,780
If I could be a wealthy man,

1938
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,780
I wouldn't have to work at all.

1939
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:18,780
I could run the never born.

1940
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,780
Money, money, money, money.

1941
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,780
Must be funny.

1942
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,780
In the rich man's world.

1943
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,780
Money, money, money.

1944
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,780
Always funny.

1945
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,780
In the rich man's world.

1946
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:45,780
All the things I could do.

1947
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:49,780
In my head a little money.

1948
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,780
It's the rich man's world.

1949
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,780
It's the rich man's world.

1950
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,780
A man like that is hard to find,

1951
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,780
But I can get enough of my mind.

1952
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,780
Any sad.

1953
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:13,780
And if he happens to be free, I bet he won't fancy me.

1954
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,780
That's too bad.

1955
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,780
So I must dream.

1956
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,780
I'll have to go.

1957
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:24,780
To Las Vegas or Monaco.

1958
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,780
And win a fortune in a game.

1959
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,780
My life will never be the same.

1960
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,780
My life will never be the same.

1961
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,780
My life will never be the same.

1962
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,780
My life will never be the same.

1963
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,780
My life will never be the same.

1964
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,780
My life will never be the same.

1965
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,780
My life will never be the same.

1966
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,780
My life will never be the same.

1967
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,780
My life will never be the same.

1968
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,780
My life will never be the same.

1969
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,780
My life will never be the same.

1970
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,780
My life will never be the same.

1971
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,780
My life will never be the same.

1989
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:42,460
I got admit that I was absolutely part of the anti-abacru, and my sister Tiffany, she was

1990
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:49,500
just totally obsessed with them, she had all the albums, all the albums, and I was like,

1991
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,820
that's so wrong, because of course I was into scarring, you know, stuff bands like

1992
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:59,900
selector and madness, and I had the skinny tie on, I had the pointy black shoes, and I had

1993
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:05,260
the really thin pants on, or mine maybe should play some of that in a little bit. I did some

1994
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:11,580
requests, so get into the chat room if you can, no agenda chat.net, or Twitter to me if you will,

1996
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:38,380
True love takes a lot of trial, oh I'm crying.

1997
01:17:53,820 --> 01:18:00,940
True love takes a lot of pain, oh, hang on, hang on, hang on, do what we got.

I've been turning it all down

2001
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,820
Cool up while I'm burning

2002
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,820
If I'm quiet dying and I feel like

2003
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:37,820
Shots me out and I'm the eyes for holding us

2004

Play, play, play, play

2007
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,820
You know what I'm saying

2008
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,820
But I'm longer

Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:04,820
Between us, hang on, hang on

2013
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,820
Hang on, hang on

What we got is good

2015
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,580
I come am I from

2016
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,820
I'd be caught around me

2017
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:30,820
I'd be caught around me

2018
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:34,820
playing a source cold

2019
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:37,820
I'd be caught around me

2020
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:42,820
I'm getting caught inside the source

2021
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,820
I'd be caught around me

2022
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:48,820
A remote time

2023
01:20:48,820 --> 01:21:11,520
sav

2024
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,040
Lucassus

2025
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,520
begin

2026
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:24,520
Break those eyes up, but you terrorize you, realize your dream and scream.

2027
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:56,520
Wasting time and consequential needs to be watching someone else's straight.

2028
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:04,520
You hold me in the tent to reach you gotta get out of your city.

2029
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,520
No, you've got the gift, because you've seen it since you've lived.

2030
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:17,520
The surprise it is that they're for rounds I've seen you as per a selection.

2031
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,520
All you play is darkness, man, we're losing it.

2032
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:44,520
We are here, I've got some old rose that for me, a selection meal and all of them.

2033
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:52,520
And now I'll kick you in for real, because you're not feeling it.

2034
01:22:52,520 --> 01:23:02,520
The surprise it is that they're for rounds I've seen you as per a selection meal and all of them.

2035
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:08,520
And now I'll kick you in for real, because you've seen it since you've lived.

2036
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:17,520
The surprise it is that they're for rounds I've seen you as per a selection meal and all of them.

2037
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:34,520
The only endless people, all of them, and why they see us, all of us.

2038
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:46,520
The surprise it is that they're for rounds I've seen you as per a selection meal and all of them.

2039
01:23:47,520 --> 01:24:13,520
The surprise it is that they're for rounds I've seen you as per a selection meal and all of them.

2040
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:19,520
Yeah, I missed an excellent hot box moment there. Kind of like it when the stream just fell dead.

2041
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,520
You're in the machine, scream your recap on the Charlie episode 843.

2042
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:30,520
The snafu Saturday edition coming to you from the Hilltop Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center.

2043
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,520
And please welcome Sir Jeff Smith.

2044
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:52,520
I don't really want to talk tonight. I don't really want to make you cry.

2045
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,520
I just want to see a rocking roll tonight.

2046
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,520
It's not the right time to think about it.

2047
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:08,520
Let's close your lips, come on a twist and shout.

2048
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:14,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2049
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:26,520
When you get it, it can move yourself. Come on.

2050
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:33,520
All the songs on the radio, a deep and brood and a little now low.

2051
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:39,520
That's okay sometimes, but not tonight.

2052
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:46,520
Let's clap your hands and sweep your hips. All we need is a little sound like this.

2053
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:53,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2054
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:59,520
When you get it, it can move yourself.

2055
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:07,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2056
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:14,520
When you get it, it can move yourself.

2057
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2058
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,520
When you get it, it can move yourself.

2059
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2060
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,520
When you get it, it can move yourself.

2061
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:37,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2062
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:43,520
When you get it, it can move yourself.

2063
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,520
What's wrong with the little rocking roll?

2064
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:52,520
When you get it, it can move yourself.

2065
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:57,520
Listen, those people they get out of bed and they put their pants on one leg at a time.

2066
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,200
But he made 10 records, that's what I'm telling you.

2067
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,800
Black with more cowbells.

2068
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,640
Black and girl.

2069
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,640
A little bit of rock and roll.

Getting some suggestions for the snafu.

Sub-sacchar.

2077
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,840
It's almost like a Saturday dance party.

2078
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,480
Salt and pepper.

2079
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,480
Push it good.

I'm sure there's a lot of shame.

2283

I'm sure there's a lot of shame.

2284
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,600
Cause I'm a better.

2285
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,600
And I'm not sure.

2286
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,600

I'm like crazy.

2288
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,600

2389
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,060
compilations on it they don't include the artist you get to watch out when you buy

2390
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:02,020
a night tunes and it's because the music industry can't figure their shit out

2391
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:06,880
if there's so much stuff you actually can't get on iTunes that's just not

2392
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,540
available but when they put stuff on they're like freaking ruin it by putting

2393

the wrong versions up totally pisses me off
