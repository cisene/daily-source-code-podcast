00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 834, Food Bar Friday.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We're 16 months and seven.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We've been showing five lines of time.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Turn.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The 21st century of radio stars here.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We don't need us.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We can't see any of us.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
On the knowledge and the strength of our podcasting.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's the bedroom curry.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All the babies who are Friday.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Everything's fucked up.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You don't repair.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's get the chance of it.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Not in the way that we hold in it.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's not in the way you say you can.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not in the way you've been treating the friends.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's not in the way that you stand here.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's not in the way you look all the things that you said it through.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All the life.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Love is that always on time.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All the life.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Love is that always on time.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not in the way that you're told that it's weird.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's not in the way you say you're my blue.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not in the way that you came back to me.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's not in the way that your life's set free.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's not in the way you look all the things that you said it through.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All the life.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All the life.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Love is that always on time.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not in the way you look all the things that you said it through.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All the life.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Love is that always on time.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not in the way you say you're my blue.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not in the way that you came back to me.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not in the way that your love's set free.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's not in the way you look all the things that you said it through.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
All the life.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Love is that always on time.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
All the life.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Love is that always on time.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All the life.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Love is that always on time.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Love is that always on time.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Love is that always on time.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Love is that always on time.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Love is that always on time.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Love is that always on time.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Love is that always on time.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Love is that always on time.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Love is that always on time.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Love is that always on time.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Love is that always on time.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Love is that always on time.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Love is that always on time.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Love is that always on time.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000

Love is that always on time.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When you want to chase me down, I don't know you

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't just hold them cold

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And so soon

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't want to be here, like a close thing in the air

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't want to know you're the stars you've reached my head

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I don't want to know why life's just so unfair

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I don't want to know you

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't just hold them cold

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, you're so damn cool

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can't just hold them cold

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, you're so damn cool

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Cool, and those who are here inside me

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who knows if I'm here or else

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Who knows what you're inside me

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who knows if I'm here or else I'm not

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Guys, why are you so

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We can't leave forever

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Everyone's pretending to be ресpitated

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now you people are dead, don't look in need today

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
All in your brain, but you'll be me

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And you walk in, you don't die in the rain

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
With the way, the arms will sink in the night

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, what is mine in my brain?

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There's the full bar Friday, this is the Daily Source Code

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A 3-4, we're one or not nicotine, caffeine, aspirin and coldine

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And boy, am I feeling full bar and everybody?

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
For whole, we're gonna be doing it all, request later on

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So get ready, of course I believe the ugly kid Joe damn cool

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Was from the open source Daily Source Code, which rolled out last Friday

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When time Warner Cable was muffled by head again

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The Dow was down, the Euro's down, cold is up

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He gives to me, but when I took a good look at me

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And what is the prize?

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The stick of my eyes, good oldies and black

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I remember someone who was taking a two by two

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And lately I've become the one who looked at you too

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There was a flag flag, the one my morning

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There was a flag flag, the one my day

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There was a flag flag, whatever thing you're running

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I was walking back once again, flag flag

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
flag flag

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I walked in the day, my usual way

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Looking for a two by four

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And calling my crew, I could see you

120
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or maybe I just wanted to

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And I remember the time when the sunlight fell on my head

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And lately I've become the one who looked at you too

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There was a flag flag, the one my morning

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There was a flag flag, the one my day

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There was a flag, the one my day

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There was a flag, whatever thing you're running

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was walking back once again, flag flag

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was walking back once again, flag flag

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was walking back once again

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was walking back once again, flag flag flag

131
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And we were walking back once again

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I remember the day when I saw the mask on my face

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And I knew that it was time to put the thing in his face

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I put the black flag on my morning, I put the black flag on my day

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I put the black flag on everything around it

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was walking backwards again, black flag on my morning

137
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Black flag on my day, I put the black flag on everything around it

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was walking backwards again, black flag on my morning

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Black flag on my day, put the black flag on everything around it

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was walking backwards again

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
King's Ex, black flag on my morning, yeah, that was one of those all day for me

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
All kinds of crappy, as lawyer talks, starting at 8 a.m

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
For me, I hate that shit

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We've totally got to roll out some love later on during today's Charlie

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Cause man, I'm in need of some of it

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If you're listening to this on the stream and no agenda stream.com

147
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Log into the chats, join the party, no agenda chat.com

148
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's where it's all going down, looking for the porn stars

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And all my friends are on board on the chat

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You know the name, we call them the Magnificent

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Seven

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Four pairs, knock on my jeans and your bankers too

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Let's get up there and learn those words

154
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When I'm in the crazy team, what's your song or what's it?

155
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I am an event of the M2, turning out a bugle loop

156
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Get you up by the guest, but I'm long can't you keep it up

157
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We can make hold up, can't be so late

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So cheap and we'll fall in pain don't drop in the insets

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We can just bounce next to your pants

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

161
00:13:37,000 --> 00:14:07,000

yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, there is no TD for us, they are all tied, they are like the

163
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,700
guys, they are tied, they are doing the right to grab the ball, it's easy.

164
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Why don't we have friends to take?

165
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
But cups can chip things on the pavement.

166
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Now the news is not to addiction.

167
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
You're the man, you're the bitch, the bitch.

168
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
It's all your monster.

169
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
She's a lot, so it's too few.

170
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Don't get inside the ham, he's gone.

171
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Bitch, a bitch in the car.

172
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
My cowboy's stupid TV left.

173
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
You let it!

174
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Whoa!

175
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

176
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
You let it, stop, stop.

177
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
You let it, stop, stop.

178
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
You let it, stop, stop.

179
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
You let it, stop, stop.

180
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
You let it, stop, stop.

181
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Oh!

182
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
So get back to work and sweat someone.

183
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Because someone will think and forget out the dog.

184
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
This no good for man.

185
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
To work you hate your skin.

186
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
You stop, he's wixing, sweetly, sweetly.

187
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
You're the fuck, you're the sweet.

188
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
But it can't what it's you.

189
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
You let it, stop, stop, stop.

190
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
You let it, stop, stop, stop.

191
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
You let it, stop, stop, stop.

192
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
You let it, stop, stop.

193
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Take your car.

194
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
I don't like you.

195
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Don't you have a stop.

196
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,840
Lock it up the start, get your car, I don't care

197
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Tell the marks, a fire with English came to the ticket at the 711

198
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm so screwed, but he had sex, and those living, and this is a revenge

199
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,440
What have we got?

200
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,480
Yeah, what have we got?

201
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
Yeah, a lot more of that came from today on the Charlie.

202
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,280
The clash, the magnificent seven, got to talk about all kinds of things

203
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,880
going on here at the Hilltop Watch Tower Crackpot Command Center

204
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,280
But first we must recognize that day it is too late.

205
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
One, two, three.

206
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm to eat a son.

207
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Can you provide some?

208
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I need some emotional rescue.

209
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Spin one of those days.

210
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
It's kinda crappy.

211
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,280
We're gonna put the knife on soon, let the knife go

212
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,280
We're gonna change your mind, so we're gonna do

213
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,280
We're doing deep in, you got it out

214
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,280
We're just gonna pull the knife, which makes house

215
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

216
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Don't you know how this is, what never happened to me, it's okay

217
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Just let the knife disappear, it's okay

218
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I've been your savings, the best and true, I come to you, I'm selfish, no rescue

219
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I come to you, no rescue

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Come here, I need that knife that's gone

221
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

222
00:17:48,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

223
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:48,280
yeah, yeah, yeah, you know? E, Incorrect, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there.unky new one, oh right by, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah do yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

224
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Baby man

225
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,280
But I was crying

226
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Love a child

227
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Okay, I was crying

228
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,280
So I love a child

229
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,280
But when I'm in my mind

230
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm in my mind

231
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,280
I'm in my mind

232
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm in my mind

233
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I'm in my mind

234
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
So silent in the night

235
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Sistered in

236
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
I'm in my mind

237
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I've been asleep

238
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Snitting bags that are true

239
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm under your emotion

240
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Rest you

241
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Under your emotion

242
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Rest you

243
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,280
I'm in my mind

244
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Yeah

245
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
It's you

246
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm in my mind

247
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Oh

248
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Yeah, as you quickly mind

249
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Tonight

250
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
With every night

251
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I would be your night

252
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
In shining armor

253
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Coming to your emotion of rest you

254
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
You would be mine

255
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
You would be mine

256
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
You would be mine

257
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
You would be mine

258
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
All of me

259
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I would be your night

260
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Sunshine

261
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Oh

262
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Alrighty

263
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
This is

264
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Maybe it's time to tell you my rolling stone story

265
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
I am hyped up man

266
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,280
This mix of caffeine, esterine, codine, and nicotine

267
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
And of course with an oatmeal throw

268
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Pretty amazing

269
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Here we go

270
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
So

271
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I met Jagger a couple times

272
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
When they released that horrible album

273
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
It included the Harlem shuffle

274
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I went to London to interview them

275
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,280
And the time I was dating a girl at the office

276
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,280
who later went on to become quite a big star

277
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
In the Netherlands on television

278
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Anyway, so we're waiting there

279
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
There's one of these press junks

280
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
It's like going on for hours

281
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
And we're all set up in a hotel room with a camera crew

282
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
No one shows up

283
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
And like 130 in the morning

284
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
It's Woody and Keith

285
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,280
They come rolling in

286
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Literally hammered out of their minds

287
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
And first thing to say

288
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
We got to go into the bathroom

289
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Okay, and so they start snorting co-graph of a bowie knife

290
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Which was interesting to say at least

291
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Add a good little interview there

292
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
And these are early days

293
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Very, very early days

294
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm talking 83 maybe

295
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Something like that

296
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
82

297
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
And it was like hey man, we got to get a picture of you

298
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
And Ron wouldn't keep Richard so

299
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Yeah, we could put that in the newspaper

300
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
And announce the interview

301
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
And it was like oh no one brought a camera

302
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,280
At the time I had one of those very first co-dact disc cameras

303
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Remember those?

304
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
We put like this stupid disc in and it gave you the really shitty quality

305
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I guess my mom had given to me for my birthday

306
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,280
And so I got one of my briefcase

307
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,280
So I whip out the co-dact disc to take a couple pictures

308
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,280
And my producer takes the disc with the film

309
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Back to the

310
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
The state government controlled run press center

311
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Because this is all public broadcasting back in the day

312
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
And for it to be developed

313
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
And then they're going to go you know take those pictures

314
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
And put them in the newspaper

315
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
And that's when I had one of these four had slapping moments

316
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
And I'm like oh crap

317
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I took some pictures of that girl on the co-dact disc

318
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Kind of as a fluke right because I didn't think I'd ever get the film

319
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Developed anyway because there was no one could even develop it

320
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,280
But these were like compromising pictures

321
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
So we had to break into the state government controlled run

322
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
PR department to go retrieve the film

323
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
In the middle of the night

324
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
And I still have the pictures

325
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
This one's by request

326
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Uncle Sam

327
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Brother Ali

328
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
I think you'll dig it

329
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,280
We're going to see if

330
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Tony Jerome and the bag maybe work to sit out

331
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Straighten me out right away

332
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I like it so far man

333
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Yeah

334
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Brother I'm digging it

335
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Come on

336
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Let's go

337
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Welcome to the United States

338
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Land of the sea

339
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Home of the slave

340
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Grand Imperial Guard with a dollar is sacred

341
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Let's do the ship for your come on

342
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Smoke a mirror straight to the stars

343
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Stolen for the cross in the name of God

344
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Bloodsheds in the side, creeping in broad

345
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
But instead of pages that are all good and long

346
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,280
The co-cut in a latched key child ran away

347
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
One day and started acting sad

348
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
King away the wild things are daddy's proud

349
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
But the woman in tired and passed it down

350
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Him poured it in torture

351
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
The work falls to never heal the wounds

352
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
A ship to curse on

353
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
That a grown-up girl like a nation

354
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Holdin' up an artist

355
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
For the part of David, can you feel?

356
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Nothing can save you

357
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
You questioned the rain, you get rushed

358
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
And it rained up

359
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Frist rays, but I must be insane

360
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
Because I can't figure single God

361
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Tamp waiting to change

362
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Who belongs to the United States

363
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Land of the sea, home of the slave

364
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,280
The grand Imperial Guard with a dollar is sacred

365
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
And power is in charge

366
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Land of the sea, home of the slave

367
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,280
The grand Imperial Guard with a dollar is sacred

368
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
And power is in charge

369
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Home of power to the fat and lazy

370
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
The fuck you will blame me

371
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
And ride it and hit me home

372
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Only two generations away

373
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
From the world's most despicable slave

374
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Or if you trade

375
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
I and it's no many ways to the greater human being

376
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
That it can't be changed to this day

377
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Legacy, so ingrained in the wave

378
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
That we think we no longer need change

379
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
To be enslaved

380
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
And all this is a shame

381
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
To dislike, the overseer's even got a rate

382
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
To long the way

383
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Because the children can escape from the pain

384
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
And they bond with the pause in the hatred

385
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
And that veins

386
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Giants separate the man from his soul

387
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
You only strengthen him and lose your own

388
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
We're shoot that fucker

389
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
If you walk and hit a frog

390
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Mind him that this is my own now gone

391
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
We're welcome to the United States

392
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Land of the fleets

393
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
I don't want to say

394
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Grand Imperial Guard with a dollar is sacred

395
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
And power is in charge

396
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Welcome to the United States

397
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Land of fleets

398
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I don't want to say

399
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Grand Imperial Guard with a dollar is sacred

400
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Hold on to me when I have heard

401
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
You give money to the bombs

402
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
On the corner with a sign

403
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Bleeding from their guns

404
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Something about you don't support a crack here

405
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
What's the thing happens to the money from your tax?

406
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Shit the governments to outing

407
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
With a built-in dollar, a weak kill

408
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Prown people, habit

409
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
He's even if you ain't on the front line

410
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
When that's a yell crunch time

411
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
You right back at it

412
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Lay look at how you bustle in backwards

413
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Head to into the year and up

414
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
What they subtracted

415
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Three out as well, must your salary pay for that man

416
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Man, that's a sad man

417
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
See the big ass plasma to see

418
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Where they may damn bad, the point to damn camera

419
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Only a poor question's get answered

420
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,280
I'm stangeless, tough for that national end

421
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Welcome to the United States

422
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Land of fleets

423
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I don't want to say

424
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Grand Imperial Guard with a dollar is sacred

425
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
And power is in charge

426
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Welcome to the United States

427
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Land of fleets

428
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
And power with a dollar is sacred

429
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
And power is in charge

430
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Long to equality

431
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Lol

432
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Do you understand

433
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,960
Man, we passed away

434
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,080
I'm wondering when you get upset

435
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,600
And the other thing is

436
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
What exactly you have?

437
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Is anything to say

438
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm worried about age

439
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,260
And I want to omdat

440
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
That if I don't get upset

441
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Is it mean to piss off your bad

442
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,860
Hey, I did have some good stuff happen this week, um, my of course, uh, or late last week,

443
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,620
idea of time to talk about it because of the, uh, they see my cable went out on what

444
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Thursday.

445
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,940
Yeah, right after the show, actually, right after, uh, no agenda, even on the upload,

446
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,060
I wound up uploading through three G.

447
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:36,100
Tethered on my jailbroken iPhone, uh, but, um, uh, my, uh, iPhone app or iPod Touch app

448
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
launched.

449
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,820
It's called The Big App Show and, uh, holy moly, I got like 70,000 installs in that

450
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,060
first week.

451
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,140
Of course, I was somewhere below the fold on new and noteworthy, and, uh, that really helped.

452
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,460
And shit is working.

453
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
I'm so, I'm so happy.

454
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,620
It's like, uh, I can't believe it.

455
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,860
Now if only I could get a little more promotion for this thing.

456
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,260
If I could go 10 fold, then I could make an actual business out of it.

457
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
I just love it, though.

458
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,820
It's kind of like, you know, being an app J. So now instead of promoting records and promoting

459
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
apps, and it's cool.

460
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,060
I get to pick some cool stuff, and you instead of, uh, musicians behind it, you've

461
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,060
got, uh, engineers and, uh, developers, and I don't know the sum above the just kind of,

462
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I'd like it.

463
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,340
It kind of strikes a chord.

464
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,300
And, uh, folks who are using it definitely like it, so, um, uh, any ideas for promoting

465
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,420
it, you know, it's like it's really hard to do SEO or search engine optimization on an iPhone

466
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
app.

467
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,220
It's like everyone on their mother is trying to do that shit, so, uh, I just got to figure

468
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
it out.

469
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
It's weird.

470
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
I have no idea how it works.

471
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,340
I see apps that are hot and have like three reviews, uh, and don't even have, uh, five

472
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,540
stars and, you know, they're considered to be hot and like, well, how does that work?

473
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,340
So I just really don't know how it works.

474
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,860
But anyway, I'm very excited about that and I've been, uh, pretty busy, uh, putting

475
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,340
together, uh, new episodes as I call them.

476
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,140
So I want to think everyone for the encouragement along the way.

477
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,140
It's been a pretty fun ride and, uh, looking more, uh, looking to do some awesome stuff

478
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
with that.

479
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:13,100
Now, the, um, yeah, thank you very much for a pimping big app show on Twitter.

480
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,580
I appreciate that.

481
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,620
Um, so last time we had the daily source code football Friday, it got into a really

482
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,420
cool place where everyone was like throwing out song ideas and it's just, it was, I was really

483
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,420
into the mood, man.

484
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,540
It just really kind of hit me and so I, we haven't had a lot of suggestions coming

485
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,820
yet on the chat room, but I'm hoping that'll come through.

486
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,260
Uh, I probably have another half hour music and a couple things that I've just been collecting

487
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,580
over the past week and a half that I want to play for you, including a nice little

488
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
mashup.

489
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,860
The odds of the airways is landed and he's sounding good to me.

490
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,820
This is the day he saw Scott with Adam Curry.

491
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,580
He rocks burning down the street, the rainbow went out of the window sound with a sign

492
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
of speech.

493
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,580
She and guns ready to go.

494
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Are you ready?

495
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Hey, are you ready for this?

496
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?

497
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,580
I'll have no way in the bullets to the side of the beat.

498
00:31:39,580 --> 00:32:09,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

499
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:39,580
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, nothing to do, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you. No, no, no, no-no, no, no, no, no,

500
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
I don't have to watch my stuff

501
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,580
You'll fired the bands above you

502
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Yes, we fired the bands above you

503
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
I mean now I'm pumped up

504
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,580
I'm not an animal just fast anymore

505
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,060
Now I'm pumped up

506
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,060
And now I'm pumped up

507
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
No, I'm didn't start

508
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Now I'm pumped up

509
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,580
If maybe somebody has gone to the erle

510
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
I don't know what to do!

511
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
I don't know what to do!

512
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
I don't know what to do!

513
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
I don't know what to do!

514
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
I don't know what to do!

515
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,580
I don't know what to do!

516
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,580
I don't know what to do!

517
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
I don't know what to do!

518
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,580
I don't know!

519
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,580
Man, I kinda liked that when I came across a nice little mashup for you!

520
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Okay, let's do something a little lighthearted, shall we?

521
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,580
As the requests are starting to come in and know agendachat.com.

522
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
I've got some good ones there!

523
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Hey, Mr. Oil, is he your birthday?

524
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Did I miss something here?

525
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Pretty bad if I did!

526
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,580
That would be a shame, wouldn't it?

527
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:17,580
In the sunshine, when we're young as around with the men, it's a shame

528
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,580
In the way you hurt me, it's a shame

529
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,580
When we're young as around with the men, I'm sitting all alone

530
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,580
On the telephone, waiting for your call

531
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:36,580
When you don't call, it's a shame

532
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,580
When you miss around with the men, it's a shame

533
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,580
In the way you hurt me, it's a shame

534
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,580
When you miss around with the men, you're like a child

535
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,580
In the way you hurt me, it's a shame

536
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,580
When you're young as around with the men, I'm sitting all alone

537
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,580
On the telephone, waiting for your call

538
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,580
When you lose me, that's your truth

539
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,580
In the way you want it's a shame

540
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:24,580
When you're young as around with the men, it's a shame

541
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,580
It's such a shame

542
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
The way you mess around with the mess

543
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,580
I tried to speak with you

544
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,580
So you're not so true

545
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,580
But you won't appreciate the love we try to make

546
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,580
All it took got to be a shame

547
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,580
The way you mess around with the mess

548
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,580
I tried to speak with you

549
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,580
So you're not so true

550
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,580
But you won't appreciate the love we try to make

551
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
All it took got to be a shame

552
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
The way you mess around with the mess

553
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,580
I tried to speak with you

554
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,580
And you won't appreciate the love we try to make

555
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,760
The way you mess around with you, make it all

556
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,760
It's a shame that way you hurt me

557
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,040
Oh, it's a shame that you made it

558
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,760
The way you mess around with you, make it all

559
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,080
You got my heart in danger

560
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,560
And I'm not afraid of it

561
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,600
I just can't make up my own

562
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,880
Look at this

563
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,640
Oh, oh, oh, oh

564
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,680
It's a shame, it's a shame that way you hurt me

565
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,680
It's a shame, it's a shame that way you hurt me

566
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,320
That song just makes me happy every single time I hear it

567
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,920
The spinners, it's a shame the way you run around with my heart

568
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,720
On Dayby Source code 834

569
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
It's the footballer Friday, just in the Charlie

570
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
A couple of requests that came in throughout the week

571
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,560
From my buddy Werner, who works

572
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,800
Let's just say he works at a major airport somewhere

573
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Well, let's call it Gibbonation Lowlands

574
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,120
And he actually sent me the track because it wasn't available on iTunes strangely enough

575
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,360
So I asked him to bootleg it for me

576
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,760
He said

577
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,920
And by the way, as you know, moms have priority on this program

578
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,560
You guys have been with me there through us some tough times there says my mom passed away about half a year ago

579
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
And for some reason whenever I hear this song

580
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,280
I always have to think of her this some kind of awesome energy and it and I really would like to hear it on the Charlie

581
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,560
And of course, we will comply gladly and I have to say it is a song that makes

582
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,800
everybody happy, Robbie Williams

583
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:23,600
I don't know how to say it, sorry kids we got no replay

584
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:44,640
I got more than I need when you let's shout out on our own

585
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,400
Are you out of my mind?

586
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,600
Get me with the sound down from the sky

587
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,280
We got to get out of the sky

588
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,040
What did we do when we're due to that?

589
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,280
And if you got no love for me then I'll say goodbye

590
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,880
If you let it change

591
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:46,080
Don't let love be over the change

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
If you want to come make a stand

601
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
It's when it's in your head

602
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,720
We both shall be loud

603
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,720
If you let it change

604
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,720
Don't let love be over the change

609
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,720

Get me with the sound down from the sky

614
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Guys, definitely a musical genius Robby Williams

615
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Let love be your energy

616
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Special request from Warner there and get donation lowlands

617
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
And finally some good songs coming through

618
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,720
So I'm taking the request of no agenda chat dot com

619
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
On iTunes or as I mistakenly typed in the chat room

620
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
I tubes doing that as fast as I can

621
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
Here's something that someone pointed out to me

622
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
As a song that was done 25 years ago

623
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
The message still works today

624
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
It's about Afghanistan

625
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
The place where we ship in drugs from the US military doing that

626
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
On secret cargo flights

627
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
It's all about the oil out there

628
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Not about some stupid dickhead in the cave

629
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
Called Osama bin Laden

630
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
The big scam

631
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Listen to paid vacation

632
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Whoo

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720

644
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Oh, take your sauce cold

645
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
And I'm coming

646
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,720
I know, oh, oh, oh, oh

647
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Gats, you're carrying sauce

648
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
I don't go in

649
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:17,720
You know, they say he'll have no theory like a woman's score

650
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
So vengeful and mother hurt has been done wrong

651
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,720
And I think she's sick

652
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
Yeah, she's keeping up live on her nerves

653
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Trimble along both lines ready to drop

654
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
And in time city you build this thin

655
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
And for us to partner, we build these towers

656
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
A battle in filtre more

657
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
Spoon out of the moment

658
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
They both deposit the children

659
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
A drop in bottles, the risk you reach

660
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
A poverty side, under the collar

661
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Taking prayer out of schools

662
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
And we try to race, college, creation is

663
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
Emerson, the theory of evolution

664
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
Airwater land, mind, body and soul

665
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Pollution kids, stepping on land, mind,

666
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
Smoors, we all lose and we chase and fall

667
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Sighters and racing from our bibles

668
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
The gold and rules are youth

669
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
And we come in more suicide, or who teaches them

670
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
You are not in a wonder, they want to fight

671
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
You race, my hip, but crit you feel like

672
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,720
With a skyscraper's graffiti to sky

673
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,720
And replace a satellite's graffiti to mine

674
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,720
So children with your man-made love

675
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,720
With graffiti to work all us out of hiding on the wall

676
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,720
We got ABC, NBC, MTV, DMTV, DMTV, DMTV, DMTV

677
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,720
HSPSL, A&E, STC, MP3, MCC, D-I-C

678
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,720
N-R-A-G-O-P-A-D-D

679
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,720
The fight for free speech, lack of responsibility

680
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
These are positions of power and our net

681
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,720
For knockers, because in the whole career

682
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,720
The next knock at the door can be tapped

683
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
The caber is to rent the white house

684
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,720
And overseas, race and separate

685
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,720
This vicious militia's mood is the Hindus

686
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
The Muslims, the Christians

687
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Cut it be your biggest marry

688
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Your wrist language, your wrist oil

689
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,720
That imported them home with its leg

690
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Anguish, so cars can deplete the ozone

691
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,720
On highways, the scratch across the land

692
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,720
We're Indians once raised families

693
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,720
We're in denial, the world is afraid

694
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,720
And you say there's no more slaves

695
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Be the land

696
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,720
With skyscrapers, graffiti to sky

697
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,720
And replace the satellites, graffiti to mine

698
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,720
The children with your man-made love

699
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,720
With graffiti to work all us out of hiding on the wall

700
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,720
We're Indians, NBC, MTV, DMTV, DMTV, DMTV

701
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
We're addicted to addiction

702
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720
We did live in a fiction for money, public respect

703
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,720
The army got to go kill the yonder contracts

704
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
We'll let the blinds kill

705
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
The sort of morbid hate in this picture

706
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,720
That I just painted isn't a fit for me

707
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
A hand I realized just how tainted

708
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
I think it really is well in New York

709
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
When I saw a teenager being arrested

710
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
For tagging a fucking wall

711
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,720
Graffiti to land

712
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,720
With skyscrapers, graffiti to sky

713
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,720
And replace the satellites, graffiti to mine

714
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,720
The children with your man-made love

715
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,720
With graffiti to work all us out of hiding on the wall

716
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,720
We're fighting on the wall

717
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,720
With graffiti to land

718
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,720
With skyscrapers, graffiti to sky

719
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,720
And replace the satellites, graffiti to mine

720
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,720
The children with your man-made love

721
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,720
With graffiti to work all us out of hiding on the wall

722
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,720
graffiti to land

723
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,720
With graffiti to land

724
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,720
With graffiti to land

725
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,720
With graffiti to mine

726
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,720
The children with your man-made love

727
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,720
With graffiti to work all us out of hiding on the wall

728
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,720
With graffiti to land

729
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,720
With graffiti to land

730
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,720
With graffiti to land

731
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,720
With graffiti to land

732
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
With graffiti to land

733
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,720
It was actually pretty therapeutic here for me

734
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
It's good I get everything out of my system

735
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Before we do no agenda

736
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,720
So it won't go like freaking nuts and shit

737
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,720
By the way, I've stopped, actually listing everything in the show notes

738
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,720
For the daily source code because I figured these days

739
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,720
It's so incredibly easy to just use shazam or soundhound

740
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,720
Or something like that

741
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
And you can just go get the songs yourself

742
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,720
It's like show notes for almost old fashioned these days

743
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,720
And I do have to admit I was having dinner the other night

744
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
And I shazam this song

745
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
Just because it was such a groove

746
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,720
I'm like crap I haven't heard this in ages, man

747
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Remember the chic chair?

748
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
Do it all together now

749
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,720
You're listening to other colors

750
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
On the dirty source code

751
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,720

752
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720

All right, everybody is old enough to remember that song in the chat room, raise your hand

902
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,920
without talking.

903
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,920
Oh crap, you know that stupid dance we used to do along with a song man?

904
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Well, that's not bad to have a little bit of nostalgia on the show from time to time.

905
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Perhaps I can take you back with another song from the soundtrack of your lives.

906
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Strawberry letter 23.

907
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,920
And without one.

908
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,920
And the DJ used to throw this shit on, we go nuts.

909
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Yeah, the one in his face, because he's got the girl made from his ass.

910
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Time to go back and beat him, make it reggae.

911
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Mix it with your fun.

912
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,920
Brother John's another source code from our Friday.

913
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Hello, my love.

914
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
I heard you kissed me.

915
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,920
The red magic said to play in the air.

916
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,920
Look too.

917
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,920
All through the morning rain I gave.

918
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,920
The sun doesn't shine.

919
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,920
The rain goes in waterfalls.

920
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
Run through my hand.

921
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,920
In the garden, I see.

922
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,920
What's the purple shower belt?

923
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
The blue one's burning.

924
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
The color's interesting.

925
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
Pretty music.

926
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,920
So happy.

927
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,920
I love the blue flowers.

928
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
They come from my channel.

929
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,920
Feel sun shines.

930
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,920
I'm cooking.

931
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,920
A playground for a laugh.

932
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,920
If you try to ask.

933
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Or is it cool?

934
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Or is it cool?

935
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,920
Or is it cool?

936
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,920
If you don't even know CB.

937
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,920
I'm going to be with my baby.

938
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,920
I'm free.

939
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Fly to the home.

940
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,920
All around the city.

941
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,920
Stay with them.

942
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,920
And look at this green.

943
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
See speakers of the sky.

944
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,920
We have never been close.

945
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,920
As long as you can't breathe.

946
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Don't fly high.

947
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Up in the sand.

948
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,920
From here we'll start the baby.

949
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,920
We'll let it run.

950
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,920

say Europe is starting to fall apart or what we know is the European Union better known as the

1048
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:58,680
United States of Europe the euro now dipping below one dollar and twenty cents one nineteen is the

1049

1056
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:04,440
Roman Empire to zero and I think it will also fall not just because of financial coetter

1057
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:12,440
of you know who but because EU politicians penalized citizens by savings and austerity measures

And during the block hands, a first-in-your-never here on the radio.

01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,460
Hit me with your rhythm stick.

1092
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
Over what?

1093
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
I'm ready to come inside

1094
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,600
You look at me as if you're in a date

1095
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,600
It's like the feeling of a humble page with your real life

1096
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,600
You don't know what you just read

1097
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,600
What the world's world

1098
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,600
What no one listens any more

1099
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,600
What no one listens to the world's world

1100
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,600
What no one listens to the world's world

1101
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:06,600
I might as well pull up and come to a wall

1102
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
Who's the world's eye?

1103
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,600
I know what I can call the one thing

1104
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
And my own soul

1105
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,600
That's the left and the left and the left

1106
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,600
It changed the direction

1107
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I know what the story was killing

1108
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,600
You look at the fresh light in the floor of the stage

1109
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,600
I see you like I still

1110
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,600

01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,600
What no one listens any more

1112
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,600
What no one listens to the world's world

1113
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,600
What no one listens to the world's world

1114
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:56,600
What no one listens to the world's world

1115
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,600

1116
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,600

1158
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:11,080
That's exactly the kind of awesome stuff to come out of the chat room when people really

1159
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,080
get into the vibe, missing persons words.

1160
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,880
This is another request we just thought was kind of cute.

1161
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,880
Billy Preston, also known as the fifth needle.

1162
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,160
Billy apparently has a huge cut, by the way, and that's a music industry secret.

1163
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,640
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

1164
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,440
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me.

1165
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,480
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

1166
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,440
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me.

1167
01:14:44,440 --> 01:15:00,040
I'm not gonna try to beat your ego, but that's ego, it's too cool for me.

1168
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:10,200
I'm not tired to beat, so fast, but that minus is too long to see you, yeah.

1169
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,960
I'm not gonna be me.

1170
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,080
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

1171
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,400
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me.

1172
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,360
Don't you remember, I told you.

1173
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,720
I'm not so good in the world, I'm too good in the end, yeah.

1174
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,280
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me, you gotta have something, yeah.

1175

1181
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,200
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me.

1182
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,280
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me, you gotta have something, give me well.

1183
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:23,400
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me, you gotta have something, yeah.

1184
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,760
You gotta have something, if you wanna be me, you gotta have something, yeah.

1185
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,440
You gotta have something, yeah.

1186
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:54,920
Alright, let me get back into the live. There we go. That's better.

1187
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:59,920
I should tell you my Grace Jones story by the way.

1188
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,920
This is a group too.

1189
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,920
Now I'm going through my personal iTunes collection

1190
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,920
to bring out some shit for it.

1191
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,920
Pull up to the bumper baby and ride it into Queens.

1192
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:30,920
I've been down those city streets

1193
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,920

1194
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:39,920

I've been up to the bumper bar from the bumper bar from the bumper base

1197
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:56,920

and you're not having a thing.

1199
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,920

Pull up to Queens.

01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,920
Don't ride.

01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:24,900
Ruby, back in, up while now I'm in my mind

1227
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:32,900
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

1228
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:38,900
I'm all up to God, Ruby, Ruby

1229
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:43,900
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

1230
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:47,900

01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:33,300

01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,900
Remember the word you were wrapping hood?

1239
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:22,900
Words in papers, words in books, words on TV, words for books, words of comfort, words of peace, words to make the fighting cease, words to tell you what to do, words are working hard for you.

1240
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,900
If your words but don't go hungry, words have always nearly hung me.

1241
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,900
Words of nuance, words of skill, and words of romance are a little.

1242
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,900
Words are stupid, words are fun, words can put you on the run.

01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,900
It's okay, I've always heard it.

1248
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,900
This is a word you've never heard.

1249
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,900
Okay, bye.

1250
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,900

on your speakers

1258
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:56,060
We should be able to take this up to the two-hour mark

1259
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,060
I got enough songs to jam it for a while here

1260
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,060
That's what is supposed to be out of group art finding

1261
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:04,060
Now you're making it feel good! Seriously!

1262
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:08,060
I had such a shitty morning and now I'm kind of into the vibe

1263
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:12,060
and feeling just like just like I can really dance!

1264
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:26,060
Whatever happens to you

1265
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:29,060
Liam's trying to scream

1266
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:32,060
He got a nice pick

1267
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:35,060

1276
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:10,060
Are the Shakespeareals

1277
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:14,060
They watch their own man

1278
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:21,060
Whatever happens to you

1279
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:26,060

Now for heroes anymore

No more heroes anymore

1293
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:15,060
No more heroes anymore

1294
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:19,060

Why do I deserve you

1303
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:47,060
Out of the heroes, are the Shakespeare's, they're like their own man

1304
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,060
Whatever comes from the heroes

1305
01:30:56,060 --> 01:31:00,060
Whatever comes from the heroes

1306
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:08,060
No more heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore

No more heroes anymore, no more heroes anymore

1308
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,060
And I think I was 13, I'd be jumping up and down in my room

1309
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,060
Jumping from the couch to the bed, across to my head against the wall

1310
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:27,060
I just love these guys, the sprinklers, no more heroes anymore

1311
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:31,060
What happened to the heroes, they're all gone, we don't have any more heroes

1312
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,060
Where are the heroes?

Sorry about that, little bit of a fire, it's crazy that I'm playing the cash mode

1348
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:14,060
And it's actually sounding a lot like I'm doing some fire radio here, this is nuts man, I love it

1349
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:18,060
You need to do it more often, just take those old records off the show

1350
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:26,060
I've seen listen to him by myself, today's music ain't got the same song

1351
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:34,060
All I've been told to have a rock and roll, don't try to take it to a disco

1352
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,060
You never even give me how I'm wrong

1353
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:45,060
And 10 minutes I've been leap for the dough, stop playing it all time, rock and roll

1354
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:53,060
Still I've been all time, I'm rockin' roll, they can't abuse it just through the song

1355
01:35:54,060 --> 01:36:03,060
I've been listening, I've been feeling all time, I'm rockin' roll, ready for my help out here

1356
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:17,060

1359
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:36,060

1360
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,060
See all the fascists, they'll never do

1361
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:44,060
Today's music ain't got the same song

1362
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:48,060
I left it all till I'm rockin' roll

1363
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:51,060
Still like that old time I'm rockin' roll

1364
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:55,060
The color music just suits us all

1365
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:59,060
I remember some of the days of all

1366
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:03,060
And the full time rockin' roll

1367
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:22,060
Still like that old time I'm rockin' roll

1368
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:26,060
The color music just suits us all

1369
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:30,060
I remember some of the days of all

1370
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:34,060
And the full time rockin' roll

1371
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:37,060
Still like that old time I'm rockin' roll

1372
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,060
The color music just suits us all

1373
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:45,060
I remember some of the days of all

1374
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:49,060
And the full time rockin' roll

1375
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:53,060
Still like that old time rockin' roll

1376
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:57,060
The color music just suits us all

1377
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:01,060
I remember some of the days of all

1378
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:05,060
And the full time rockin' roll

1379
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:09,060
Still like that old time rockin' roll

1380
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,060
Still like that old time rockin' roll

1381
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,060
All right, now I'm officially tired

1382
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,060
Bob, see you getting a silver bullet of bear

1383
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,060
And then the old time rockin' roll

1384
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,060
And now for something that I just need

1385
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:30,060
Because I need to calm down for a moment

1386
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,060
Please sing with me with queen

1387
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,060
Funny Mercury

1388
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,060
Just watching the show

1389
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,060
Over and over again

1390
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,060
You and was tired

1391
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,060
It made up his mind

1392
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,060
To leave his dead life behind

1393
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,060
His boss acts the river

1394
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:00,060
While you'd been up again

1395
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,060
To get those crazy notion

1396
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,060
Right out of your head

1397
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:09,060
Say the hood

1398
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:12,060
Do you think that you are

1399
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:15,060
You should have escaped

1400
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:20,060
I've been ever apart

1401
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:25,060
Spread your wings and fly away

1402
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,060
Fly away

1403
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,060
Fly away

1404
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:36,060
Spread your wings and fly away

1405
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,060
Fly away

1406
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,060
Fly away

1407
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,060
You're still together

1408
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,060
Because you're still together

1409
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:53,060
Just because you're a free man

1410
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:01,060
He spends his evening alone

1411
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:04,060
In his heart there won't

1412
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:07,060
Keep in his mind to himself

1413
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,060
He'd be living soon

1414
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:13,060
Wish that he was my man

1415
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:15,060
Away

1416
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:17,060
Nothing in this world

1417
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:21,060
Nothing in this world

1418
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:31,060
Ooh

1419
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,060
Since he was smart

1420
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:37,060
I've no luck at all

1421
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:41,060
Nothing can be easy to live

1422
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:45,060
Now it was time

1423
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:48,060
He made up his mind

1424
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:52,060
This could be my last chance

1425
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,060
His boss acts the river

1426
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:57,060
Now it's the boy

1427
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,060
You're always dreaming

1428
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,060
You've got the real ambition

1429
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:03,060
You won't get away

1430
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:07,060
Save me by

1431
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:10,060
That you're the way you are

1432
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:13,060
Why can't you be happy

1433
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:17,060
Have to have the rule of life

1434
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:21,060
So what is spread always

1435
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,060
Fly away

1436
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:26,060
Fly away

1437
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,060
Fly away

1438
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:34,060
Spread your wings and fly away

1439
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:37,060
Fly away

1440
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,060
Fly away

1441
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:43,060
You're still together

1442
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:46,060
Because you're still together

1443
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:51,060
Because you're free man

1444
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:55,060
Come on honey

1445
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,060
Come on honey

1446
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:25,060
Come on honey

1447
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:47,060
I've met a lot of people throughout the years

1448
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:50,060
And some of them are no longer with us

1449
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:53,060
Because one of those people who I really miss

1450
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,060
Oh man

1451
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,060
And we knew for so long that he was sick

1452
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:58,060
And we were like swarmed as secrecy

1453
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:00,060
And it was just horrible just seeing him

1454
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:04,060
Just seeing him go down the tubes

1455
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,060
Yeah

1456
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:07,060
Cool

1457
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,060
I'm tired

1458
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:10,060
But I'll play a song for you

1459
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,060
That I was looking for

1460
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:16,060
I would be probably

1461
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,060
I think probably close to 10 years

1462
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:21,060
And I would request it from record companies

1463
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:23,060
And they would you know it was weird

1464
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:25,060
Because like a one-hit wonder

1465
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,060
You're going to laugh when you hear the song of course

1466
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:30,060
And it finally showed up on iTunes

1467
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:33,060
And this is a song

1468
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,060
That when I was in the

1469
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:37,060
See I think it was junior high

1470
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,060
Yeah

1471
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:41,060
It was like you know when your hormones are raging

1472
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:45,060
And this I one girl that you're like really crazy about

1473
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:48,060
Of course I won't look at you because you're a total dork

1474
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:52,060
And the lyric from this song

1475
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:55,060
Which always got me was

1476
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,060
I'd ride with you

1477
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:59,060
On the handlebars

1478
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:01,060
You'd laugh from runaway

1479
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,060
Well you'll hear it when you hear the LSE brothers

1480
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:07,060
I'd like to stay in love

1481
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,060
With you

1482
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:14,060
All summer and after I'll keep

1483
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:19,060
You weren't through the weather

1484
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:22,060
You've forgotten it's one day

1485
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:25,060
You're saying those love play

1486
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:33,060
Like the ride my heart is so good

1487
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,060
With you

1488
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:38,060
On the handlebars

1489
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,060
You'll have to run away

1490
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:44,060
You've forgotten it's one day

1491
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:47,060
You're saying those love play

1492
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,060
You've forgotten it's one day

1493
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:00,060
All summer and after I'll keep

1494
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:02,060
You've forgotten it's one day

1495
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:05,060
You've forgotten it's one day

1496
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,060
You're saying those love play

1497
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:38,060
To love you, to love you, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it

1498
01:45:38,060 --> 01:46:07,380
to love it, to love it, to love it, and love it, to love it, you love it to love it, to love it, to love it, to love it, and love that I'm not a bitch for that I love it, and wish that to love it, and be on it.

1499
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:43,060
Deep breath is breathing so low

1500
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:48,060
When we tear our seeds all the way

1501
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:54,060
Flouring, feeling the epic orange again

1502
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:59,060
For again, all the way

1503
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:04,060
Deep breath is breathing so low

1504
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:09,060
When we tear our seeds all the way

1505
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:15,060
Flouring, feeling the epic orange again

1506
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:41,060
She gets hungry, but dinner and it

1507
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:47,060
She loves the dinner, doesn't come late

1508
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:52,060
She'd never bother with anyone she'd hate

1509
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:57,060
And that's why the lady is a tramp

1510
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:04,060
Doesn't like dice games with barrens and herbs

1511
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:10,060
Well, go to Harlem, festin' irmin' and pearls

1512
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:15,060
Will not dish the dirt with a rest of those girls

1513
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:20,060
And that's why this chick is a tramp

1514
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:27,060
It's up to the free, cool, with the rest

1515
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:32,060
Life without doubt, she's broke

1516
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:36,060
But it's so, doesn't like California

1517
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:39,060
It's cold and it's damp

1518
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,060
That's why the lady is a tramp

1519
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,060
She gets far too hungry, babe

1520
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:51,060
We bet for dinner and it's

1521
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:57,060
She adores the dinner, doesn't come late

1522
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:02,060
She'd never bother with someone she'd hate

1523
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:07,060
And that's why the lady is a tramp

1524
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:14,060
Doesn't like dice games with barrens and herbs

1525
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:18,060
Never makes a trick up to Harlem diving

1526
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:21,060
Shiny Lincoln's in court

1527
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:27,060
She won't dish the dirt with a rest of those girls

1528
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:31,060
That's why this chick is a tramp

1529
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:34,060
She loves the free, fine, wild knockout

1530
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:38,060
Kube Kube, groovy with dinner hair

1531
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:41,060
Life without a care

1532
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:47,060
She's broke, but it's so, she loves California

1533
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:50,060
It's cold and it's damp

1534
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:55,060
That's why the lady is a tramp

1535
01:49:55,060 --> 01:50:00,060
That's why the lady is a tramp

1536
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:03,060
Turn the bar, live with medicine, square garden

1537
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:05,060
I've got the entire album, you should know

1538
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:07,060
And it's one of my favorites, especially the overture

1539
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:12,060
The opening with Howard Kossel, but that may be for a different daily source code

1540
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:17,060
Let me keep you in the vago some songs you never ever ever hear on the radio

1541
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,060
But it's a part of your education

1542
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:23,060
Some are journeys tonight, agra, and you're one of the places

1543
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:30,060
I've been all our kids, we'll save our friends

1544
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:34,060
I've a cozy little flat in what is known

1545
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:38,060
As old man hadn't, we'll settle down

1546
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:43,060
Right here in town

1547
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:46,060
We'll have man hadn't

1548
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:50,060
The Bronx and Staten Island too

1549
01:50:50,060 --> 01:51:00,060
It's lovely going through the Sioux

1550
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:07,060
It's very fancy, on all the fancy street you know

1551
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:12,060
The subway charms are so

1552
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:18,060
When bombing breezes blow to and fro

1553
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:24,060
And tell me what street compares with my street into life

1554
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:28,060
Sweet push cards gently glide

1555
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:32,060
Ding-bye

1556
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:37,060
The great big cities of wonder store

1557
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:42,060
Just make for a girl and boy

1558
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:50,060
We'll turn that hat into an island of joy

1559
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,060
We'll go to yankers

1560
01:51:53,060 --> 01:51:57,060
Where true love conquers in the wild

1561
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:02,060
And starve together dear

1562
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:07,060
In chiles

1563
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:10,060
We'll go to Coney

1564
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:14,060
And eat baloney on a roll

1565
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:18,060
In central park we'll stroll

1566
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:22,060
Where our first kiss we stole

1567
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:24,060
So do so

1568
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:30,060
And my family is a terrific show they say

1569
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:35,060
We both may see it close

1570
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:38,060
Someday

1571
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:44,060
The city's glamour can never spoil

1572
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:48,060
The dreams of a boy and girl

1573
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:54,060
We'll turn man hadn't into an island of joy

1574
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,060
That's right

1575
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:58,060
I'm just a little bit dismayed at the chat room

1576
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:00,060
Not knowing who this is

1577
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:04,060
How can you how dare you not know the voice

1578
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:08,060
Without a doubt the voice of an entire era

1579
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:10,060
Elef it's Gerald

1580
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:13,060
Oh my gosh, I can't believe you guys didn't know that

1581
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:16,060
How about this one then?

1582
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:18,060
Surely you from the 70s rule

1583
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:20,060
Remember this one

1584
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:22,060
Little clowny guy

1585
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:24,060
And we made fun of it in get monation

1586
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:25,060
East on big brother

1587
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:30,060
I hated some good tunes before I became a joke

1588
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:34,060
This one is without a doubt one of the best songs ever written

1589
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:37,060
Leo Sayer on the Charlie

1590
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:39,060
For a funny version

1591
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:43,060
When I need you

1592
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:49,060
I just close my eyes and I'm with you

1593
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:56,060
And all that I saw on a give you

1594
01:53:56,060 --> 01:54:02,060
It's only a heartbeat away

1595
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:06,060
When I need love

1596
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:12,060
I hold out my hands and I touch love

1597
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:19,060
I never knew that was so much love

1598
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:25,060
Keep in me one night and day

1599
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:31,060
Miles of miles of empty space in between us

1600
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:37,060
The telephone can't take place all your smile

1601
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:45,060
But you know I won't be traveling forever

1602
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:48,060
It's cold out but hold out

1603
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:55,060
And do like I do when I need you

1604
01:54:55,060 --> 01:55:02,060
I just close my eyes and I'm with you

1605
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:08,060
And all that I saw on a give you bay

1606
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:15,060
It's only a heartbeat away

1607
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:21,060
It's not easy when the road is to a driver

1608
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:26,060
On it that's a heavy load that we bear

1609
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:34,060
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime

1610
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:37,060
It's cold out but hold out

1611
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:43,060
And do like I do when I need you

1612
01:55:51,060 --> 01:56:06,060
I just close my eyes and I'm with you

1613
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:10,060
When I need love

1614
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:16,060
I hold out my hands and I touch love

1615
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:23,060
I never knew that was so much love

1616
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:29,060
Keep in me one night and day

1617
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:33,060
When I need you

1618
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:40,060
I just close my eyes

1619
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:47,060
And you know I won't be traveling

1620
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:53,060
Keep in me one night and day

1621
01:56:53,060 --> 01:57:01,060
I just hold out my hands and I'm with you

1622
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:09,060
And all that I saw on a give you

1623
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:19,060
It's only a heartbeat away

1624
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:22,060
All right you're listening to all hit radio

Baby

1643
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:13,060
In your mind you have capacities you know

1644
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:19,060
To tell a path messages through the vast unknown

1645
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:23,060
Please close your eyes and concentrate

1646
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:26,060
With every thought you think

1647
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:31,060
Upon the recitation

1648
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:37,060
When we're about to say

1649
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:44,060
Calling occupants are the deplinatory craft

1650
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:49,060
Calling occupants are the deplinatory

1651
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:52,060
Most extraordinary craft

1652
01:58:55,060 --> 01:59:00,060
Calling occupants are the deplinatory craft

1653
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:07,060
Calling occupants are the deplinatory craft

1654
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:14,060
Calling occupants are the deplinatory craft

1655
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:17,060
Calling occupants are the deplinatory craft

1656
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:21,060

To send the message we need to say I will contact you

1679

Go away my happiness, I've been to a planetary ground
