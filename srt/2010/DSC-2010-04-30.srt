3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're not in the state.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We've been dreaming of life.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know you're in the strip down.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey, come here.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
C'mon.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
C'mon.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right, everybody.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a group of our friends.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Daily source codec was sold in 3-0.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're always as quick as time.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Noisyinestream.com was with the parties.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There's no agenda chat.com.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you ready?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He lived in the jungle when he was born the King.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
His great strength made him a lot of effort, been.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No creature crossed his path that lived for long.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
His name, so let it tell us what it can't call.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He was never an issue.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was great, but jungle's shopping is this magic way.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
His eyes were muscle, there's the other three.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This temple was big and wide as it could be.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Come on, Zombie!

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie!

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie!

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He didn't notice somebody. He spoke sometimes but hardly.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When women heard his love call, he was still beginning to die.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
One day while Kong was sleeping on his back,

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
a surrender starts, lunch the sneaker time.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They fought, first come with down, then up again.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The fight went off, no one knew what would win.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How reached and seized the muscle with both hands.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then summoned all the strength and his command.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He stretched the creatures mouth to the split.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then locked the child again to play with him.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He didn't notice hearing chest and left around.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Five miles away they heard his running sound.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie! Come on, Zombie!

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on, Zombie! He didn't notice somebody.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,500
He's focused on his blood hardly

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
One woman heard his love call

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But he was too big and too tired

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
From everyone he knew he got rid of his pants

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Will it fail to give it?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He corrected

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Nobody across this path and left alone

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
His name, something to tell this was King Kong

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
