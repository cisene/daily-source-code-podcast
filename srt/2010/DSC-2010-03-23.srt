00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 8-2-3!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're 16 months to 7 minutes and shooting five nons of time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are way nons.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We can't get any of our lives.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know you're the strength of your honesty.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a battle curry.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't you got to let me know.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Should I stay or should I go?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you say that you are mine,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll be here till the end of time.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So you've got to let me know.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Should I stay or should I go?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's always days, days, days, days.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're happy when I'm on my knees.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One day is fine and next is black.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So if you want me of your back,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Welcome on and let me know.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Should I stay or should I go?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Should I stay or should I go now?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Should I stay or should I go?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Should I stay or should I go?

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you say that you are mine,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Show me what you know.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Should I stay or should I go?

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Should I stay or should I go?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Should I stay or should I go?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let me know.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're happy when I'm on my knees.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know which clothes even fit me

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Come on and let me know

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Should I cool it or should I blow

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It'll get on me

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I see you

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know which clothes even fit me

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come on and let me know

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Should I stay on Shura Go down

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Should I stay on Shura Go down

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Should I pull it on?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Should I pull it on?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If I stay here will be tough

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Should I cool it or should I blow

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:14,760
It is daily source code episode 823.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,340
We are on the air, just about everywhere, global transmission starts now on no agenda

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
stream.com.

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,380
If you are listening and you are near a computer, please, it is up at the chat room, it is

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,180
all the fun, it is no agenda.com.

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:35,620
2 of the show that is back, I think the question the class asked us to answer, I think

51
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,740
I should stay, and you know what, it is like all of a sudden the show is just kind of getting

52
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,700
ready to roll out of me, I am ready to go, didn't even have to do all that much prep, although

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,180
I would like a little more pot-save music, I do have a couple tracks coming up for you later

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,260
on, and we are going to be talking about a number of things.

55
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:02,420
In the vein of laying it all out there, open source divorce on the chuckle today, that

56
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,700
should be interesting, got a couple of old familiar voices, he will be back, and yes, one

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:15,300
counted one promo that I will play for you, for the next hour, the source code is

58
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,700
back and in your face, and this is the outstanding long version of this song which you

59
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:33,100
never hear on the radio anywhere, which is why it deserves to be heard, deep inside your

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:42,820
membranes, jam in the plugs, Martin Offers got it for you, let it reverberate, it will

61
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:26,100
be heard, that's the way to do it, you play the guitar on your TV, I am working, that's the way to do it,

62
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:33,100
you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV, I am working, that's the way to do it,

63
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:41,100
you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV,

64
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,100
you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV,

65
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,100
you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV,

66
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,100
you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV, you play the guitar on your TV, trust yourself,

67
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:08,100
you play the guitar on their TV, you play the guitar on their TV, you play the guitar on his TV, you play the guitar on your TV,

68
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:17,100
you played the guitar on their TV, you play the guitar on his TV, you play the guitar on their TV, you play the guitar

69
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,100
on their TV, you play the guitar on their TV, you play the guitar on their TV, you play the guitar on their TV,

70
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,760
See howtime moves brings as you wait a 3 minute

71
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,700
Broza, move, here's Color TV

72
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,600
Oh, right

73
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,780
Oh, up we mind

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,620
Go í‘¹

75
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,940
Snow right, where is

76
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,940
As I put you in the middle of the road

77
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,940
It's got to move me to the refrigerator

78
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,940
I've got to move me to the refrigerator

79
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Look at you

80
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I should have been to play the guitar

81
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,940
I should have learned to play the drums

82
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Look at that mama, she got it

83
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Thinkin' in the camera, I met her

84
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
I look at her, so

85
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
And he's up there, what's there?

86
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Come while you know it's us

87
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,940
You're bringing on a bundle like this

88
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Oh, that's a ring

89
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
That's the way you're doing it

90
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
You're doing it for nothing, it's a chick

91
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
It's so free

92
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,940
We've got to be strong like a wave of the moon

93
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Because you catch it, you're never ready

94
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,940
We've got to move me to the refrigerator

95
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,940
We've got to move me to the refrigerator

96
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Yeah

97
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Listen, yeah

98
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,940
That ain't working

99
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,940
That's the way you're doing it

100
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,940
You play the guitar on the empty thing

101
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,940
That ain't working

102
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
That's the way you're doing

103
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

104
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

105
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Six, four, three, I'm free

106
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

107
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:42,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

108
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,940
One, two, one, four, nothing

109
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Six, four, three, I'm free

110
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

111
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Six, four, three, I'm free

112
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Six, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

113
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Six, four, three, I'm free

114
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

115
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your lips, I'm free

116
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,940
One, two, one, four, nothing in your cheeks, I'm free

117
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,940
Two, one, two, one, four, nothing in your lips, I'm free

118
00:09:30,940 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on

119
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:30,940
it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, and I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm oh, on it, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on there on it

120
00:10:30,940 --> 00:11:00,900
Okay, I'm getting complete.

121
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:06,020
Thanks for the chat room, and I had Twitter that the stream is in Mono once again today.

122
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,040
It's something that I definitely have to figure out because there's nothing like hearing

123
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,960
mock-knock-flur in stereo.

124
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,980
Oh, oh, I'm in dire straits, I just think you're showing up again.

125
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,020
In the extended version of money for nothing, chicks for free.

126
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,620
Which I'd say is kind of what we expected with podcasting back in the day, isn't it?

127
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
At least I did.

128
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,900
I thought, hey, it's gonna be great.

129
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:34,380
Now what we got to do is just do some shows, and the money I'll show up.

130
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,860
And of course, didn't turn out exactly that way, but I do want to correct something.

131
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,420
I said, on the source code, on, was it Friday, the Football Friday edition.

132
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:51,260
Dave Winner actually was right that podcasting and blogging may not necessarily result directly

133
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,860
in money, but it does give you ways to make money.

134
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,820
In association with your programming.

135
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,660
And I do want to mention that is exactly what Mivia was finally stumbled upon.

136
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,060
And if you want to know more, then hit me up with an email and I will forge over to Brian

137
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,260
Callwell and he'll definitely let you know how we do it.

138
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,900
So although you may not make revenues directly, it's definitely important.

139
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,180
I'm gonna play one more song, which is an amazing mashup from Rock Sugar.

140
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,460
Oh, just got turned on to have never heard of these guys before, but meant they are awesome.

141
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,900
They do the mashups in a new jacket.

142
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,460
Kind of live.

143
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,180
It'll blow you away when you hear what they've done.

144
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,700
Don't stop the salmon.

145
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,700
Damn it!

146
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,020
Oh yeah!

147
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,100
You.

148
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:36,180
Just to sit at home, for the rest of the stuff it's just,

149
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:44,180
It's worth of me not trailing the new way.

150
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:03,180
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:10,180
I see the wind, the smoke and the moon,

152
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,180
The smell of the ship I've been through,

153
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,180
From the sky I've seen every night,

154
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,180
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the night,

155
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,180
I've seen the wind, the smoke and the moon,

156
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,180
The smell of the ship I've been through,

157
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,180
From the sky I've seen every night,

158
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:42,180
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark,

159
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,180
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark,

160
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,180
In the dark, in the dark, in the light,

161
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,180
In the darkäº›, we're in love with this boring world!

162
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,460
I can't talk about your spirituality,

163
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,180
It's just, you're right, I will pretend I can no longer...

164
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Just some way long life.

165
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,180
Who are you?

166
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,180
Who are you?

167
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:43,180
So we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're

168
00:15:43,180 --> 00:16:13,180
losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're loses, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing, so we're losing

169
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,900
Oh, never, never lane.

170
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:40,380
How was that, how was that I smell, I love you?

171
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,120
Deep white.

172
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Keep on going.

173
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Don't stop.

174
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Keep on going.

175
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Keep on going.

176
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Band us called Rock Sugar.

177
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
This track don't stop the same man.

178
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
I've got a whole album filled with mash-ups like this.

179
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,120
As far as I can tell, they've completely replayed,

180
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,120
we've mastered done everything all over again.

181
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,120
And I just love it.

182
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
It's fantastic.

183
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
I had to actually rip that off of a YouTube video.

184
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I'm going to put links in the show notes.

185
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
You can find those at dailysourcecode.com.

186
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
And I've ordered their album and you can't download it.

187
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
It's not available on iTunes.

188
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
You're going to only get the physical product.

189
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
But I wanted to play this for you so badly.

190
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
I couldn't wait until I got the album.

191
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,120
I'm sure that I will be playing more from their CD in episodes to come.

192
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
They've got a lot of...

193
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,120
And they do live shows, too, which is perfect for the old people amongst us.

194
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,120
So yeah, just going back to making money with alternative media.

195
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
There's so many different ways to do it.

196
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,120
But I have to say it's no one going to come from the old fashioned way of,

197
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,120
hey, you only can go through one gate, one gate of mainstream goodness,

198
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
deliver through to your television or radio.

199
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,120
And therefore lots of people have forced the listen to it.

200
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,120
No, we have much smaller audiences in much smaller.

201
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I'd have to say compared to the way it used to work.

202
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,120
But you can do a lot of things in conjunction with your show.

203
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,120
And sometimes it's just provide relevance to the business that you're doing next to it.

204
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,120
So besides the ever pervasive GoDaddy codes,

205
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,120
which I will be putting GoDaddy codes back into the show notes at dailysourcecode.com as a part of the show.

206
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,120
The only way I really asked to support this program is by supporting the project that John and I are,

207
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,120
you know, putting together essentially is no agenda stream.com,

208
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,120
which we believe we can build into something of significant value.

209
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,120
And if you find value in no agenda stream.com, then go to devorac.org slash NA S.

210
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,120
And that's where you can donate to the stream become a sustaining producer to keep it going.

211
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,120
And we're actually hiring people to do stuff, which actually does cost money.

212
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Coming to you from the hilltop watch tower once again today.

213
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
It's a beautiful day in Southern California.

214
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,120
The people's Republic that is in Los Angeles.

215
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,120
And I want to talk to you about a couple of things today.

216
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
One of them is this incredible experience I've been going through,

217
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
which of course is nothing new for many people.

218
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
They go through separation divorce.

219
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
It happens all the time.

220
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Unfortunately, a very high percentage of people talk about that on a 22.

221
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,120
But for the past, gosh, it must be seven or eight months.

222
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
I've been working with Patricia's lawyers.

223
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,120
And I have to say lawyers because she's gone through three of them at this point,

224
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,120
although I begged for a form of mediation, which I thought would be much easier.

225
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,120
And she actually had a lawyer who pretended like she was coming in as a mediator.

226
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
And then all of a sudden turned into her lawyer.

227
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,120
And I actually, I had a lawyer for like two weeks.

228
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
And then I fired him.

229
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I said, dude, you know, forget about this.

230
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm not going to waste any money on you.

231
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,120
And I still beg Patricia not to waste money on these stupid lawyers because they are so evil.

232
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
In this process.

233
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Because we talk, you know, we have conversations.

234
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,120
I picked up Christina from her house when I took over to London a couple weeks ago.

235
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
And we actually had a pretty good chat.

236
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,120
And, you know, we've been principle agreed on, hey, let's just split everything up.

237
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Whatever that is, that's fine.

238
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,120
And I've been nothing but easy.

239
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Because I feel she deserves half of everything that we built up together.

240
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,120
But then you get these asshole lawyers.

241
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
And I have to generalize.

242
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm sorry.

243
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Certainly it comes to divorce attorneys.

244
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
And they're just crazy.

245
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
I spent, you know, and so I've done so many contracts.

246
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
And that's what a divorce is.

247
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
You know, at the end of the day, there will be a piece of papers settlement agreement.

248
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
And it'll be filed in California.

249
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
And it's very simple.

250
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,120
There's no fault divorce in the state of California.

251
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,120
It'll be under irreconcilable differences, which is correct.

252
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:22,120
And, you know, talking for seven, eight months answering long letters and, you know, going into detail.

253
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
And by the way, the internet is great.

254
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Because you can look everything up.

255
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,120
You know, lawyers in general, I think, are just translating a different language.

256
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
And takes and work off your hands.

257
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,120
But I, yeah, I felt it was very important to be, you know, personally involved in this whole process.

258
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
And understand exactly what they're saying.

259
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
And maybe we can learn something from it all.

260
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:52,120
And so I went through seven or eight months of basically bringing it down to, you know, to two very simple items.

261
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,120
One really is, you know, I think a lot of you know, that all of the bank accounts, everything was in her name.

262
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,120
She has control over all of that. She moved out of the,

263
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,120
um, our place in London and took everything.

264
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I have some boxes arriving with my studio, by the way, that's been salvaged.

265
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Wait for that to, we're that to arrive.

266
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Then I can definitely get the stream back in stereo.

267
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,120
And, you know, my books and my nicknakes, that's essentially, that's kind of what life is boiled down to.

268
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,120
My books, my studio equipment and my nicknakes, which is like my, you know, my, my star trek communicator.

269
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah, important stuff like that.

270
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Oh, and by the way, the machine gun that my grandfather brought back the Japanese submachine gun.

271
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,120
He brought about it from the South Pacific, which I do want to talk about later as well.

272
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:54,120
So we go through months of back and forth and, you know, then the lawyers are, well, here's the family code and they look up the family code and, you know, you can answer that stuff.

273
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,120
It's not that hard, really. It's not that scary.

274
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,120
But what we're so disappointing is,

275
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,120
then all of a sudden, you know, you get a draft settlement agreement.

276
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,120
And everything we discussed for the past eight months is all still in there.

277
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
All the things we agreed upon is all turned back.

278
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:20,120
And now it's basically starting all over again, because yet another law firm has to be involved in the United States.

279
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
And it's just, you know, they're just ripping off.

280
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,120
They're ripping her off. And of course, you know, nothing I say is,

281
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
is going to convince anybody of that.

282
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,120
It's just more time. It's unbelievable, unbelievable.

283
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Of course, I'm very happy that she's doing quite okay. Certainly financially.

284
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,120
She has no issues whatsoever. She's never had a problem with that.

285
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
And I just hope we can get all of this behind us.

286
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
And everybody can move on and we'll be done with it.

287
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,120
And then eventually the press will die down, which has been very,

288
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,120
whoa, that's a big helicopter, which has been very challenging in all of this.

289
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,120
I mean, it's one thing to separate. It's another thing to separate with a lot of media attention.

290
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Because, you know, you have to catch yourself.

291
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,120
It's like, you know, you'll read something like, I never said that to anybody.

292
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I didn't talk to any journalist. And then you read something else from the, from the other side.

293
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
And you're like, I can't believe she said that. You gotta wait a minute.

294
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Wait a minute. That's probably not true.

295
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:25,120
So the smartest thing I think we've both done is make sure that we are able to,

296
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,120
basically ask each other, hey, did you say that? Did you mean that?

297
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
And so, you know, it's a dichotomy.

298
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,120
On one hand, on the personal side, things are kind of going along pretty well.

299
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,120
But on the legal side, they're just drawing it out and making an expensive stupid process.

300
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Anyway, my dear friend, Angie B, who sent a comment to me, by the way,

301
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,120
which I want to play for in a second, also sent me along a song.

302
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,120
And I definitely want to play that for you, because it's very appropriate.

303
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
And not only that, but it's pod safe.

304
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,120
And it is one half of everything, but the girl, which I've always appreciated as a,

305
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,120
I guess as a band, and I always thought they were pretty awesome.

306
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
It's Tracy Thorne.

307
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,120
This is appropriately titled, Oh, the divorces.

308
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,120
The words will mean a bit to you, I think.

309
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Who's next? Who's next?

310
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Always the ones that you least expect.

311
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,120
They see in so strong.

312
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,120
And turn out she wants it more all along.

313
00:25:47,120 --> 00:26:02,120
And each time I hear a host part, I examine my heart.

314
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,120
See how it stands.

315
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Wonder if it's still in safe hands.

316
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Who's friend? Who's friend?

317
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Who's been caught out in somebody's bed?

318
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:42,120
I should have guessed that day that his phone wouldn't take you text.

319
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,120
He was a gentleman, I wish him back home.

320
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,120
I wonder who he shouldn't take sight.

321
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,120
But that one was his fault.

322
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
This one is her fault.

323
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,120
No one gets off without paying the ride.

324
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:16,120
And I wonder why the divorce is.

325
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:43,120
And the honeymoon, the wedding rings.

326
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:56,120
The afternoon handovers by the swings.

327
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Huyens. Huyens.

328
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,120
His songs seem to look through different bands.

329
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Your still so young.

330
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,120
The romance just as easy as it's begun.

331
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Now let's kids to tell.

332
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
And the girls.

333
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,120
I'm cast to hear.

334
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,120
This one's different.

335
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,120
And each one of course is.

336
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,120
And always the same.

337
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:54,120
The divorce is.

338
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Who's next?

339
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:15,720
He's nice.

340
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,480
Tracy Thorn, oh the divorce is pod safe and you can download this track from her website.

341
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,160
Thank you so much, Angie B for turn me on to that.

342
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,080
I want to grace song that is.

343
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,880
And it says that it's all right there.

344
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,440
In fact, I need a little bit of love right now.

345
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,480
I need Angie to bring me the sexy back.

346
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
Hey baby.

347
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,280
Hey, Adam, it's Angie B.

348
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,720
Thanks so much for including me and the DSC last week, just wanted to share some of my thoughts.

349
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,000
My posts of the show up on my Facebook and Twitter and, you know, it seemed to inspire

350
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,400
a lot of conversation, heard from some of the old media folks I hadn't talked to in a

351
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,480
while, from one who had stopped podcasting and said he was inspired to get back into it.

352
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,560
I think he contacted you privately as well.

353
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,280
Also talked to some folks about pod safe music and, you know,

354
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,240
Angie, before you keep going, thank you so much for that Tracy Thorn track.

355
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,520
Because I would really like to do so much more with, with pod safe music.

356
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,920
But I also want to make a show that's really entertaining.

357
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,620
A lot of music out there in general is crap, pod safe and not, but please go to pod

358
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,400
safe music network.com.

359
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,280
If you're an artist, read how the system works is pretty simple.

360
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,800
You upload your tracks, you make them available for all the podcasters and other alternative

361
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:40,960
media producers to use them and give you credit and help you basically promote your stuff.

362
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
And I think we've pretty much proven that this works.

363
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,080
I still see 20 to 30 new tracks going up every single day.

364
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,280
I'm just looking for more fun stuff to play.

365
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
So keep it coming.

366
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,680
Gosh, you're such an inspirational guy.

367
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,880
I think that's is why we all miss the DSC.

368
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,800
There's just that personal human quality that you've always had in the DSC and you had

369
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,880
it in spades last week and really just the show left me at the smile on my face the rest

370
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
of the day.

371
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,200
I just get, you know, remembering old times and feeling all warm and fuzzy and it's just so nice

372
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,840
to have the DSC back.

373
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
I say, take it slow, don't overdo it, don't get back into every day thing, just do it

374
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,320
when you're feeling it and we're going to feel it too.

375
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
And I just want to say we appreciate you, man.

376
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Oh, Angie.

377
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Oh.

378
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,000
Now, I'm going to take it to a home or the level I love you.

379
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,800
You know that, especially love your voice, check out Angie at the chill cast.

380
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,560
Well, you know what, a lot of influences, a lot of reasons why I brought the source code

381
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
back.

382
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,680
And I am doing it totally when I feel like it and I've changed a lot of things in my life,

383
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,680
you know, now I'm living in Los Angeles, still going up to San Francisco a couple of times

384
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,640
a month to be in the office and contributing there, what I can't I can do a lot obviously

385
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,600
being in the same time zone through phone and Skype, which of course I did for four years

386
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
from London.

387
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,960
So, makes a lot of sense there.

388
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,560
I think I mentioned on the previous show that I've been, I've got this new book, ADD.

389
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm able to read five books simultaneously once again.

390
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm trying to pair that down to three, but I'm doing pretty good with the five.

391
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,520
And one of the things that that I think really hit me, one of the books that really brought

392
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,800
me back to what I wanted to do with the source code, now that I can really talk about

393
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,000
everything and I feel open enough to talk to you guys about everything, that's going on

394
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,800
in my life, which really works is this book called Authenticity by James H. Gilmore and

395
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,600
B. Joseph Pine II, who are the authors of the experience economy.

396
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,600
And the book actually has a subtitle, what consumers really want.

397
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,960
And it is authenticity and, you know, the DSC has always been a playground, so once again,

398
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,760
you are in my guinea pigs and I'm just trying to give you 100% authenticity.

399
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
And I think it works.

400
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
It really does.

401
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,960
Now, I've always been as authentic and real as possible on this show, but, you know, often

402
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,160
a lot of things have been going on that I really just couldn't talk about it and feel

403
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
as appropriate.

404
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,800
And I think I'm over that, which is really nice, really is.

405
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,160
So let me say one other thing then, which I see is a topic in the chat room, not right

406
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:28,160
now at noagendachat.com, remember when we do the show live, it goes out on noagendastream.com,

407
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:35,120
is about the health care bill and I'm going to make it real simple.

408
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,480
If we believe the system works the way it should work and I'm just going to have to have

409
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,720
some belief in that, then a majority, albeit a slim majority, a majority of the country

410
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:54,200
through their representatives in government, I know it's all disputable and debatable,

411
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,640
but that's maybe something for noagenda.

412
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,280
They voted for this health care bill.

413
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,040
Now, I believe that the public was poorly informed and perhaps, say, we're even lied

414
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:10,160
to, certainly words matter and when you say that the congressional budget office says that

415
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,760
this will reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars over the next two decades, that is definitely

416
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:24,360
bending the truth as the CBO is said, it might affect the deficit in the second decade

417
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
by a trillion dollars.

418
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
They have not explicit.

419
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,120
They don't even calculate past 10 years so that just can't be the truth.

420
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,360
But it doesn't matter.

421
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,720
And the way it works in our system is, okay, we all voted.

422
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,960
We have a majority to do this, so let's do it and we'll support it and we'll see what

423
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
comes of it.

424
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,720
If it doesn't work out, then all right, then we'll, we'll, we'll have to

425
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,640
change it or adapt it or whatever's necessary.

426
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,920
And of course, in politics, there's no winning or losing.

427
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,640
There's only battles that continue.

428
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
And that's the way it's supposed to be.

429
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
I think it's healthy.

430
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
It really is.

431
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
And let's see what happens.

432
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
You know, maybe we're all wrong.

433
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Maybe it's great.

434
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Maybe it isn't.

435
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,240
But history will definitely show if this was good or not.

436
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,720
And we'll have an opportunity to correct this is a great country.

437
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,600
And yeah, I'm, I'm a little concerned about what it might have regarding financial implications.

438
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:25,200
But we'll see now by that same token, I feel that we should also revisit some of the things

439
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,040
we're doing as a country such as the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, which as far

440
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,360
as I know are illegal, unconstitutional, seeing as the Congress did not necessarily write

441
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,400
a war, an act of war against either of those countries, I think there's a lot of shenanigans

442
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
going on.

443
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,720
And that's something that needs to be top of the agenda right now because that also, by the

444
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,360
way, we'll save us some money.

445
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,760
That's the crazy thing that I feel is, you know, we all need universal health care, we need

446
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,960
to take care of people.

447
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,040
On the other side, we're, we're throwing hot lead at boys and girls and, you know, drone

448
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,360
shooting people from out of the sky and deserts, it's very disturbing to me, particularly

449
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,400
when you see shows like the Pacific, which again I'll get back to later on.

450
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,960
So Bruce Cockburn kind of sums it all up, how I'm feeling about what's going on, the

451
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,680
side's health care, and there's quite a lot to be worried about, a lot of things we need

452
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
to change.

453
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,480
Check out this track if I had a rocket launcher on the Charley.

454
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:50,200
Here comes the helicopter, second time today, everybody scatters, and hopes it goes away,

455
00:36:50,200 --> 00:37:05,680
how many kids they've murdered, only God can say, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had

456
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:13,880
a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, I'd make somebody

457
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:24,840
pay.

458
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't believe in guarded borders, and I don't believe in hate.

459
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,320
I don't believe in generals, or they're stinking torture states.

460
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:55,480
But when I talk with the survivors, the things do a second aim to relate, if I had

461
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:06,160
a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket

462
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:19,120
launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher,

463
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,120
if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher,

464
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:55,080
if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had

465
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:02,520
a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, I'd would not have

466
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:18,520
a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had

467
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:34,520
a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher, if I had

468
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:50,520

491
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,880
matter we've really got to be careful perhaps we need to teach our kids how to

492
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,440
read a little better now there's a book I'd like to write the book I'm

493
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,920
learning to read some John and I can work on long-term projects it's the

494
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,640
Charlie episode a 23 I don't know why it doesn't need to matter how hard

495
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,920
to try keep that in mind I'm whose eye is right to explain to do time

496
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,360
oh I know time is a valuable thing watch it plot by as the pendulum swings

497
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,440
it's locked to countdown to the end of the day the clock takes life away it's so

498
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,480
fun really didn't look at the globe watch the time you'll write out the window

499
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,800
trying to hold on didn't even know or wasted it's all just to watch you I kept everything

500
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,760
inside it didn't even know what tried you know from the party when it meant to be

501
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,440
you'll eventually be a memory of a time I tried it's so fun and that's so

502
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:45,800
fun it doesn't even matter I had to fall to live it all but in the end it doesn't

503
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:52,880
even matter one thing I don't know why it doesn't even matter how hard you try

504
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,600
keep that in mind I designed it's rhyme to remind myself how I tried it so it's

505
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,560
my way you were mocking me acting like I was part of your property

506
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,720
remembering all the times you've bought with me I'm surprised it got so

507
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,640
things aren't the way they were before you wouldn't even recognize me anymore

508
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,400
that's you knew me back then but it all comes back to me

509
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,160
you kept everything inside it didn't even know what tried you know from the

510
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,160
party when it meant to be a memory of a time I tried it's so fun and that's so

511
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:40,520
fun it doesn't even matter I had to fall to live it all but in the end it doesn't

512
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:55,480
even matter I put my trust in you your steps far as I can go for all this

513
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:06,880
there's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you

514
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:19,880
I tried so hard and that's so fun it doesn't even matter I had to fall to live

515
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:35,880
it all but in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to live it all but in the end

516
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:50,840
it doesn't even matter

517
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,840
love that song

518
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:00,440
love that band Lincoln Park in the end on daily source code episode 823 broadcasting live

519
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,000
on no agenda stream dot com which is so cool now that we have iPhones and androids

520
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,960
and even a black barrier to has some kind of app that you can listen to listen to

521
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,160
streaming media we got cars coming out with streaming media I think there's we're

522
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,160
really in the next five years we're going to see some really interesting things

523
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,760
happening with streaming audio and the connections we can make with it I

524
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,080
definitely plan on being a part of it but also I'm very interested in this you know

525
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:37,080
I was I really have to say when I got that memo that got that first iPhone and I

526
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,960
dropped it in the toilet after a week and it was completely toast and then you know

527
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,920
I tried to bring it back to life I still have it by the way it's coming in one of my

528
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,640
boxes it does still fire up it still comes alive unfortunately the touch screen

529
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,840
is completely broken so you can't do anything with it you can't even answer a phone

530
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,600
call remember I put it in the kitty litter to try and draw the the moisture out yeah

531
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,320
great experiment and of course I was really angry then because it's like you can't

532
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,640
take the battery out so I really straight away from the iPhone for a long time

533
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:14,080
I really became loyalist to Nokia the E71 in particular really did a great job

534
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,120
for me for quite a while and then the Android came out have to say I was really

535
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,160
digging the Android really like the apps the whole paradigm what I'll call an

536
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,600
app phone I don't I think something like the Nokia E71 is really more like a

537
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,200
smartphone that's a phone that has smarts in it but this new thing this thing you

538
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,360
know the it's the iPhone basically launched and I think Android is doing good

539
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:44,640
job of providing a version of it is an app phone and I love the open architecture

540
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,240
of the apps and being able to you know having a lot more control over it but

541
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,840
man I just don't think you can beat the experience of the iPhone and they're

542
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,080
and I think that Apple is surprised by the experience that they've they've

543
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,880
created it's really it's really a game changers really transform the way people

544
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,800
use mobile device I know it's done that with me I mean I even I don't own a

545
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,560
Kindle but I do find myself actually using the Kindle app for the iPhone to read

546
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,800
your book in fact I'm reading genius of the beast still almost done with that

547
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,800
from whenever I have a chance because it's such a happy positive book and I

548
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,400
can pick it up in the middle of the night if I wake up which I another thing

549
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,960
what the hell is that all about yeah I sleep like six and a half hours and I'm

550
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,240
awake and I ready to go and yeah it's like five thirty in a morning and

551
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,080
what's up I don't seem to be able to sleep longer than that anymore yeah yet I'm

552
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,120
not tired I'm on an airplane I'll just say I'm going to be a couple chapters

553
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:48,040
here it's fantastic and I'm just amazed by the yeah it's the closed business

554
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,640
model and there's lots of pros and cons about the way Apple does things but

555
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,280
I'm not adverse to it you know if you wanted to deliver a real experience to the

556
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,240
the I wouldn't say the lowest but the broadest common denominator you have to

557
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,400
take control of the the hardware the software and some of the services and I

558
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,200
think they've done an excellent job and I have been working on my own iPhone app

559
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:20,960
for coming up on let me see three months now which is interesting because I

560
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,960
really wanted to do was much of it myself as possible which meant firing up

561
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,800
X code and learning objective C which is no small feet I can tell you it was

562
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,880
easier to learn the language of the lawyers than it was to learn the objective C

563
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,880
but if I reconnected with a number of people who are doing some very interesting

564
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,520
things making it a lot easier and more affordable for people to create their

565
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,560
own iPhone apps and I think I'll be talking about that in the next week or two

566
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,680
as I get my iPhone app launched first it has to all come together I did have to

567
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:02,960
outsource some of the graphic work which I really suck at and so I found a

568
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,640
couple guys who I knew from the package it's rogue rogue sheep and they've

569
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,880
done a great job on creating even something as simple as the the apps icon you

570
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,280
know that's like you really got to think about do you want the icon to show

571
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,800
what the app does or do you want something that be just pops out and people

572
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,360
always say oh yes I remember that app I know what that does and it's something

573
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,560
that is really very visual and grabs your attention and says click on it you know

574
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,200
all these different things that have to be queried and then of course I'm

575
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,280
going to go through the whole process of understanding how Apple's approvals

576
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,360
work which will be interesting since there is some video component to this app

577
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:50,520
oh yeah I got some video projects in mind and a video component is you know

578
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,560
can really trip you up on the approval process based upon bandwidth it's being

579
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,640
used when the phone is in mobile mode so I'll keep you up to speed on everything

580
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,760
that's going on with that but first before we go any further say hello to my old

581
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,400
little friend

582
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:16,760

584
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:33,720
to my own return I am I intend to contribute back your DSC the reason I

585
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,480
haven't been going to be no agenda is because a we don't play any comments and

586
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,400
no agenda that's why guys don't play and the top we talk about I know a very

587
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,920
little or nothing about I love it when I can't understand what you're talking

588
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,800
about pp

589
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,160

590
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,720
there's a friend of mine I'll call him for now

591
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,480
pakey bond because that's because of the office in London you have no

592
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,160
mistakes I think you know he is yeah he's been saying to mention the

593
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,880
information about his work at Goldman Sachs and I know you guys are all

594
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,040
working over there and that realm of the universe and I love the fact that you

595
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,760
talking to me give me as much insight information at least your thought

596
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,920
process is good stuff

597
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,880
regard the stuff you've been talking to agenda regarding Goldman Sachs

598
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,240
and rest of it he will he will hopefully also be contributing stuff

599
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,400
regularly probably by email because he doesn't really write it like his voice

600
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:41,600
pretty cool you know he'll be telling me what he has to say and I just want to

619
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:25,680
yeah I love the lyric I turn on my MTV but it doesn't see me yeah that's exactly the

620
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,560
problem isn't it oh man remember to self got to do a show about the

621
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:36,480
mind control of the music industry so much we've got to talk about a lot of

622
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,080
catching up to do and a couple of comments came in let me just roll this

623
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,760
one out for you hi Adam welcome back with a DSC it's great to have it back

624
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,600
after all this time of course it's so slow that it was just last week that I

625
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,000
published a podcast all about the history of RSS and I say in the roundup by the end of

626
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,520
that that the final daily source code happened in February 2009 and then of course a few

627
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,800
days later wouldn't you know it but another DSC appears or should that be SC anyway

628
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,520
SC DSC whatever it's good to have you back doing the more personal source code of your

629
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,040
lifetime podcast that's the stuff I think really works not so much the conspiracy theory

630
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:19,520
stuff it's the from the heart stuff that really connects so keep it up just don't let it take

631
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,520
you over and if you want to hear what I said about you and they whiner and

632
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,120
closures and podcasting have a listen to show 33 of the IT author podcast from about

633
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,240
407 30 onwards all the best bye all right man thank you so much for saying that in

634
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,400
and thanks for the show by the way and I recommend people listen to the whole show don't

635
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,600
just shuttle ahead 41 minutes hey no no no no it's actually worth it to listen to a couple

636
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,760
shows in their entirety don't you think Chris Moiles from BBC Radio 1 was talking about

637
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,200
at the other day we've come a long way with podcasting when this is what he asked to say

638
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,360
he came back with this for the knowledge that some of our listeners don't know what podcasts

639
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:11,440
I think most don't they don't know what a podcast is right yeah now maybe he was meeting some

640
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:19,040
stupid people I thought most people knew what a podcast was so alad is written a

641
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,160
layman's cell you have the best of the miles podcast so he's written a script

642
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,480
and I went well podcasts instead of like you know being on the radio like a broadcast

643
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,920
it's a podcast it's on your iPod but I guess you know necessarily on your iPod that's why

644
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,680
they're called it no it is in the arm because they're also in the internet

645
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,200
while they were called neck cast from like no I don't think the iPod has anything to do with

646
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,960
podcasts or things coincidence you must do surely I think it's coincidence

647
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,440
well I mean I'm not a scientist but I thought that was the connection

648
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:04,800
I thought because we talked about this guy in the air before Adam Curry who is known as the

649
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:11,680
podfar worked at Apple if he did that she went to MTV if he did that's why I don't think it is

650
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:19,280
I think it's just coincidence the sound similar and he's very techy and he is pretty much credited

651
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:27,280
with making the first of a podcast there you go I've just proved my place

652
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:36,320
oh go I'm right yeah so I win now moving on Alex if you were to explain to one of our

653
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:43,760
list by the way can you just text in if you don't know what a podcast stop stop stop stop there you go

654
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,960
that's worse than what Wikipedia has to say

655
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,200
now I think it's all gonna melt together though that's pretty good people you know they got like

656
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,480
I got my I got this show on my iPhone on my iPod and yeah it's gonna be streaming in my car radio

657
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:06,800
people oh yeah it's gotta be it's becoming ubiquitous which I like I really like a lot of these

658
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,760
iPhone apps and Android apps that's stream a show or that give you and we finally got the bandwidth

659
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,120
I mean I just want to say one thing about podcasting it's original intent and when Dave wine

660
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:26,320
and I worked on the enclosure element for RSS it was original intent was to have your computer

661
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:32,320
doing something in his downtime and sucking in content that you would know about but your computer

662
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,680
would say oh I have something new for you and basically time delaying everything and now things

663
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,280
are so snappy in general even though we have pretty much the worst broadband infrastructure in the

664
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,040
world or 15th on the list or whatever in the US in general you could pretty much get on demand

665
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,880
now and uh case and point you can also do things live this streaming works pretty well

666
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,840
and uh above all you can still just put out whatever you want to put out

667
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,680
then if you've got a show that you want to promote on the source code I'd love to let people know about it

668
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,040
people in just three don't discuss it just yellow or each other I wish I could say what I really

669
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,840
think and have people actually listening is there any place where people discuss the hot button

670
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:27,200
subjects of the day without disrespect yes there is it is called plain dudes radio what is

671
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:33,840

680
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,200
days of podcasting there is a group of girls who I must give major props to because they really

681
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,520
help me understand and they were the first ones I think I really work with in a pod safe environment
