1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All right, everybody, as usual before a big event, the first thing we do is...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
...all rise.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Please, gentlemen, please rise for your contamination.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The National Anthem, and you may sing along.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the morning, get ammunition.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are all charged up to be.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Human resources and servants in all lands and oceans,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
...from the east to west,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
...our number two,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
...the lowlands and beyond.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We are happy and distracted slaves

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
...if our Japanese are...

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
...in the morning.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 854,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
...the football Friday,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
...and this is I Am Your Slave Edition.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We've systemmed these assessments

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
...in showing five lines of time.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The 21st century of radio starts here.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We need to be nearby.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I know it's in the three lines of honesty.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's better to create.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Everybody today, I am your slave.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Brand new spirit of radio coming here

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
...from the hills of Watchtower, Cray Park, Command Center.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We'll move to my little friend.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All right, here we go.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm giving source code.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's quitting time, everybody.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Crack it up.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a full railway, it's crackle with light, right in the sand, up there so that the energy

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Emotions will be stuck in time, it's way late, that we can't feed our faces all night

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All this machine, remaking my music, you still be a fan of it

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Not one phone in charge of it, it's really just the question of your honesty, yeah, your honesty

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
One night's gonna be leaving the freedom of music

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A literary crisis and then he is compromises, shatter the illusion of integrity

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's not opinion, that's science

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And science is one call of a bitch with a 14-inch strap on

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Dying against the risk of the energy

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Emotions will be stuck in time, it's way late, that we can't feed our faces all night

76

Emotions will be stuck in time, it's way late, that we can't feed our faces all night

But who's fire

There must have got the message that

Before it leaves him Fox

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
To make $600 million

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
By doing this online here we are

Having a really good time

126
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,720
You see, I know you're not real man, because I'm loaded okay, I've had some experience

You see, I know you're not real man, because I know you're not real man, because I know you're not real,

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
because I know you're not real man, because I know you know you're not real man, because I know you're not real man

133
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:50,060
Say I'm the black little baby, I'm the streets of Berlin

134
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:56,060
You won't be the mission, she ain't all the same

135
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,060
We're in control now

136
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,060
She doesn't need a lot of rules

137
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,060
I'm getting a lot of questions

138
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,060
I never think that they do

139
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,060
But where else will I be?

140
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Sex

141
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I'll be the hell

142
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,060
I'll be the hell

143
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:37,060
So after two, number 13

144
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Love is just where it'd be, yeah

145
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm the hands who will suffer

146
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,060
To rip it off your skin

147
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,060
Break up the leaves

148
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,060
She's blowing an octave

149
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,060
Surgeoned in every way

150
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,060
I feel like I'm in a breath

151
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,060
But I won't be the reason

152
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Sex

153
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,060

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Sex

163
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
We're in control now

164
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
She's blowing an octave

165
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,060
She's blowing an octave

166
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,060
I'll be the hell

167
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,060
So after two, number 13

168
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,060
How did it happen?

169
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,060
How did it happen?

170
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,060

174
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,060
And lo and behold, fuck you guys came through

175
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060

Even in the chat room in the origin of chat.net

178
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,060
That should be some value for your money right there

179
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
No one said it

180
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,060
I am so pumped up

181
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060

182
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,060
Better wear shoes

Things I go in grades

188
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
And they're only getting better

189
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,060

190
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060

Get it out of here

197
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
I've got a lot of fear

198
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060

200
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,060

Perfect

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
I don't want to lose

I've got pretty beauty

262
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
There's time for classes

263
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
And things that will be great

264
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
There's a whole different meta

265
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Time to raise the ending

266
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,400
It's just a little bit.

267
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,720
You and I are ready.

268
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,800
Getting good grades, the future's so bright.

269
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Oh, I got it with your shades.

270
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,280
Bobby, even in the chat room, I'm gonna ask for an hour, I got it.

271
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,440
Bobby, take your panties off, ladies, everyone wants to say.

272
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,400
We know that you've got a special Dropbox for the Charlie,

273
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,800
so we love you to help us out there.

274
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,960
I will be talking a lot about the brand new model

275
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,800
for the daily source code later on today,

276
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,120
but first, not just shades, because the future's so bright,

277
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,360
I think we need some ear muscles,

278
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,640
because your ears are gonna bleed.

279
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,240
They go to the Tells, but look forgot.

280
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,920
Let's go, let's go, an.

281
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh no, I'm going to,

283
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,560
I want to get your out.

284
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah?

285
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
I feel pretty good.

286
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,920
And I get, that I feel good,

287
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,960
praises I blade,

288
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,920
Oh, we all got it through no black things,

289
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I know I'm falling so hard

290
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,920
When it comes to the girls, it's better

291
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,920
But don't worry about it, it's better

292
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
It's better, it's better, it's better

293
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,920
And let's dig out the chair

294
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Let's dig out the chair

Let's dig out the chair

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
And let's dig out the chair

299
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
This lazy lady and the second baby

300
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Liar goes over the pool

301
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
So the same way

302
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
I've thought this as a suit

303
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I know I'm fallen out on my way

304
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920

I'm cornered in all your dead

308
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,740
I know that there's no reason

309
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,840
In you side, I'm in fire

310
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,040

This is my decision.

349
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm coming home to stay this time

350
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,960
because I'm in full Barcelona.

351
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm in full Barcelona.

352
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,840
Full Barcelona.

353
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,680
I'm in full Barcelona.

354
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,720
Oh, oh, oh!

355
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,520
Freedom of the cleanest, sitting in the sun.

356
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,960
But I can't my dream back.

357
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,080
I can't open my eyes.

358
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,840
I'm in full Barcelona.

359
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Everything is in here I've got

360
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,840
It's out of full force in it

361
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm a full force in it

362
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,840
I'm a full force in it

363
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I'm a full force in it

364
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
It's a fish out of water

365
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
I'm just a man in the hole

366
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,840
The city lies to the police

367
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
I don't want to go

368
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,840
I'm just a person waiting

369
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm gonna hit the bridge

370
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Just a friend to sleep

371
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I'm tired of laying by

372
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Hang it around

373
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm gonna catch a train

374
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,840
I'll be a sea-bound

375
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm just a person waiting

376
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,840
I'm gonna catch a train

377
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm gonna catch a train

378
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm just a person waiting

379
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm just a person waiting

380
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm just a person looking

381
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I'm just a homestay man

382
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,840
I've got to hit me, I'm just a homestay man

383
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I've got to hit a homestay man

384
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Stay fit to the crowd

385
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Which I've got to not be in

386
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm that much happy's good and laugh

387
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
When I see my inner city, it's time

388
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,840
I'll be walking on a crowd

389
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
There's no fool, I'll sit there

390
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

391
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

392
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

393
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

394
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

395
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

396
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

397
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

398
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

399
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
I'll be fool, I'll sit there

400
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:26,880
I know I made it look like I said it all up there Bob, you even join us in the chat room

401
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,920
and know it's in the chat.net, but I just can't take any credit.

402
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,280
This is what happens when magic takes place my friends and magic it is.

403
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Bob had a full for the City of the Avisors Code episode 8, 54, a brand new model for the show.

404
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,280
So here's the story briefly.

405
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:59,280
I've been following this Kickstarter.com website for a while ever since the diaspora project

406
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,280
raised a shitload of money for them to go off and start that project which is actually running

407
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,640
now and I'm keeping my eye on that and I said to myself, you know what, maybe this is a model

408
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,120
that we can put into place for all the chuckle heads to come together and add some value

409
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,400
for value on both sides of the equation and I set up a project which was very an interesting

410
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,520
process where you basically write you description and you submit it and then it took

411
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,960
them like two weeks to get back to me even though I'd said I want to do this last week,

412
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
last Friday for the show.

413
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,680
I said, oh, I'm really sorry I really backed up and so they basically they do go through

414
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,680
some kind of screening process although I think they have basically freelancers who are,

415
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,400
you know, just looking to see if it's something that can make them money because they do

416
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:49,680
make money off of the whole idea through the payment processing which goes through Amazon.

417
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,240
But what I love about this is you set your goal and you set your minimums and you set

418
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,920
your prizes and your little incentives and no one gets charged unless the money is raised

419
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,360
so the way we did is minimum of five dollars to donate to the show which has now been collected

420
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
from everyone.

421
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Thank you so much.

422
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,400
I think it'll take 14 days before it actually comes to me so we'll see how much is left

423
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,600
over at that point.

424
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,040
$50 would get you a Skype call and we have a couple of those coming up during today's

425
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,880
extravaganza and a hundred dollars or more would it be an executive producer credits.

426
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
So let me mention them again.

427
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:34,480
Dave Hoffman for $120 and $0.45 cent 1,2345 of one of my favorite numerology additions.

428
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,680
There crazy hurts $100 at him.

429
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Burke pile.

430
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,800

431
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,880
$50 from Sir Kelly Spongberg, $50, actually double nipples on the dime, $55 and

432
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
10 cents and then there's a list of other donors.

433
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,800
I want to mention everyone your donation.com,

434
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,920

But I can't find you

451
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Such into the day, into the night

452
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
They wouldn't stop for the London

453
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,800
They didn't know when they didn't understand

454
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
And we were asking why

455
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Yeah, I'm our way, yeah

456
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
They wouldn't shout

457
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
And I'm blind in my mind

458
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
All that you see wasn't on and down the stream

459
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
All the shadows in into the night

460
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,800

They did't take on you

513
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Your C please

514
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,120
Just the score

515
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,840
I just got the score

516
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I'm getting worried, got the idea from in the first place, but I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen.

517
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,840
I would be highly surprised if it did.

518
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Since Apple is so hell bent on protecting us real slaves from bad words.

519
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Oh no, not bad words.

520
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,840
You know, the stuff we use here at the kind of stuff that Bobby Eden talks about in the chat room.

521
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,840
You know, I'll be no good.

522
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,840
No, my friends, I think we're on something big here, and I'm very, very proud of what the chuckle had to do.

523
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
As we all came together, of course.

524
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,840
I don't know if we're going to do this every single week.

525
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I feel like I could give you a couple of freebies.

526
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,840
I don't think we can necessarily have to raise money for every single Charlie,

527
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
but I really do like the fact that it worked.

528
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I just take a leap into shore.

529
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
Now, of course, not everyone is able to contribute monetarily.

530
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,840
And I think we had about 42 or 43 backers of the project.

531
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Lots of other people have been supporting this show.

532
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,840
We've got chuckle heads worldwide who have put together by dropping a song to your drop-box sharing that with me.

533
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,840
And we've got people who do actual work for the program like our buddy Ray.

534
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
All we want is not just Ray.

535
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Hey, chuckle head.

536
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Hey, you're complaining to me.

537
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Oh, we've got to be a part of us against a game.

538
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Ray, what's our goal?

539
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
This is me.

540
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
A very special hit list.

541
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
And this he let us out of Ray on the Charlie.

542
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Checkpoint.

543
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,840
The monthly Dutch magazine for Veterans of War is publishing

544
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,840
in December edition with Veterans of 15.

545
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,840
The magazine asked 75,000 veterans of war

546
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,840
to send in a top three most clay songs during a mission.

547
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,840
And it made the top 50.

548
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,840
From young 12 World War II veterans to those who were sent to Afghanistan,

549
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,840
they all send in the three most favorite songs.

550
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,840
So let's check out the top three of this Veterans of 15.

551
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Number three in this very special hit list.

552
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,840
A song from 1984 played by a Dutch orchestra.

553
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,840
This is I want to go home.

554
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
It will be nice.

555
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,840
It will be nice.

556
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,840
It will be nice.

557
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
God willing to be God willing to be God willing to be God willing to be God.

558
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Music from other lands, my friends.

559
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,840
And back the years to train to the earth.

560
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Number three in this top 50, I want to go home.

561
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Played by this Dutch orchestra.

562
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
And then let's take a look at number two.

563
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,840
All their veterans chosen especially for the numbers of the British singer Vera Laine.

564
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,840
We'll meet again in at on the 22nd spot.

565
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
For a song from the time you say goodbye,

566
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,840
finished in second place on the Veterans' top 50.

567
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:28,840
From the time you say goodbye.

568
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,840
From the time you say,

569
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, cheerio.

570
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Music, where do you take our handshake true?

571
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Oh my God, I love this right.

572
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:56,840
For your journey as you go.

573
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Keep a prayer within your heart.

574
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:14,840
That's the time we'll surely fly.

575
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:32,840
To the day when we shall meet again from the time you say goodbye.

576
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:43,840
And now ladies and gentlemen, this is number one.

577
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,840
This song with the appropriate title, we gotta get out of this place.

578
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:55,840
The British pop group, the animals, is the most popular song among ducks' groups during their mission.

579
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
In this studio part of the city.

580
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,840
When the sun revives to ashes.

581
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
People tell me they're here.

582
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,840
No, we're just in front.

583
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty.

584
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,840
And one thing I love is true.

585
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Give me a dead loop.

586
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Oh, you try to miss you.

587
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I love you.

588
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Watch my lady face.

589
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Watch his hand and turn her face.

590
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

591
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Oh yes, I love her.

592
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:49,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

593
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:57,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

594
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

595
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

596
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

597
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

598
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,840
He's been working in slain in his life.

599
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Now my girl, you're so young and pretty.

600
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,840
And one thing I love is true.

601
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Give you a dead loop.

602
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Oh you try and miss you.

603
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,840
What's my daddy in bed at the time?

604
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Watch his hand, better turn it crazy

605
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,840
But we're gonna sleep in that place

606
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,840
I know we've been a firm and so hot

607
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,840
But I'll be with you

608
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

609
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

610
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,840
We gotta get out of this place

611
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

612
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,840
We gotta get out of this place

613
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,840
We're all in a better life for me and you

614
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Somewhere, baby

615
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,840
Somehow, no, baby

616
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,840
We gotta get out of this place

617
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

618
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,840
We gotta get out of this place

619
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,840
We're all in a better life for me and you

620
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Leave me, baby

621
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
I know it, baby.

622
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
You know it too.

623
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:02,400
I know it's not very original, but hey, the song by the animals from 1965 came with a large

624
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,640
maturity on number one. It is especially popular among young veterans. Many of them play

625
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,400
this song every day, a singing out loud during a mission. We got to get out of this place

626
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,400
because it was a song for American soldiers during the Vietnam War.

627
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,520
So I'll make it in checkpoint. It made this top 50 to celebrate the 100th edition of the

628
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,200
magazine Next Week. And I wish you all a very nice weekend. Bye bye now.

629
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,040
I'm going to run a rain, I'm flying just in the club. I'm crossing, I'm ready. I'm trying not to

630
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,400
think I'm winning the last one, but we're ready again. Oh, oh, oh, we had it. Right, did it really turn

631
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,640
at night? Oh, brother, it's cool. We've had it, but not by the moon. Oh, oh, oh, we had it. But at the time

632
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,840
it seems a bad toy. It's a surprise to my children for fun. There it is.

633
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,880
My husband's had it, and I'm today with all the kids. I've gone away, gone to my next school.

634
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,240
Every time that he's done well, he's alone and Vince is kind.

635
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
So I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

636
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

637
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

638
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

639
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

640
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

641
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

642
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

643
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

644
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

645
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

646
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

647
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

648
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

649
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

650
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.

651
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm ready.

652
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready. I'm ready.

653
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

654
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

655
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

656
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

657
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

658
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

659
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

660
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

661
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

662
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

667
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,640
I'm ready.

668
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm going to run a rainy life.

669
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

670
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

671
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240

I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

675
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

676
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
OK.

677
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
I'm going to run a rain, I'm ready.

678
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm ready.

679
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
I'm ready.

680
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,760
This is gonna be laughing at me right now,

681
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,560
she heard me talking about how scar I was.

682
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,400
All right, and now for the fun stuff,

683
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,640
let's get back to reality.

684
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,040
Frustration and discord,

685
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,520
affirming in every city.

686
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,400
And if I read out what the digital fees

687
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,160
I'd love a little bit of the century.

688
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,800
And the balance of Rachel,

689
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,480
my little ring, everything I see

690
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,240
that will set it free.

691
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Oh, make them turn the time she left her.

692
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,000
All right, we're new,

693
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,160
I like democracy,

694
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,800
so I share everything that comes to me.

695
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,280
I can't let it to the handrail,

696
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,560
I can't let it to the floor,

697
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,840
I can't let it to the middle,

698
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,280
you better protect you,

699
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,120
all that you claim belongs to us.

700
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,360
You cannot do what you cannot touch.

701
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,720
All that you face just never really yours.

702
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,560
All that claim belongs to us.

703
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:23,720
We were so we were so close of faith,

704
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:30,120
but we were like you can follow the rules.

705
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,720
All right, we're new,

706
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,240
we're new,

707
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,880
we're new now,

708
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,700
we're new now,

709
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,320
we do things with those rules you not

710
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:57,320
And maybe we won't, all that you claim belongs to us

711
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,320
You cannot tell what you cannot touch

712
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:11,320
All that you think just will never relay yours

713
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,320
All that you claim belongs to us

714
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,320
They stick to a post and expand in the empire of oppression

715
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
And with the tiny group of real self-employed rulers

716
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,320
Control every aspect of every life

717
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
Every aspect of every life

718
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,320
All that you claim belongs to us

719
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,320
You cannot tell what you cannot touch

720
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:51,320
All that you think just will never relay yours

721
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,320
All that you think just will never relay yours

722
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,320
All that you think just will never relay yours

723
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,320
All that you claim belongs to us

724
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,320
All that you think just will never relay yours

725
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,320
You cannot tell what you think just will never relay yours

726
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
That's what I'm talking about

727
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,320
I'm talking about you

728
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
We know it might be hard

729
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,320
We never explained it

730
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,320
It's shit you've never heard before

731
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Just noticing my draw box and shows up

732
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Share with the pirate anthem under the daily source code episode eight five four

733
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,320
And of course, we always are looking out to try and find songs that

734
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Well, you may not have heard before

735
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,320
And this may be a version you've not heard before

736
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
It's live

737
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Five is Jim Carr and Simple Mines.

738
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,320
You're amazing along the course.

739
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Just wait until the drum hits.

740
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
Here we go.

741
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

742
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
I hope you can see your bad.

743
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,320
I hope you'll know that soon.

744
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,320
You know the best.

745
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:59,320
So can you tell us about given me everything inside now?

746
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:07,220
Love's strange, it's so weird, I don't think of the ten of things that we won't be able to know

747
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,320
I'm so sure, you must be cool as a part

748
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:17,820
When the clouds disappear, you'll find me, don't you?

749
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:25,820
I don't need a family, I don't go home, don't you?

750
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:36,440
I don't need a family, yeah, I don't have it, yeah

751
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,920
Come on

752
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,880
No, just try and pretend

753
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,480
It's my feeling of laughing

754
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,600
Yeah, hang on

755
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,020
I'll touch you

756
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,340
Open your eyes

757
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,620
Close your eyes

758
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,320
sogenan如何

759
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,920
You stop

760
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,000
Don't shoot

761
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,760
Forget about me, I'll be alone

762
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,080
I'll be dancing, don't make me go too

763
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,080
Take us apart, and go to space

764
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,720
You love me, love me

765
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,520
Don't you, forget about me

766
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,960
I don't, don't, don't, don't

767
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,000
Don't you, forget about me

768
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,640
You just stand above me

769
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,760
You're my way, I never love you

770
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,280
One, two, three, four

771
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,880
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad

772
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,320
You recognize me, from my baby

773
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,040
One, one, five

774
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,880
Rink his phone, Rink his phone

775
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,640
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad

776
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,080
Dad, Dad, Dad

777
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:19,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

778
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:30,280
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

779
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,840
Don't you, forget about me

780
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,680
I don't, don't you

781
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Don't you know that I'm dead about me

782
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
I still want all my life

783
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,680
So I'm all alone with you

784
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:10,680
Don't you know that I'm all alone with you

785
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,680
I'm all alone with you

786
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,680
Tell me about the sexuality it's in your DNA

787
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,680
Jogs, jogs, jogs, and jogs

788
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,680

Let's vote for Jogs

794
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:44,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

796
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,740
Checking out the chat room that's where Bobby Eden is hanging out today.

797
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,620
I think she's doing her live webcam show at the same time, and she puts in a request.

798
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,800
Well, of course, all of the snails jump on that one.

799
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Yeah!

800
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,460
Bobby, I think you should open up at least five, three minutes for everybody, right now.

801
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,460
By request, stop the odds!

802
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,000
Ah, okay.

803
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,900
It's all in one.

804
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,660
You fool yourself.

805
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,700
It's very life secret.

806
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,100
We're in long time, okay?

807
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,480
It's all-right.

808
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,360
Richard was Earth.

809
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,260
For one is ruined.

810
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,180
And you gotta sing.

811
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,900
The masked man is hungry, she needs to tell home.

812
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,400
The river inches and feet are well

813
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,400
What this is your new place has to go

814
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,900
I've got to leave it, I'm on a job

815
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Here I am

816
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,900

Dropped you like a hurricane

819
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,400
The bloody spring starts to shout

820
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,400
These ideas come me, breaks down the light

821
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Thus easy for you to stop with lose

822
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Just have to make it, we still are done

823
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,400
And I am calling, I have to go

824

And go be sorry, you lies in your eyes

825

Your slink is little season, and it's your win

826
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,400
On the hot season nightfall, bloody busy

827
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Here I am

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Your slink is little season, and it's your win

848
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,400
On the hot season nightfall, bloody busy

849
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,400
Here I am

850
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Dropped you like a hurricane

851
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,400
Here I am

852
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Dropped you like a hurricane

853
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
Here I am

854
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,400
Dropped you like a hurricane

855
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,400
All right, seems like Bobby has some air

856
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
Ultimate lyrics though

857
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Dropped

858
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,400
Although maybe it's exactly what close

859
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Mine I had in mind when he wrote the lyrics

860
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,400
To rock you like your hurricane

861
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
The scorpions of the daily source code episode

862
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Eight-five-four, the food bar Friday

863
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Making your ears bleed all around

864
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Get monation my friend

865
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,400
Like a home on a sun that's invisible there

866
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain in the fear

867
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Until we get it, we'll get it, let it all disappear

868
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,400
Waiting for the end to come

869
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,400
Wishing I has dreams to stand

870
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,400
This is not what I happened

871
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,400
It's out of my control

872
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Fly what the speed of life

873
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Thoughts were spinning in my head

874
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,400
So many things were left, I said

875
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,400
It's hard to let you go

876
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,400
When I want to take the move on

877
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,400
When I want to feel the light

878
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,400
When I want to do a straight this light

879
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
To something new

880
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,400
Holding on to what I have it

881
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,400
Go

882
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:33,400
Sting in and down to trying to forget the past

883
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:39,400
When this was never meant to last

884
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:46,400
I wish it wasn't so

885
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,400
When I want to take the move on

886
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,400
When I want to feel the light

887
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,400
When I want to do a straight this light

888
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,400
To something new

889
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Holding on to what I have it

890
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
Go

891
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,400
Yeah, what was that?

892
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,400
When I find a what is gone

893
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
I thought it felt right

894
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,400
But everything was wrong

895
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
I've caught up in the highest storm

896
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Trying to figure out what is life will be

897
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,400
And I don't need to know what kind of things I said

898
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,400
I'm out getting moving in my mind with this

899
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Thinking of the pieces now where to begin

900
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,400
I just put a hand in this morning again

901
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:47,400
When I want to do a straight this light

902
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
To something new

903
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Holding on to what I have it

904
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,400
Go

905
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Sting in and down to trying to forget the past

906
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,400
When I want to do a straight this light

907
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
To something new

908
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Holding on to what I have it

909
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Oh my god

910
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
That's who I am

911
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
I wonder if only 10 in the dark

912
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:19,400
That's who I can't even

913
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Of where I'll just go home

914
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
And try to break

915
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
And go morning

916
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:44,820
1, 2, 3, help!

917
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:50,960
My telegrammit!

918
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:39,900
To death lost their kids.

919
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:46,900
Talk down those fingers!

920
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:55,900
Oh yeah!

921
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:08,900
Get your body down, get your feet down, get your feet down, get your feet down, get your feet down.

922
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
Lead the layman!

923
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,900
Got the down there right, got my heart down tight.

924
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,900
Gotta be right on the ceiling.

925
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,900
My heart's in the darkness, now I'm sick of it.

926
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,900
I love the sound.

927
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,900
Don't worry, I won't let you on this time.

928
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:33,900
Bye!

929
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,900
Time to

930
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,900
Now I am on the钩.

931
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,900
Now come early!

932
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,900
I'm on the钩, now I'm on the ceiling.

933
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:55,900
Oh Oh No!

934
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,900
Let's go, I will get to you

935
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,900
For all you'll be every time

936
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,900
You'll make a goal in life

937
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,900
I've heard of you, and I'll see the world

938
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
We'll go for great

939
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,900
No, God, I've given the name

940
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,900
You'll make a moment

941
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,900
You'll see how it is

942
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,900
You'll make a goal in life

943
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,900
You'll make a goal in life

944
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,900
You'll make a goal in life

945
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,900
You'll make a goal in life

946
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,900
You'll make a goal in life

947
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,900
You'll make a goal in life

01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,900
You'll make a goal in life

You'll make a goal in life

01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,900
You'll make a goal in life

954
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,900
You'll make a goal in life

955
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,900
You'll make a goal in life

956
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,900
You'll make a goal in life

957
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,900
You'll make a goal in life

958
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,900
You'll make a goal in life

959
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
You'll make a goal in life

960
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,900
You'll make a goal in life

961
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,900
You'll make a goal in life

962
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,900
You'll make a goal in life

963
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,900
You'll make a goal in life

964
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,900
You'll make a goal in life

965
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:38,180
Directed by created by some military

966
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:43,180
I'm gonna go to the night

967
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:48,180
I'm gonna go to the night

968
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,180
I'm gonna go to the night

969
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,180
I'm gonna go to the night

970
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,180
I'm gonna go to the night

971
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,180
I'm gonna go to the night

972
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,180
I'm gonna go to the night

973
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,180
I'm gonna go to the night

974
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,180
I'm gonna go to the night

975
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,180
I'm gonna go to the night

976
01:05:35,180 --> 01:06:05,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

977
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:20,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, let's be alive by ourselves.

978
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:34,440
Yeah, oh, what a gem showed up in the Dropbox.

979
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,440
That is the fruit fighters, the tie and mother-down classic queen, of course.

980
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,440
There you go.

981
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,440
Live at Hyde Park for those of you who are wondering.

982
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,440
Another song you'll never, ever hear on the radio.

983
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,440
And since we have all kinds of different categories of songs here on the dating source code,

984
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,440
we've got our cowbell songs, we've got our ear bleeding songs.

985
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,440
I think it's time to introduce a new category.

986
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,440
Let's do a round of fuck you. What do you think, huh?

987
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
I think it's a perfect test.

988
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,440
And I've got a bunch of shoes and a five with magic.

989
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,440
I still don't be wager.

990
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,440
But I know I've got to take it.

991
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,440
I think that's the machine.

992
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,440
And all of that's crazy, my shoes.

993
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,440
I still wish you would bet with a fuck you.

994
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,440
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

995
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,440
I can't afford to provide it.

996
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,440
But in fact, don't think it's fair.

997
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,440
I guess you use a catchbox.

998
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,440
And I'm more on a target.

999
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,440
I've got a way you play a game and fair.

1000
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,440
I get to the pool.

1001
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
I fall in love with you.

1002
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,440
Oh, she's a girl.

1003
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,440
Well, I've got some rules for you.

1004
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Yeah, go to the hotel. You're a little boy.

1005
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,440
Oh, he's here.

1006
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1007
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1008
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,440
I just wanted my birthday.

1009
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,440
I was a senior.

1010
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1011
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1012
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1013
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,440
I still don't be wager.

1014
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,440
But I've got to take it.

1015
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,440
And all of that's crazy, my shoes.

1016
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,440
I still wish you would bet with a fuck you.

1017
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,440
No, I know.

1018
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,440
I can't borrow.

1019
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,440
I can still relax.

1020
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,440
Yeah.

1021
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Trying to keep ya.

1022
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,440
Trying to keep ya.

1023
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,440
I'm just being alone with you.

1024
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,440
As I keep, nah.

1025
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,440
I get to the pool.

1026
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,440
I fall in love with you.

1027
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,440

Oh, I really hate your way as well now.

1030
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,440
She's a girl, a girl, a girl, a girl.

1031
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1032
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,440
I just wanted my birthday.

1033
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,440
I was a senior.

1034
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1035
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1036
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
I got a bunch of girls.

1037
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,440
I still don't be wager.

1038
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,440
I'm not way back to you.

1039
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,440
And all of that's crazy, my shoes.

1040
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,440

1043
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Why?

1044
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,440
Why?

1045
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Why?

1046
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Why?

1047
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,440
Why?

1048
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,440
I tried to tell you about my love,

1049
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,440
but she told me this is what I had there.

1050
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,440
Yeah, she did.

1051
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,440
Is it what I love?

1052
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,440
Why?

1053
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,440
Why?

1054
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,440
Why?

1055
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,440
Why?

1056
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Why?

1057
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
Why?

1058
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,440

1059
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,440

1063
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:27,440
I still love you.

1064
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:37,440
Yes, I'm like in this category.

1065
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
And the theory.

1066
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,440
Fuck all of you, we're here to rock.

1067
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:52,440
And now we're here to rock.

1068
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,440
And jump all the ways have to fuck her hard.

1069
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,440
In fact, sometimes that's not right.

1070
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,440
To do.

1071
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,440
Sometimes you've got to make some love.

1072
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,440
If I can give her some smooches too.

1073
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,440
Sometimes you've got to squeeze.

1074
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,440
Sometimes you've got to save me.

1075
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,440
Sometimes you've got to save.

1076
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,440
I'm gonna fuck you.

1077
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,440
Softly.

1078
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,440
I'm gonna screw you gently.

1079
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,440
I'm gonna call you.

1080
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,440

Discreetly.

1083
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,440
And then you say, hey, I brought you flowers.

1084
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,440
And then you say, wait a minute, Sally.

1085
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,440
I think I got something in my team.

1086
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,440
Did you get it?

1087
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,440

01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,440
That's fucking teamwork.

1089
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,440
What's your favorite position?

1090
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,440
That's cool with me.

1091
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,440
It's not my favorite, but I'll do it for you.

1092
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,440
What's your favorite dish?

1093
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,440
I'm not gonna cook it, but I'll order it from Zanzibar.

So break over here, I'm cause it's heavy in the middle

Well, good to funny if you get money, good to bother.

1198
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:14,140
another non-stop track, but reminded me of a good story, I got to share the story.

1199
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:18,140
What are we going to do with it, baby?

1200
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:24,940
I remember Carol, lovely Carol, who used to drive the bedcar limousine in New York City.

1201
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:30,140
This is 1989, and she was telling me a story about her.

1202
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:32,140
And maybe it was in the early 90s.

1203
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:36,140
When Mariah Carey was, she broke up with Tommy Matola.

1204
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,140
Good move, by the way.

1205
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:42,140
The slave driver, Tommy Matola, she was married to him.

1206
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:44,140
And she kind of went nuts for a year or two there.

1207
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,140
Maybe even three years.

1208
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:50,140
But she was hanging out with heavy D in the boys in the bedcar.

1209
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:54,140
Now the bedcar was a Lincoln limousine, Lincoln towncar stretch limousine.

1210
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:58,140
And the back seat could literally fold down into a bed.

1211
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,140
And Carol would drive this car in a new car, very well.

1212
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,140
She was really sweet.

1213
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,140
But she told me all the inside dirt.

1214
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:09,140
And literally, she told me about the time she took Mariah Carey with heavy D in the boys.

1215
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,140
I think it was the metal lance of some concert.

1216
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:17,140
And she wasn't quite sure whether it was Mariah or whether it was heavy D.

1217
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:23,140
But she thinks it was Mariah who actually pooped in the back of the bedcar limousine.

1218
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,140
That boy's slim is fucking in heaven.

1219
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,140

Come to my mansion, get your watch, we sneak it at the dark.

01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,880
I'll take you higher, higher, I take you lower.

1341
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,880
Slower, I make you talk that talk and walk that long.

1342
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,880
I'll fuck you by bitch, I'll fuck you by bitch, I'll fuck you by bitch.

1343

01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,880
I' cook you by bitch, I'll fuck you by bitch, I'll fuck you by bitch.

1348
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:25,880
I could ride to just can't see no more

1349
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:45,880
I'm super fried bitch, I'm not that guy bitch

1350
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,880

1351
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,880
Thought you'd give rich thing, fucking with the player

1352
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,880

1357
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,880

01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:21,880
I'll throw them young stars, fucking with the version of mine

1359
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,880
I give a fuck about your papa or your mother, my walk up on your ass

1360
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,880

1369
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,880
I'll fucking ride to just can't see no more

1370
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:41,880
I want the fans to be a matchin'

1371
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:45,880
I want the fans to just kiss

1372
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,880
I want the fans to be a matchin'

1373
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:53,880
I want the fans to talk to me

1374
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,880
Hey stop swapping pictures of Bobby even in the chat room y'all

1375
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,880
I want the fans to kiss

1376
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,880
I'll fuck you blind bitch

1377
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:07,920
That's uh, oh, there you go. It's from that new category. We've kind of just discovered

1378
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:14,680
I'm trying to reach crazy fair to as one of our top supporters and donors and the funders of today's

1379
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,960
Navy source code episode. I quite sure what's going on with this guy.

1380
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,120
We got a couple people. The call will for the show is over.

1381
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,760
Kind of said that all doesn't keep my property. Everybody.

1382
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,960
I'm not sure if you can say I was made for love and hate.

1383
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:55,800
Tonight, I want to give it all to you in the darkness.

1384
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:06,200
That's so much I love you and tonight, I want to play it at your feet.

1385
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:14,200
Cause girl I was made for you and you were made for me.

1386
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:23,640
I was made for love and you made me do what I've made for love and hate.

1387
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:31,240
And I can't get it over you, baby. Can you get it over me?

1388
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:40,440
Tonight, I want to see it go right, feel the magic.

1389
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:47,640
There's something that I've been wanted at this night.

1390
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,400
We're going to make it all come true.

1391
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:59,000
It's a girl you will make for me and girl I was made for you.

1392
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:08,440
I was made for love and you made me do what I've made for love and hate.

1393
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:15,640
And I can't get it over you, baby. Can you get it over me?

1394
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:23,480
I was made for love and you made me do what I've made for love and hate.

1395
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:30,440
And I can't get it over you, baby. Can you get it over me?

1396
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,640
Tonight, I want to see it go right, feel the magic.

1397
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:57,640
There's something that I've been wanted at this night.

1398
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:29,240
I was made for love and you made me do what I've made for love and you made me do what I've made for love and hate.

1399
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:50,840
I was made for love and you made me do what I've made for love and hate.

1400
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,680
And I can't get it over you, baby.

1401
01:37:54,680 --> 01:38:00,600
What now? The call the crisis. I've faced a crisis. I've turned on your Skype.

1402
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:05,240
I've tried to make good on my promises here. You need the Skype's up, baby.

1403
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,960
Here's how I was made for love and you and lovely Miss Mickey.

1404
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,120
You just got back from wherever she was and oh man, she's so nice.

1405
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:20,760
She brought me a tasty, month-centose sandwich from Subway, lovely.

1406
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:26,760
And of course, that's the best of my spear, which is really what everybody loves when we hit that on the show.

1407
01:38:50,760 --> 01:39:06,760
All this energy coming me. Back where it comes from. It's such a crude attitude.

1408
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:14,760
It's back where it'd be lies. All the little kids growing up on the skin, so don't leave them rocks.

1409
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:21,560
Leave the rocks, time and change. You need the emergency. Go, leave the rocks.

1410
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:29,560
Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks.

1411
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:37,960
Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Mama knows what she doesn't care. She's got worries too.

1412
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:45,320
Seven kids, I'm on your fair, and the grandest in all you.

1413
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:51,720
All little chicks with a grand-centose, go, leave the rocks. Leave the rocks.

1414
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:58,280
Leave it in sync with the safety, bit your, leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks.

1415
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:01,320
Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks. Leave the rocks.

1416
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:11,320
I've got some records from World War II

1417
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:14,320
I play them just like me granddaddy

1418
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:18,320
It was a rocker and I am too old

1419
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,320
Can you believe that rocks?

1420
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,320
Can you believe that rocks?

1421
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,320
Can you believe that rocks?

1422
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:37,320
Cleveland rocks, Cleveland rocks, Cleveland rocks

1423
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:42,320
Cleveland rocks, Cleveland rocks

1424
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:49,320
All across, there's the official home of the Rock and Roll Hollow's fame

1425
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,320
Cleveland, Ohio Great Rock

1426
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,320
Alright, come close.

1427
01:40:55,320 --> 01:41:02,320
Alright, I want you to stick the earbuds really deep into your ear for a second.

1428
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,320
But I have some little secret I have to share with you.

1429
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,320
We just have to whisper.

1430
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,320
No one else needs to know.

1431
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:13,320
I push my fingers into my veins.

1432
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:20,320
It's the old day, so it stops the egg.

1433
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:27,320
I thought it's made of all the things I have to take.

1434
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,320
She's a smell of land.

1435
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,320
It was its way inside.

1436
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,320
It's the fading side.

1437
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,320
Good night.

1438
01:41:50,320 --> 01:42:03,320
I am streaming till my face collapsed.

1439
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,320
I've waited as my time to last.

1440
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:08,320
Now all I do is live with so much pain.

1441
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,320
I wish for this, I've missed it out.

1442
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,320
I'm left behind as little fat you can't show what you did not create.

1443
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:18,320
I've got to say what I've got to say in the last world.

1444
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:21,320
I've got to say what I've got to say in the last world.

1445
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,320
I guess I'll claim the best for last.

1446
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,320
My greatest feeling is like one of the best.

1447
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,320
You love the way you can see the pain.

1448
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,320
No one else needs to know.

1449
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:34,320
I've pushed my fingers into my veins.

1450
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:41,320
It's the old day, so it stops the egg.

1451
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,320
It's the fading side.

1452
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:46,320
I've not got to make it.

1453
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,320
Not a aid.

1454
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:56,320
Look me!

1455
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,320
With all my love.

1456
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:01,320
It made me feel like a pain.

1457
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:05,320
Now all I do is live with so much pain.

1458
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,320
You're no more Attorney for this day.

1459
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:14,320
I've got to say what I've got to say in the last world.

1460
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:20,120
It's not the day, but it's made of all

1461
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:24,120
The things I have to tell the day

1462
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,720
It's just never meant

1463
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:31,120
What's it like inside?

1464
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,120
The pain is on

1465
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,520
I'm not gonna make it

1466
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:49,560
Oh God I've got all the things

1467
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,220
Made All I've got

1468
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:57,600
All I've got is the pain

1469
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,080
Oh God is inside

1470
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,560
Oh God

1471
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,080
God is inside

1472
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:09,920
Oh God already inside

1473
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,240
Oh God

1474
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,560
Oh God

1475
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,020
You got it Einstein!

1476
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,840
The separation is not your lie!

1477
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,340
OH, there an ice in the open

1478
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:31,940
Speak slowly andms me now!

1479
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:38,200
It goes main for the things God has to say!

1480
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:42,960
Children'll never ask for his help!

1481
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:49,560
And I hate the pain of God, I'm not going to make us

1482
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,560
All of us, all of God is insane

1483
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:10,560
All of God's sins, all of God is insane

1484
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:15,560
All of God's sins, all of God is insane

1485
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,560
All of God's sins, all of God is insane

1486
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:25,560
Yeah, nothing like a little bit of slip, not for everybody here on the daily source code

1487
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,560
A lot of work going on behind the scenes, and we're actually going to dial in live right now

1488
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,560
With crazy fair to one of our largest supporters

1489
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,560

So what happened, dude? Did you get the wrong Skype name?

1493
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:45,560
Yeah, I think I did

1494
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:50,560
I was looking at the notice you emailed me and it had a different Skype name than the one that I got now

1495
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,560
So we're all set, we're good

1496
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:54,560

Okay

1499
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,560
The northern part of all of this is happening, and it's about to

1500
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,560
One of the clicks from from Amsterdam

1501
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,560
Yeah, and it's only about a hundred clicks out of the North Pole

1502
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:14,560
Yeah, so it must be colder than a witch's tip up there right now

1503
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:21,560
Yeah, man, it's freezing out here, it's about minus 10 degrees, the Celsius

1504
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,560
And lots of snow and it's better to stay in the calculation on my iPad

1505
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,560
To the DSC with Bobby eating up my side of the shipwalk

1506
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,560
I mean, hey, man, what else would you like on a Friday night

1507
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:40,560
I'm wondering how many guys are sitting there behind their computer or as you are with your iPad on the couch

1508
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,560
And you know that you're girlfriend, your wife is near buying just like a looking at Bobby eating pictures

1509
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:48,560
And I'm listening to the DSC and I'm in the chat room

1510
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,560
I know what's going on

1511
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:57,560
Hey, man, I want to tell you, I'm in a private conversation with Bobby at this moment

1512
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:03,560
And hey, I want to default the sun, I would request it, I want to default it to Bobby

1513
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:08,560
Okay, well, first of all, crazy character, you came in at a hundred dollars on support for the show

1514
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,560
Which I really really appreciate and of course that gives you not only an executive producer credit for the show

1515
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:17,560
But also a well, this guy call, of course, and the dedication

1516
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,560
So I'd say, I want you to hit it, man, I got it all cute up for you

1517
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:26,560
All right, so I'm gonna dedicate this song, I like big bucks to Bobby eat

1518
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,560
And I mean, hey, man, this perfect suits are well

1519
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:36,560
I believe she goes, um, I'm seeing sometimes during the city and hey, Bobby, when you're listening

1520
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,560
I believe she will get out in about 10 minutes, she has to sleep as well

1521
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,560
I would say, um, you know how to reach me

1522
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,560
You're a crazy man indeed

1523
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,560
All right, but I think

1524
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,560
Thank you

1525
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,560
Yeah, right, so if you're being such a douchebag, um, all these all these weeks

01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:59,560
Well, hey, I'm happy to, to don't I just a hundred dollars in this penis, right?

1527
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,560
No, man, oh, no, no, no, no, let me deduce it

1528
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:10,560
You've been deduce and since since you're trying to get into Bobby's pants, I'll give you a little bit of karma for that

1529
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,560
You've got karma

All right, take care, bye bye

1533
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,560
Oh, my god, Becky, look at her bet

01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:27,560
It's so big

1535
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:34,560
She looks like one of those rap guys girlfriends, but you know, who understands those rap guys

1536
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:39,560
They only talked to her because she looks like a total prostitute

1537
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,560
Okay, I mean, her bet

1538
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,560
It's just so big

1539
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:47,560
I can't believe it's so round, it's like out there, I mean

You want to pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

I've seen a dance in

01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,560
To hell with a grown man, since he's sweat

1554
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,560
We've got to go on like a turbo flat

1555
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,560
I'm tired of magazines, and flat, but solve a thing

1556
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,560
To the average black man, and ask him about

I'm gonna cut so a hitch out, but I gotta be straight

1579
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:38,560
When I say I wanna, to the break of dawn

01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,560
I'm gonna be gotta goin' on, all the same flow

1581
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,560
Like this song, cause it pops like a hit, quit it

1582
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,560
And I'd rather stay in play, cause I'm long

1583
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,560
And I'm strong, and I'm down to get the friction on

1584
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:52,560
So ladies, ladies, people wanna roll my Mercedes

1585
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,560

01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:06,560
Baby got back, yeah baby

1588
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:12,560
When I come to females, pass my way, got nothing to do with my selection

1589
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,560
36, 24, 36

1590
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,560
Only if she's five, three

1591
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:22,560
So you girlfriend rolls the hunt, playin' workout, taste my fun

1592
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,560
But find that ain't gotta motorin' about the hunt

My anoconda don't want none unless you got buns on

1594
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,560
You can do side bins or sit-ups, but please don't lose that butt

1595
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,560
Some brother wanna playin' hard roll, and take it at the bank

1596
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:41,560
Go, so they toss it, and leave it, and I pull up quick to retrieve it

1597
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:44,560
So Cosmos says you're fat, we're ain't down with that

1598
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,560
Cause you're wasting small and it curves off kickin'

1599
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,560
And I'm thinkin' my stickin' to the bean pole dames and the magazines

You ain't it, Miss Thing, give me a six-star can resist

01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,560
Yeah, pull up quick to get with them

1605
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,560
So ladies, if the butt is round, and you wanna triple, let's go down

1606
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:11,560
So I won 900 mixed a lot, and kicked them nasty thoughts

1607
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:12,560

Lilling a meal, but you got much fat

1612
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,560
Lilling a meal, but you got much fat

1613
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:06,560
I miss this girl who's trying to tell me

So it's a love of all I know

1616
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:16,560
And money will still go through

1617
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,560
Now that we're tired, we shall be all killed

1618

Now that we're tired, we shall be all right

1620

No one will teach you what I want to make

1621
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:36,560
Shake me all night, just let it shake me

1622

Shake it down, break it, break it, break it, shake me

I know you'll be with me

1625
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:55,560
Spending lots of money all right

1626
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:59,560
I never read it down, out of my hand

1627
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,560
And now that you make so thousand calls

1628

Here's me a squeeze, catch my tip and roll

1629
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,560
Now that we're tired, we shall be all tied

And we were second and never played

1631

I'll see you've done it in the middle of the night

1632

Nothing on your house, or something up to you

I was happy when you were seen

1657
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:01,880
I've got to wake up, I've got to pull around the lights, I'm talking to you

01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:18,320
All night, in the middle of the night, in the air

1661
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:26,320
The sisters took me to the gate door

1662
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,320
And those were just a few seconds ago

1663
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:32,320
We had a week to sit with things all day

1664
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,320
And how the sound is she makes you get away

1665
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:38,320
And those got ready to go

1666
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:41,320
Time's worth the free for the show

1667
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:44,320
Let out our children we don't know

1668
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,320
And I can't walk in, walking in, walking in

1669
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:49,320
We can feel the fire, and the melody

1670
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:53,320
Oh yeah, so high, so good to feel

1671
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:56,320
fucking the melody, yeah, hi, yeah

1672
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
Oh, night, in the middle of the night

1673
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,320
We can feel the fire, and the melody, yeah

1674
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:38,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1675
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:54,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know.

1676
01:58:54,480 --> 01:59:24,480
But you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

1677
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:47,640
you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey nah nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1678
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:59,080
I'm pretty sure when I first arrived on the scene at MTV and the mids 80s, that night

1679
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:03,880
Ranger was actually the punchline of many industry jokes.

1680
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:10,560
But I've learned that the arrogance of mainstream media is so far of bays that it's

1681
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,000
often the biggest hits that people absolutely want to hear.

1682
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:16,640
That's why I got no shame bitches.

1683
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:20,880
I'll roll it out for you because you can still rock in America.

1684
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,480
That's my Ranger on the Charlie.

1685
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,320
Chainsley mood just a little bit as we roll into our third hour.

1686
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,360
There's a little bit of back eating swing for you because you know,

1687
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,760
you can't go back to Jersey babies.

1688
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,000
If you are from the garden state,

1689
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,960
what's your good jersey maybe never to go back now?

1690
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,480
Pick it y'all.

1691
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
If you are from the garden state,

1692
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
if you are from the garden state,

1693
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
if you are from the garden state,

1694
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
if you are from the garden state,

1695
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
if you are from the garden state,

1696
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
if you are from the garden state,

1697
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
if you are from the garden state,

1698
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
if you are from the garden state,

1699
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
if you are from the garden state,

1700
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
if you are from the garden state,

1701
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
if you are from the garden state,

1702
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
if you are from the garden state,

1703
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,000
if you are from the garden state,

1704
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,000
if you are from the garden state,

1705
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,200
if you are from the garden state,

1706
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:54,960
if you are from the garden state,

1707
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
if you are from the garden state,

1708
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
if you are from the garden state,

1709
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,040
if you are from the garden state,

1710
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,040
Just if I let the girls make me mad

1711
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:11,040
I take and touch it getting up a smile

1712
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,540
And leave it, get that in ground for a little while

1713
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:15,540
And make the lamp off, drink all day

1714
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:17,040
She's from me in the face and say

1715
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,540
I can't go in there, man

1716
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:21,040
I take it like a jersey, ain't goin' back

1717
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:23,040
Keep up like the jersey, ain't goin' back

1718
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,040
Keep up like the jersey, ain't goin' back

1719
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:28,040
I can go back, you gotta do me like that

1720
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,040
Go back, you gotta do me like that

1721
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,040
Go back, you gotta jersey, ain't goin' back

1722
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,040
Keep up like the jersey, ain't goin' back

1723
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:36,040
Keep up like the jersey, ain't goin' back

1724
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:38,040
You'reイ'in a way too big and gotta do me like that

1725
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:39,040
Go back, you gotta do me like that

1726
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:41,040
Like, don't you and the dosya

1727
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:44,940
Now get losty

1728
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,600
Don't move around, oh missed it

1729
02:02:47,780 --> 02:03:04,780
Don't move around, oh missed the

1730
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:06,400
Flows, you can't do that.

1731
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,020
Hey, all my friends, I'll see you on them around my booth.

1732
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:11,020
Hey, all my friends, I'll see you on them around my booth.

1733
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:15,020
And my main objective is to keep the bear with what's left left right.

1734
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:18,020
And the night before, last night, something's wrong with that.

1735
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:21,020
My girl, to sit your waist and release you down my phone.

1736
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:22,020
Why?

1737
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:23,020
Because you just do my shit.

1738
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:25,020
I thought we don't want to block.

1739
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:27,020
I pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1740
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:29,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1741
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:32,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1742
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:33,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1743
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:37,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1744
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:40,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1745
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:43,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1746
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:46,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1747
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:49,020
If you pick up my guitar and see it ain't going back.

1748
02:04:03,020 --> 02:04:04,020
I like that man.

1749
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:06,020
It's kind of rocking that.

1750
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:19,620
Can't go back to Jersey, now I get more and more radio guys, why see tweeting about this show is really outrageous. I have to tell you how cool it is.

1751
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:32,620
The idea of complete lemonade, the whole idea of an open source show where you guys are basically putting it together by dropping tunes in your box sharing those with me.

1752
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:40,420
I'm now at about 40 gigs worth of dropbox files, so please, I'm trying to clean up stuff from time to time. You might want to consider that.

1753
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:47,620
I was actually funny. I saw, you know, I get these growl notifications. I got a note that said, do not delete.

1754
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:53,620
So I guess I don't put a file in that one of their folders, do not delete.txt. It says, do not delete has been deleted.

1755
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:57,620
They're like, wow, we have a lot to learn when it comes to the interface.

1756
02:04:57,620 --> 02:05:04,620
So this morning, you know, usually once a day, and I do this for a very particular reason, and the reason why I did it was right.

1757
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:10,620
I log on to the bank account. And as you know, we have no credit cards.

1758
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:14,620
Wish I could do only with cash. But of course, you have to have a debit card.

1759
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:19,620
Which, ours happened to also be accepted as credit cards. Only there's no credit on it.

1760
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:24,620
As you know, I'm patently on credit worthy and unhierable and all that stuff.

1761
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:38,620
And I'm like, I couldn't believe my eyes. I'm like, there's like $500 ATM withdrawals in Sacramento, in woodland hills, like all over California, like what that was going on.

1762
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:43,620
And yet, loan behold, someone had a cloned, I think, Mickey's card.

1763
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:46,620
And somehow actually got her pin card.

1764
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:51,620
The pin number, and was withdrawing money. Now I have to say luckily our bank immediately said, no problem.

1765
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:54,620
We'll refund y'all the money and they have to open an investigation all that.

1766
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:59,620
But they say that they will refund the money, I guess, Monday.

1767
02:05:59,620 --> 02:06:05,620
But it's a couple thousand dollars and like, holy crap. And these days, by the way, the kind hurts.

1768
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:15,620
Although I have to say the value you guys have provided me for doing this show is exactly what I used to make for doing a four hour.

1769
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:22,620
Uh, weekend shift on Z100. Now I granted there were so many commercial I didn't talk as much or play as much music.

1770
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:30,620
But it's, uh, and of course there's no real adjustment for inflation. But wow. I mean, the system works. I fucking love it.

1771
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:36,620
Anyway, to the whole of the debit card thing, maybe think of this song, which loan behold showed up in the Dropbox.

1772
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:44,620
Your cell phone, your world, your time, your ideas, no barcode, no party, no ideas, no beers.

1773
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:51,620
Your fan card, your license, your thoughts, your fears, no sim card, no disco, no photo, not here.

1774
02:06:51,620 --> 02:07:04,620
Your blood, your sweat, your passions, your regrets, your profits, your time off your sessions, your sex, your pills, your grass, your dudes, your laughs, your thoughts.

1775
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:07,620
We won't be drunk, your soul.

1776

1778
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:35,620
Your life.

1781
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:42,620
Take credit, take insurance, take a loan.

1782
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:45,620
Get a job, get a bench, get a haircut, get a suit.

1783
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:49,620
Playings are lottery, play you football, play the fields, or some too.

1784
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:52,620
We'll show you three, we'll show you three, we'll buy you three.

1785
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:54,620
Tell me, you want to know where to sell you crap, we'll judge you.

1786
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:57,620
We're gonna buy big things, we'll run the cash.

1787
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:07,620
Show me, you want your soul.

1788
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:10,620
You want your soul.

1789
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:12,620
You want your emotions.

1790
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:15,620
You're love, you're dreams, you're chapel.

1791
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:19,620
You're residents, you're sweet, you're screens, you're security, you're subrionic.

1792
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:26,620

1793
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:28,620
Go back to bed, America.

1794
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:31,620
Your government is at control again.

1795
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:32,620

They're trying to call me for a tough year.

02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,560
There's long pictures, video game, here's cool.

1808
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,560
A lot of here's tin, though, and here's two turtins.

1809
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:22,560
Here's collagen, and here's all my nails.

1810
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:23,560
We're lost together.

1811
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:24,560
We're lost together.

1812
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:25,560
We're lost together.

1813
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:27,560
We're lost together.

1814
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:45,560
Now, right now, all we need from people, if you can't be part of a medical team or a search and

1815
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,560
recipe team, we just need cash.

1816
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:52,560
I know a lot of people want to send blankets or water, just send you cash.

1817
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:53,560
Watch this.

1818
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:54,560
Shut up.

1819
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,560
Go back to bed, America.

02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:08,560
And congratulate you on living in the land of freedom.

1824
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:09,560
Here you go, America.

1825

You are free.

1826
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,560
You're too as my turn.

You're so.

02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:24,560

Arthas mayonnaise

1867
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:22,620
Hey, man, so are you in now you're in Canada aren't you? Yes, we're going to get

1868
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:27,620
my nation frozen north. Send them all your oil. That's right. It's and thank you so

1869
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:32,060
much for being our source of foreign oil. We're coming to kick your ass soon enough.

1870
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:36,620
Yes, we will look forward to our new masters. Yes. Now, do you have the lovely

1871
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:42,220
Dame Andrea there as well? I'm here. Yeah, she's right here beside me. Yeah, but you see

1872
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:46,460
and see, you were kind enough to turn on the camera, but I'm like, I'm like crying

1873
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:50,620
in my neck and I'm trying to get a good look. Is she off screen on purpose? Is that

1874
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:57,780
what she's done there? Hey, how are you doing, girl? Hell yeah, it's time to get up north.

1875
02:12:57,860 --> 02:13:06,580
Ah, you crazy kid. Nice, nice apple t-shirt, by the way, they're so Kelly. You work for

1876
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:12,420
the Uber Lords? Somewhat, yes, we work for an oil field service company side by side here

1877
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:17,220
in our office, yes. Excellent. So what now is it really cold up north there right now?

1878
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:21,940
Or is that just a myth? That's about minus seven degrees Celsius here. So it's a nice

1879
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:28,020
warm day today. Yeah, holy crap. You know, I actually sat outside my t-shirt and the

1880
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:34,180
people's Republic of Southern California this morning was so nice. So listen to our song that we

1881
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:40,260
requested because we're on our way to Hawaii on Monday. Oh, that's so nice. Is this a vacation

1882
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:45,860
or work or what? For a vacation and we're taking all our kids with us, so it's going to be quite

1883
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:51,780
a pack. Okay, now which island are you going to? To Maui. Oh, man, that's so beautiful. You'll

1884
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:56,820
really love it there. How many kids you guys got? Three between us were a blended family plus

1885
02:13:56,820 --> 02:14:02,660
taking one more friends kid along with us too. Holy crap. God bless you, man. That's a,

1886
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:07,700
are you going to get any rest of those of vacation? Well, they're teenagers. So they don't

1887
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:12,660
want nothing to do with us anyway. So that's right. Right, right, right, yeah, yeah, I know what

1888
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:18,180
you mean. Mine is a teenager no more, but the pain is still there. She's gone from 19 to 20. I was like,

1889
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:24,260
oh my god, it never stops. So circaling in demand, we really appreciate your support for the show.

1890
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:30,020
Double Nichols on the dime, of course, a code for being a no agenda minute man and minute woman,

1891
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:35,700
I presume. And that's very, very nice. I really appreciate you doing that. And that's how long

1892
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:38,980
you're going to be on vacation. You're going to be able to get the no agenda show while you're there?

1893
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:45,780
Yes, we should be able to stream it. We'll be there for a week. So there's Wi-Fi in the condo. So I think we're

1894
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:51,220
excellent. Excellent. All right. Well, you requested a song, which you were kind enough to put in the

1895
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:55,860
drop box. So I didn't have to, so I didn't have to go and find it. You want to set it up for me? We'll play it.

1896
02:14:56,900 --> 02:15:03,540
Yes, being that we're Canadians going to the way the hit a way by the young Canadians seem

1897
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:09,380
appropriate. All right. You guys have a great time, okay? Thanks a lot. Thanks again for all the

1898
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:13,780
support. I'll see you. And enjoy your tune. All right.

1899
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:17,540
And for the fun, we're going to fucking Las Vegas. No one in the sun, we're stuck with it,

1900
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:25,460
we're out there for the fun, running from the rain, passing down the river. And you like the rich,

1901
02:16:25,460 --> 02:16:32,420
and for the fun, we're here. We're coming to the air, seven, four, and seven, and you

1902
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:39,460
chat to the moon, we're going to summer, save our money. So I think we're going to fucking

1903
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:47,460
our way, and we're going to fucking our way, and we're going to fucking our way, and we're going to

1904
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:55,460
fucking the rain, passing down the river. And we're going to fucking our way, and we're going to

1905
02:16:56,180 --> 02:17:05,460
the second best thing you can do by yourself. And morning, morning,

1906
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:09,620
we're going to be on fire as soon as we arrive.

1907
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:38,460
You skin makes you cry

1908
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:43,460
You float like a feather

1909
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:48,460
In a beautiful world

1910
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:53,460
I wish I was special

1911
02:17:55,460 --> 02:17:58,460
You're so very special

1912
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:03,460
But I'm a tree

1913
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:09,460
I'm alone

1914
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:14,460
What the hell about you?

1915
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:20,460
I don't belong here

1916
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:24,460
It's okay

1917
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:29,460
I wanna have to show

1918
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:35,460
I wanna have to fight it

1919
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:40,460
I wanna have to show

1920
02:18:43,460 --> 02:18:46,460
I want you to know this

1921
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:50,460
But I'm not around

1922
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:56,460
You're so very special

1923
02:18:56,460 --> 02:19:01,460
I wish I was special

1924
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:06,460
But I'm a tree

1925
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:12,460
I'm alone

1926
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:17,460
What the hell about you?

1927
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:22,460
I don't belong here

1928
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:29,460
It's okay

1929
02:19:30,460 --> 02:19:34,460
You're so very special

1930
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:38,460
It's okay

1931
02:19:39,460 --> 02:19:41,460
It's okay

1932
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:44,460
It's okay

1933
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:49,460
I wanna have to fight it

1934
02:19:56,460 --> 02:20:01,460
I wanna have to fight it

1935
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:08,460
What the hell about you?

1936
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:13,460
Whatever you want

1937
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:18,460
Just love my special

1938
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:21,460
Excuse me, I was very special

1939
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:24,460
I wish I was special

1940
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:29,460
I wanna have to fight it

1941
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:49,460
I feel like I belong here

1942
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:52,460
With my friends, Chuckleheads, all in the chat room

1943
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:54,460
Boots on the ground, ships at sea

1944
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:57,460
And the human resources, charged up and ready to go

1945
02:20:58,460 --> 02:20:59,460
All pretty much waiting for one thing

1946
02:21:00,460 --> 02:21:01,460
Comic strip

1947
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:04,460
Comic strip

1948
02:21:06,460 --> 02:21:07,460
Comic strip

1949
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:11,460
Comic strip

1950
02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:15,460
And come on in my European Union correspondent friend

1951
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:17,460
Comic strip blogger, Yeho

1952
02:21:17,460 --> 02:21:19,460
Hello Adam

1953
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:22,460
Hi Erlin, astronaut Eshol

1954
02:21:24,460 --> 02:21:26,460
No man, I don't do that anymore

1955
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:28,460
I wish I was

1956
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:31,460
Here is CSB, you always say the correspondent

1957
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:33,460
Yes, so Adam

1958
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:35,460
Don't hate me please

1959
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:38,460
But WikiLeaks indeed reveals some interesting stuff

1960
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:42,460
Like recent races of some EU commissioners

1961
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:45,460
Now this is the whole thing about WikiLeaks

1962
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:48,460
And I get a lot of E-MailC, a lot of conversation going on

1963
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:51,460
Of course on the know agenda show, we assert that WikiLeaks

1964
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:54,460
Definitely a front for the CIA or some other agency

1965
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:57,460
And they leaked stuff when appropriate for someone's agenda

1966
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:01,460
That's not to discount what's in the memos

1967
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:03,460
But it's also not really new

1968
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:07,460
A lot of this stuff we've actually discussed on the show

1969
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:11,460
And besides that, 3 million people had access to these cables

1970
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:14,460
Because they were not marked top secret, they were confidential

1971
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:17,460
And there's different levels of confidentiality

1972
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,460
3 million people in the police state of Gitmo Nation

1973
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:22,460
United States had access to it

1974
02:22:23,460 --> 02:22:25,460
So it's not like it's a huge secret

1975
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:27,460
And

1976
02:22:28,460 --> 02:22:29,460
I'll let you finish

1977
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:32,460
From West EU towards East EU

1978
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:35,460
But one important thing is this is in this quote

1979
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:40,460
Europeans may agree or disagree with US policy

1980
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:47,460
What Europeans admire is that US is ready to carry out the policies

1981
02:22:48,460 --> 02:22:49,460
It thinks best

1982
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:52,460
No matter what the rest of the world thinks

1983
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:55,460
Well, I think that's actually a very sad statement

1984
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:58,460
I don't know what your take on it on the whole thing is

1985
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:00,460
But to me that means we're so docile

1986
02:23:01,460 --> 02:23:03,460
We've been floored in it with so much crap in the water

1987
02:23:04,460 --> 02:23:06,460
And there's spraying so much crap in the air

1988
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:09,460
We're like, whatever. Yeah, dude, we just rock and kick ass

1989
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:12,460
Yeah, we'll do it. Yeah, we'll go along with that no problem

1990
02:23:13,460 --> 02:23:16,460
So what of course is not the end of quote

1991
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:19,460
What of course is not possible in you because some countries are mortgages

1992
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:23,460
And other less cases, cautious and opinion

1993
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:26,460
It's not the same concept like USA

1994
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:29,460
Well, no, it's not the same because let me think

1995
02:23:30,460 --> 02:23:32,460
What's the difference? Oh, yeah, you don't even get the fake vote

1996
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:35,460
It's for your president of Gitmonation Europe

1997
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:38,460
It's like you don't need to know democratic vote

1998
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:41,460
At least we get the illusion that we're allowed to do that

1999
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:45,460
But USA, USA, I'm a kind of policy of divide in the concs

2000
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:48,460
In European Union, so you're too bit fucking annoying

2001
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:52,460
Other than by the way, stop smoking, matey

2002
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:56,460
No, no, I will eventually, but it's not time yet

2003
02:23:57,460 --> 02:23:59,460
No, quiet. Oh, that was it, you

2004
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:04,460
Oh, comic strip blogger, you know what, ma'am

2005
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:07,460
Despite all your misguidants, I really do love you

2006
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:12,460
And maybe the song give you a little jolt

2007
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:14,460
It's better than the WikiLeaks Trust me

2008
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:37,460
Even looks like freedom to me

2009
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:41,460
Expressions of liberty

2010
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:45,460
Wonning our America to be

2011
02:24:46,460 --> 02:24:49,460
A responsible agenda for me

2012
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:08,460
Didn't know I was a communist

2013
02:25:09,460 --> 02:25:12,460
But wanting to share the wealth

2014
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:16,460
It doesn't take an economist

2015
02:25:17,460 --> 02:25:20,460
To measure the cost of health

2016
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:23,460
And what I believe in

2017
02:25:23,460 --> 02:25:26,460
Looks like ever to me

2018
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:30,460
Won human fame

2019
02:25:31,460 --> 02:25:35,460
Where everybody's got enough to eat

2020
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:39,460
It's something I want to cover to feed

2021
02:25:55,460 --> 02:25:58,460
Didn't know I was a level of terrorist

2022
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:01,460
For Darren to speak my mind

2023
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:05,460
This becoming more precarious

2024
02:26:07,460 --> 02:26:09,460
For failing to toe the line

2025
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:12,460
In what I believe in

2026
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:15,460
Sounds like freedom to me

2027
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:19,460
Like the sons of liberty

2028
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:23,460
In 1773

2029
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:28,460
Dumping 45 tons of tea

2030
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:47,460
The norm was in the minority

2031
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:51,460
All people who love the earth

2032
02:26:53,460 --> 02:26:55,460
I hope that there comes a priority

2033
02:26:57,460 --> 02:26:59,460
Before I get any worse

2034
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:02,460
And what I believe in

2035
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:05,460
Looks like ever to me

2036
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:09,460
Where angels take the shape of a tree

2037
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:13,460
Giving us clear air to breathe

2038
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:17,460
From the river to the mountain to the stream

2039
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:37,460
The no I hated my country

2040
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:41,460
But acknowledging the truth

2041
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:45,460
This was despicable prophecy ring

2042
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:49,460
At the expense of our youth

2043
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:52,460
In what I believe in

2044
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:55,460
Looks like ever to me

2045
02:27:56,460 --> 02:28:00,460
All of your men are seen

2046
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:04,460
Living as community

2047
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:07,460
And rather too long

2048
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:23,460
I know it's just a song

2049
02:28:24,460 --> 02:28:28,460
But if the whole world sang alone

2050
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:35,460
How much longer would it be this way

2051
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:41,460
But if the whole world sang alone

2052
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:48,460
How much longer would it be this way

2053
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:52,460
She was living in a single room with three other individuals

2054
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:56,460
One of them was a male and the other two were females

2055
02:28:57,460 --> 02:28:59,460
Not only knows what they were up to and there

2056
02:28:59,460 --> 02:29:02,460
And furthermore Susan I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn

2057
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:05,460
That all four of them are betually smoked marijuana cigarettes

2058
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:08,460
Refers

2059
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:31,460
I smoke to drugs in the morning

2060
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:33,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2061
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:36,460
I smoke to drugs in the afternoon

2062
02:29:37,460 --> 02:29:38,460
It makes me feel alright

2063
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:41,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2064
02:29:42,460 --> 02:29:43,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2065
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:46,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2066
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:48,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2067
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:51,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2068
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:54,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2069
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:57,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2070
02:29:58,460 --> 02:30:00,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2071
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:02,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2072
02:30:03,460 --> 02:30:04,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2073
02:30:05,460 --> 02:30:06,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2074
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:08,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2075
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:09,460

I smoke to drugs in the night

2081
02:30:20,460 --> 02:30:22,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2082
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:24,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2083
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:27,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2084
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:29,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2085
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:31,460

I smoke to drugs in the night

2091
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:14,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2092
02:31:15,460 --> 02:31:17,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2093
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:21,460
I smoke to drugs in the night

2094
02:31:39,460 --> 02:31:41,460
This life.

2095
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:43,460
I don't care about nothing, man.

2096
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:47,460
Roll another plant.

2097
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:48,460
Eee.

2098
02:31:48,460 --> 02:31:52,460
Oh, be careful.

2099
02:31:52,460 --> 02:31:53,460
Eee.

2100
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:57,460
La la la la la, la la, la l, la la.

2101
02:31:57,460 --> 02:32:04,460
La la la, la la, la la, la la, la la, la la la.

2102
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:07,460
Okay, you may sing along a few ways.

2103
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:11,460
I was gonna clean my room until I got high

2104
02:32:11,460 --> 02:32:17,460
I was gonna get up and find the room, but then I got high

2105
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:33,460
I was gonna go to class before I got high

2106
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:35,460
Come on, y'all

2107
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:37,460
I could've cheated and I could've passed

2108
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:39,460
But I got high

2109
02:32:39,460 --> 02:32:41,460
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

2110
02:32:41,460 --> 02:32:43,460
I'm taking a next semester

2111
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:45,460
And I know why

2112
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:47,460
Because I got high

2113
02:32:47,460 --> 02:32:49,460
Because I got high

2114
02:32:49,460 --> 02:32:51,460
Because I got high

2115
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:53,460
I was gonna go to class before I got high

2116
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:55,460
I was gonna go to work

2117
02:32:55,460 --> 02:32:57,460
But then I got high

2118
02:32:57,460 --> 02:33:01,460
I just got a new promotion

2119
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:03,460
But I got high

2120
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:05,460
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

2121
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:07,460
I was selling dope

2122
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:09,460
And I know why

2123
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:11,460
Because I got high

2124
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:13,460
Because I got high

2125
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:15,460
Because I got high

2126
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:19,460
I was gonna go to class before I got high

2127
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:21,460
Uh, uh, uh

2128
02:33:21,460 --> 02:33:23,460
I was gonna pay my child support

2129
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:25,460
But then I got high

2130
02:33:25,460 --> 02:33:27,460
No, you wait

2131
02:33:27,460 --> 02:33:29,460
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

2132
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:31,460
And I know why

2133
02:33:31,460 --> 02:33:33,460
Uh, uh, uh, uh

2134
02:33:33,460 --> 02:33:35,460
Because I got high

2135
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:37,460
Because I got high

2136
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:39,460
No, no, no, no, no

2137
02:33:39,460 --> 02:33:41,460
I wasn't gonna run from the cops

2138
02:33:41,460 --> 02:33:43,460
But I was high

2139
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:45,460
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

2140
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:47,460
I was gonna pull right over and stop

2141
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:49,460
But I was high

2142
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:51,460
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

2143
02:33:51,460 --> 02:33:55,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2144
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:57,460
Because I got high

2145
02:33:57,460 --> 02:33:58,460
Because I got high

2146
02:33:58,460 --> 02:34:00,460
Because I got high

2147
02:34:00,460 --> 02:34:02,460
La, la, la, la, la

2148
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:04,460

And I'm thinking maybe we need to crank it up just a little bit.

2247
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:08,000
I think before we get into the typical behavior that happens around this moment in the show

2248
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:11,880
when GX2 gets all cranky, maybe we'll do this for him.

so I let I can't come down because I've been in every town across the nation there should be no stuff

2421
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:15,760
what's going on there, what's going on there, yeah what's going on

I'm the best thing

2434
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:58,440
You can't keep the trap

2435
02:46:58,440 --> 02:46:59,440

2447
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:13,440

02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:14,440
I couldn't

2449
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:15,440

2452
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:18,440

2453
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:19,440
Grezer

2454
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:20,440
Grezer

2455
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:21,440

2460
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:26,440
Come on

2461
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:28,440

2462
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:30,440

2464
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:33,160

02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:35,440
Hurry toSenator

2466
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:38,440
Come on

2467
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:47,440
I don't say go, I don't crazy, I don't mind it

2468
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:50,440
It's in the state, don't fire, go higher

2469
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:53,440
Cause when I'm late for the fire, there's so much broken

2470
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:55,440
Make the whole city rise, there's the fighter

2471
02:47:55,440 --> 02:47:57,440
And they can all hold well, lift it

2472
02:47:57,440 --> 02:48:00,440
One back, and they take the land with a mission

2473
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:02,440
There's no way you can stand this position

2474
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:05,440
You can't dig that heat, get up, about the kitchen

2475
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:07,440
The field the hustle, see we hit in the road

2476
02:48:07,440 --> 02:48:09,440
You'll never stop it, you ain't got the muscle

2477
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:11,440
We're got the full of tall, cold boy, this is the show

2478
02:48:11,440 --> 02:48:14,440
We've got a cure, blow the stage up, we out the door

2479
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:16,440
Sometimes we all need to escape

2480
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:19,440
Some of we fall off track, you get your mind right and make this dance

2481
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:21,440
I made a fight, put my true heart to kill

2482
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:24,440
Look at you, you feel the ball, the people will need that bill

2483
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:29,440
The town's gonna die, I'll be the heart to kill

2484
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:31,440
You'll be the head of the muscle

2485
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:36,440
The town's gonna die, I'll be the head of the muscle

2486
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:41,440
The world's gonna die, I'll be the head of the muscle

2487
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:46,440
The world's gonna die, I'll be the heart to kill

2488
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:48,440
Once again, the message is in the music

2489
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:51,440
You really got to listen for carefully, but it's there, propagate it

2490
02:48:51,440 --> 02:48:53,440
Our formula is this

2491
02:48:53,440 --> 02:48:56,040
We go out, we're here people in the mouth.

2492
02:48:56,040 --> 02:49:01,440
Come on, say it with me now.

2493
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:03,440
Waters.

2494
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:04,440
Waters.

2495
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:07,440
You know what you are?

2496
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:12,440
Shut up, sleigh.

2497
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:17,440
Because if you don't speak, you know, sleigh.

2498
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:19,440
Why are you just a sleigh?

2499
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:21,440
I do what they tell you to do.

2500
02:49:23,440 --> 02:49:28,440
Black Crow has got an answer.

2501
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:33,440
She flew by Friday, 3rd December 2010.

2502
02:49:53,440 --> 02:50:00,440
Blue's too close at the break it down.

2503
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:07,440
A mother said I don't know how to fall this time.

2504
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:13,440
I act to less than the face of your feet.

2505
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:18,440
I never want to let me just say it please.

2506
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:23,440
You want to be here.

2507
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:30,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2508
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:35,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2509
02:50:35,440 --> 02:50:39,440
You don't think like a girl, baby.

2510
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:45,440
Please, let me go take the law.

2511
02:50:45,440 --> 02:50:52,440
Pull the tension to rise above.

2512
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:59,440
But baby, climb both of us in the air.

2513
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:04,440
But that is to be the miracle.

2514
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:09,440
You want to be here.

2515
02:51:09,440 --> 02:51:11,440
But that is not good.

2516
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:13,440
I can stand away.

2517
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:16,440
No, no, no, no.

2518
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:21,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2519
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:25,440
You don't just think like a sleigh, baby.

2520
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:28,440
Please, let me go.

2521
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:34,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2522
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:44,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2523
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:49,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2524
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:54,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2525
02:51:54,440 --> 02:51:58,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2526
02:51:58,440 --> 02:52:02,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2527
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:07,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2528
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:14,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2529
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:19,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2530
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:21,440
But that is not good.

2531
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:25,440
But that is not good.

2532
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:30,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2533
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:36,440
You don't just think like a sleigh, baby.

2534
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:41,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2535
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:45,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2536
02:52:45,440 --> 02:52:53,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2537
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:55,440
But that is not good.

2538
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:59,440
You want to be me as you do now.

2539
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:04,440
I will be my friend.

2540
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:06,200
four-scored episode, eight, five, four,

2541
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:09,800
your football Friday, she and he, baby.

2542
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:11,280
I gotta tell you, you know, I've done many,

2543
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:12,880
many live gigs around,

2544
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:14,120
get my nation, particularly,

2545
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:15,560
and get my nation lowlands.

2546
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:18,000
And one of the jobs of the DJ is to keep

2547
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,560
the crowd kinda quiet, you know,

2548
02:53:19,560 --> 02:53:21,160
when they're acting up, and I'm seeing,

2549
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:23,560
we got a fight brewing here in the chat room.

2550
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:25,840
It's like, we got Marcus Cows on one hand,

2551
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:28,800
and CSB on the other, I'm getting a little worried.

2552
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,360
I don't know if I should tone it down a bit,

2553
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:33,200
so we can all just kinda cool off, chill out.

2554
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:35,800
Or if I should hit your heart,

2555
02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:38,600
I'll choose for the latter.

2556
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:42,600
I haven't played any in nine inch nails in a while.

2557
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:54,600
I've got money, I'll do anything for you.

2558
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:58,800
I've got money, just tell me what you want me to do.

2559
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:03,000
I've got money, now me, I've got so long.

2560
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,160
If I can have money, don't wanna!

2561
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:05,640
I can set hands full once,

2562
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:06,960
that I'll know you!

2563
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:08,440
Ask me how to say my name?

2564
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:14,200
No, it can't!

2565
02:54:22,660 --> 02:54:24,840
Live hall!

2566
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:27,540
Live hall hall hall hall hall hall hall hall hall hall!

2569
02:54:40,560 --> 02:54:45,560
I'll tell you for the one you serve

2570
02:54:45,560 --> 02:54:49,560
You're going to get what you deserve

2571
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:53,560
I'll tell you for the one you serve

2572
02:54:53,560 --> 02:54:58,560
You're going to get what you deserve

2573
02:55:03,560 --> 02:55:05,560
Don't forget to let me go

2574
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:07,960
Ferrari

2575
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:16,840
OK broken money's the smoking full of joy

2576
02:55:16,840 --> 02:55:19,240
If God money's that concerned

2577
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:21,640
But I last kept Это sick of my Mum endured

2578
02:55:21,640 --> 02:55:25,640
For God money let's go dancing on the backs of the rules

2579
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:28,480
At God money's not good

2580
02:55:28,500 --> 02:55:31,540
No you can't take it

2581
02:55:31,540 --> 02:55:33,840

2582
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:35,660
Know ya can't take it.

2583
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:57,960

Without dance, and the whole door, to the gang came through, fit me

Where did all this Mark Duries come from?

From someone tell me how to give me some

On the floor in a car on a seat at the bar wherever I go

2615
02:58:31,460 --> 02:58:33,460
That's where they are

2616
02:58:33,460 --> 02:58:37,460
It's my nose

2617
02:58:37,460 --> 02:58:39,460

I've got a feeling you can show me how

2624
02:59:00,460 --> 02:59:04,460
On a bus, on a train, on a boat, on a plane

2625
02:59:04,460 --> 02:59:06,460
I'm falling in love

2626
02:59:06,460 --> 02:59:08,460

I'm going to be a bad boy

2637
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:45,460
I'm not going to be a bad man

2638
02:59:45,460 --> 03:00:10,460
I don't think that I could choose just one

2639
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:13,660
Well, it'll be smart girls come from

2640
03:00:13,660 --> 03:00:18,460
Someone tell me how to get me slow

2641
03:00:18,460 --> 03:00:21,660
It's not a great need for not really

2642
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:26,060
Which one do I want here with me?

2643
03:00:26,060 --> 03:00:29,260
They're all smart girls

2644
03:00:29,260 --> 03:00:32,060
They're all smart girls

2645
03:00:32,060 --> 03:00:35,260
They're being tied up and tied to you

2646
03:00:35,260 --> 03:00:41,260
And I don't understand how you make me lose my mind

2647
03:00:41,260 --> 03:00:49,260
I like my girls

2648
03:00:49,260 --> 03:00:55,260
Never get enough of those my girls

2649
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:59,260
They're being leveled

03:00:59,260 --> 03:01:01,260
They're all smart girls

2651
03:01:01,260 --> 03:01:05,260
They're all smart girls

2652
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:09,260
They're all smart girls

2653
03:01:09,260 --> 03:01:13,260
They're all smart girls

And niceness in our chat room

2665
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:37,260
This has just gone too far

2666
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:39,260
Remember now, this is a friendly place

2667
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:41,260
It is your daily source code

2668
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:43,260
So maybe if I just change the music

2669
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:45,260

03:02:03,260 --> 03:02:07,260
Pay your own kid

2676
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:13,260
Money

2677
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:17,260
It's against

2678
03:02:17,260 --> 03:02:21,260
Grab that cash with both hands

2679
03:02:21,260 --> 03:02:23,260
And make a stretch

2680
03:02:27,260 --> 03:02:29,260
Look hard, can we learn

2681
03:02:29,260 --> 03:02:31,260
For a start and dream

2682
03:02:31,260 --> 03:02:35,260
Think about me a football

2683
03:02:45,260 --> 03:02:47,260
Money

2684
03:02:49,260 --> 03:02:50,260
Get back

2685
03:02:51,260 --> 03:02:59,260
I'm on right, Jack, keep your hands off my

2686
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:01,260
Stay

2687
03:03:03,260 --> 03:03:05,260
Money

2688
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:07,260
It's a hit

2689
03:03:07,260 --> 03:03:11,260
But don't give me that

2690
03:03:11,260 --> 03:03:17,260
You're good, you're good, you're good

2691
03:03:17,260 --> 03:03:21,260
I'm in the hot pot

2692
03:03:21,260 --> 03:03:25,260
Feel the first glass drum set

2693
03:03:25,260 --> 03:03:29,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2694
03:03:47,260 --> 03:03:51,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2695
03:03:51,260 --> 03:03:53,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2696
03:03:53,260 --> 03:03:55,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2697
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:57,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2698
03:03:57,260 --> 03:03:59,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2699
03:03:59,260 --> 03:04:01,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2700
03:04:01,260 --> 03:04:03,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2701
03:04:03,260 --> 03:04:05,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2702
03:04:05,260 --> 03:04:07,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2703
03:04:07,260 --> 03:04:09,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2704
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:11,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2705
03:04:11,260 --> 03:04:13,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2706
03:04:13,260 --> 03:04:15,260
I think I need a little ear chat

2707
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:17,260
Oh well

2708
03:04:17,260 --> 03:04:18,260
Yes

2709
03:04:20,260 --> 03:04:23,260
It's a crime

2710
03:04:23,260 --> 03:04:25,260
It's a crime

2711
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:29,260
Carefully

2712
03:04:29,260 --> 03:04:33,260
But don't take the slice of my pie

2713
03:04:33,260 --> 03:04:37,260
Money

2714
03:04:37,260 --> 03:04:44,260
I'm willing so they sing

2715
03:04:45,260 --> 03:04:52,260
There's the moon of all the old two days

2716
03:04:55,260 --> 03:05:06,260
For the few as clear as it's most impressive in the universe

2717
03:05:08,260 --> 03:05:13,260
We've entered into the lounge portion of the show where we help you meet music and children from other lands

2718
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:19,260
This guy's name is Frank Bennett, which I'm sure is a mashup of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett

2719
03:05:20,260 --> 03:05:25,260
And throw in some tinfoil and I think we've actually calmed everyone down for a minute there

2720
03:05:26,260 --> 03:05:34,260
I kinda dig that man, reminds me of the whole anchor stuff that he's been doing and of course of the infamous Richard Cheese

2721
03:05:35,260 --> 03:05:40,260
Now let's do one of those only let's do an original because we got stormy weather ahead, my friends

2722
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:45,260
That's right, the ships had seen, we'll have a tough time

2723
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:52,260
There's no one, there's no sun up in the sky

2724
03:05:53,260 --> 03:06:00,260
Tell me whether, since my man and I together

2725
03:06:01,260 --> 03:06:07,260
Keeps raining all the time

2726
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:13,260
Life is there

2727
03:06:14,260 --> 03:06:20,260
And as we everywhere, stormy weather

2728
03:06:21,260 --> 03:06:26,260
Since my man and I together

2729
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:33,260
Keeps raining all the time

2730
03:06:36,260 --> 03:06:41,260
Keeps raining all the time

2731
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:48,260
When he went away, the blues came in and met me

2732
03:06:48,260 --> 03:06:53,260
And if he stays away, oh, I can't hear it

2733
03:06:54,260 --> 03:06:59,260
All I do is pray that all the buzz

2734
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:05,260
Gonna let me walk in the sun once more

2735
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:13,260
And go on, all I had a life is gone

2736
03:07:13,260 --> 03:07:22,260
Stormy weather, since my man and I together

2737
03:07:23,260 --> 03:07:28,260
Keeps raining all the time

2738
03:07:29,260 --> 03:07:38,260
But time, keeps raining all the time

2739
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:50,260
Stormy weather, since my man and I together

2740
03:07:51,260 --> 03:07:56,260
Keeps raining all the time

2741
03:07:57,260 --> 03:08:03,260
Stormy weather, since my man and I together

2742
03:08:03,260 --> 03:08:08,260
Keeps raining all the time

2743
03:08:09,260 --> 03:08:26,260
The time, keeps raining all the time

2744
03:08:26,260 --> 03:08:42,260
Keeps raining all the time

2745
03:08:42,260 --> 03:08:48,260
Stormy weather, since my man and I together

2746
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:53,260
Keeps raining all the time

2747
03:08:54,260 --> 03:08:57,260
Sitting at home with my dick on heart

2748
03:08:58,260 --> 03:09:01,260
So I got the black book for a freak to call

2749
03:09:02,260 --> 03:09:05,260
Picked up the telephone and dialed the seven digits set

2750
03:09:06,260 --> 03:09:09,260
Yo this RC baby, are you down with it

2751
03:09:09,260 --> 03:09:13,260
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door

2752
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:17,260
Not having no idea what the night had in store

2753
03:09:18,260 --> 03:09:21,260

What's wrong baby dog, where the quick one at?

You can say I'm desperate even call me perverted

But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted

2761
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:52,260
Your dad will be disgusted when he sees your pussy

2762
03:09:52,260 --> 03:09:56,260

Or my way to Mars

2809
03:12:42,260 --> 03:12:43,260
On a collision course

2810
03:12:43,260 --> 03:12:45,260
I am a satellite

2811
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:46,260
I'm out of control

2812
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:49,260
I have a sense of human-readed to reload

2813
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:51,260
Lying at a bomb

03:12:51,260 --> 03:12:52,260

Don't want to stop at all

2851
03:14:19,260 --> 03:14:24,260
Did I have to die?

2852
03:14:24,260 --> 03:14:28,260
Did I die?

2853
03:14:28,260 --> 03:14:32,260
Did I die?

2854
03:14:32,260 --> 03:14:39,260
Alright, wait a minute, I need some cowbell.

2855
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:07,260
We've been in our cars, we've planned to start out in the street.

2856
03:15:07,260 --> 03:15:14,260
Though we didn't have much money, we barely made enough to survive.

2857
03:15:14,260 --> 03:15:21,260
But when we got a lot of space, we got baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

2858
03:15:21,260 --> 03:15:22,260
Walk in the land of everybody, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,

2860
03:16:06,260 --> 03:16:14,260
Walk through the wrong thing, everybody is waiting and can't Everything is OK, isn't it alright to buy a new career?

2861
03:16:14,260 --> 03:16:16,140
her music

2862
03:16:16,140 --> 03:16:17,940
I came by

2863
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:19,140

2864
03:16:19,140 --> 03:16:20,700

2865
03:16:20,700 --> 03:16:22,440
life

2866
03:16:37,440 --> 03:16:38,640
Beata

2867
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:42,160
Take it to the space one night

2868
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:45,680
It's more for me to go, but tellin' it all

2869
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:48,400
Suppose I think this man can't decide

2870
03:16:48,400 --> 03:16:52,400
Oh, man, I really can't make a trust

2871
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:55,920
You're gone, gone, right expectations

2872
03:16:55,920 --> 03:17:01,120
Where are you, you wanna cry, you don't need me

2873
03:17:01,120 --> 03:17:05,120
Oh, I get it, I'm running over me

2874
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:07,760
Everybody's waiting at them

2875
03:17:08,720 --> 03:17:14,000
It's a pain in life, let's do the same

2876
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:17,200
It's a pain in life

2877
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:20,240
You know, it's really hard to do that when you only have two arms

2878
03:17:20,240 --> 03:17:24,080
And you've got to, I hold the cowbell, you've got to bang it

2879
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:26,480
The cowbell, it is

2880
03:17:26,480 --> 03:17:28,240
You've got to control the board

2881
03:17:28,240 --> 03:17:29,920
And I've got to have my cigarette

2882
03:17:29,920 --> 03:17:32,480
It's like all three things you're wanted to become very difficult

2883
03:17:32,480 --> 03:17:35,280
Sometimes I move this whistle to the beat, I'm sorry about that
