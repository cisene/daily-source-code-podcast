1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:10,940
It's Wednesday.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,940
It's the source code and good afternoon.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,580
And as you can tell I still haven't fixed my crappy mic problems

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,940
Second or my feedback problems or just a number of technical difficulties

5
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm an Amsterdam right now and hold on now. I have five wires intertwined

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,460
Hold on headphones and microphone cables

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:53,380
I'm at the Amsterdam house which we affectionately called the bunker because well, it's built like a bunker

8
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,300
I guess in fact these houses in Amsterdam we have one on the canal on the Kuytrosfer which is the emperors canal

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,540
When when they catch fire if they catch fire they never burn down

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:11,340
They burn out is what they say what they say in other words the structure always remains just the shit on the inside will

11
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,900
leave these things are built like

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,540
bunkers

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,180
And I had to stay in Amsterdam because of course have been away for two weeks been on vacation hadn't been here and we have

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,940
Patricia's cosmetics company here. I always want to check up on them and my assistant Chris

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She keeps her office here. So hung out with the girls.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I just went through the latest stuff, signing stuff, whatever.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I had dinner with my banker, which is always fun.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you're in good standing with your bank, that is Thardy is her name.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And if you're looking to invest your money in the Benelux, let me know.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let me know, here you'll be more than happy to take care of that for you.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And all other private banking services needed.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That was nice. It was a great evening.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It was about 70 degrees.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And it was just the city. It was beautiful.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So nice warm summer evening. Good food.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Nice wine.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hanging out.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Talkable friends who drop by May or may not know Rodrigo Otazu.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He makes jewelry for great necklaces.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jennifer Aniston's Wornam.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Beyonce. J-Lo. Madonna.

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,500
and my wife. He lives in Amsterdam. I believe he's from Argentina originally. So anyway,

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,380
so I'm going to stay here this evening, which is kind of cool because it gives me an extra

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,100
hour of sleep since Amsterdam is much closer to the studio than Belgium. So I don't have

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,020
to get up until, oh man, 430, can't believe it. Oh, and there was something really nice

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,820
that I wanted to talk about. See, maybe five or six weeks ago, a friend of mine called

37
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,460
an acid. You could use the Amsterdam house as a set for, there was something, I don't

38
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,540
know if it was a new gadget show or a commercial or an infomercial. I'm not quite sure what

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,940
it was. So I said, yeah, no problem. And so they did the shoot. I wasn't here. Crystal

40
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,340
was, of course, my assistant. And today she said, you know, these guys, they said that

41
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,980
they're going to pick this up, but they haven't picked it up. And I figured it's been long

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,940
enough. You might as well just take this upstairs and go play with it. And she clearly knows

43
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,220
me quite well. It is the

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Pinnacle Systems Show Center.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500
And I don't know if you've ever heard of this.

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,200
I haven't even looked at the website yet, but essentially it's a box that looks...

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,480
Well, it has about the dimensions of a DVD player, really thin new DVD player.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
Four lights on the front, that's all.

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,080
It's just one brush metal look front, one with a power switch and there's a power light.

50
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,440
A new media light, oh-ho.

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,240
And something in the middle that does not have a description, so I'm not quite sure what that does.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:11,240
But essentially this box has a Wi-Fi card built in and it knows how to listen to a streaming server.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,740
And we'll display that with a nice menuing system on your television.

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,340
So this is really something that I'm interested in, well more for the experience than technology.

55
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,640
Because technology is probably crap and we'll find out about that as I get into it probably this weekend.

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Just with the experience of having BitTorrent download automatically and

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,480
And then I guess the way this works is you can set it up.

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,840
So if you drop new content into a specified folder on a PC, which of course needs to be

59
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,440
connected to your home network as well, then this box will recognize it and the new media

60
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,080
light will flash and then you can get into the menuing system.

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,320
You can play the new content.

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,900
So this would be great for the American TV shows that I record and then just much better

63
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
interface.

64
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,820
Although I do have my doubts, first of all, I need a PC to make this work because it needs

65
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:10,400
to start up a database which manages your content and a streaming server to send the

66
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:19,300
content from PC over the home network to the show center media player.

67
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,580
So okay, problem one is a PC.

68
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,620
I actually just loaded the software on my virtual PC on my Mac.

69
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,740
It appears to work, but I really have to go to bed pretty soon, so I won't be able to

70
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,660
play with that tonight.

71
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
uh...

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,440
but I'll have to get a dedicated PC setup for that.

73
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,280
So that's problem one.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,720
And then of course, the streaming server business, you know, what exactly is it?

75
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Is it media streaming?

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,280
Is it windows, media, windows, media streaming server?

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
Is it a proprietary streaming server?

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,600
That's all very unclear, but it does play.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,200
Divx, exvid, MPEG 1 and 2 and MP3.

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
So that should work.

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,280
So I'm pretty excited about that.

82
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm going to play without this weekend, get it installed.

83
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,800
And I will certainly report back on that.

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,040
OK, let me slip the headphones on for a second because every source code

85
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,400
needs an inspirational moment of the day, which means we're going to play some tunes.

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,640
And I've got something selected for you from the voice.

87
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,280
Ella Fitzgerald.

88
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Thanks for watching.

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,920

Go guys, have a good one.

Good way. What's wrong? He missed me.

101

She has one of the classic voices.

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,900
Ella Fitzgerald on the source code for today.

108
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,500
And before I go, I just wanted to wrap up by mentioning the audiobook that I've been

109
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,940
listening to, timeline by Michael Priton, the unabridged version, which I bought from

110
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,220
through audible.com.

111
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,940
Fabulous book.

112
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Absolutely amazing.

113
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,580
I'm so enthralled in this thing.

114
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,380
And the audiobook version is just phenomenal.

115
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,140
Speaker is so good.

116
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
I've not mentioned it before.

117
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
It does the accent so well.

118
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,420
And the story is plausible, man.

119
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,300
I'm not into dragons and dungeons and medieval times, et cetera.

120
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,700
And the story does take you there through quantum travel.

121
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,300
But wow, what an excellent book.

122
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,900
I totally recommend it.

123
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,380
And I was actually wondering about that.

124
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,900
What if I decided, well, I really like this book so much, I'm going to put it on an RSS

125
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,340
feed for distribution.

126
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
And here's the question.

127
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,980
Of course you won't be able to...

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,960
play it since it's an AAC file that AAC or AAC whatever Apple's DRM stuff is. So you won't be able

129
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,040
to play it but is there an interface that if I give you that file I give you this audio file

130
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,480
that you can then purchase it wouldn't that be great if you fired it up and iTunes and iTunes

131
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,120
said oh I see you want to play this but it's registered to Adam Curry would you like to buy it

132
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,920
and just click yes and the purchase is done. Now that would make a lot of sense. I wonder if

133
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,800
they've got it set up that way I doubt it. Food for thought at least and I'm going to end the source

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,640
code today with that thought. Not much blogging time today so I'll have to catch up tomorrow

135
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,520
and look forward to it. So have yourself a great day, what's rest of it or a great evening or wherever

136
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,800
you are. Kindness yeah it's so different everywhere. I'll definitely be on tomorrow so take care

137
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,240
everybody and I'll see you. Bye-bye.
