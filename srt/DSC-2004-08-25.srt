00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Once again it's time for the source code. It is Wednesday, on the month of August 25th,

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,620
2004. Good afternoon, good evening, good morning wherever you are. I'm Adam Curry. Welcome to

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:29,340
my daily brain dump which hopefully showed up on your iPod or the MP3 device automatically

4
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,340
this morning. It's Wednesday afternoon here and Wednesday still is a tough day. It's the

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,620
middle of the week and again the alarm clock went off at 3.30 this morning and I'm feeling

6
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,380
pretty worn down but we're getting closer to the end of that. I want to talk about a

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,860
couple things today mainly about what these audio blog posts or audio shows should be.

8
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,740
This morning though when I got up Dave slushers getting closures.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,720
Pearl script had nicely deposited a brand new IT conversations on my iPod

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,080
And I was extremely happy to see that it was an hour and two minutes because my commute is about an hour and six minutes

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,920
And it was IT conversations very on Oprah Hallie suit

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,840
With the second installment of her trip down memory lane the show is called memory lane

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,480
The first one was with Joey Ito and this time she interviewed Dan Bricklin who is the

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,800
The founding father of the spreadsheet Busy Cal for those of you who remember

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,640
And it was again a great great show, you know, you just listen to you know to lots of computer

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,840
science and technology history and

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,000
Events that took place that I recognize I remember a lot of them

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,760
Which is nice. It's it's funny to hear how they do that, you know, I think she

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,920
Because of her very personal approach. I think she gets a lot more out of

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,660
people like Dan, then someone else might.

21
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,500
I don't know.

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,980
I've done that again.

23
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,380
But it's certainly worth mentioning, good show.

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,780
And then I did say that it was an hour and two minutes.

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,980
I was really happy about that.

26
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,500
And that immediately got me to thinking about,

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,620
well, what is the ideal length for one of these shows?

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,820
Of course, depending on how people are going to use it,

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,420
I presume that some will perfectly

30
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,500
find being three or four or five hours long.

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,620
But I'm just supposing here that a lot of people

32
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,860
listen to these during a commute either in the morning

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,620
or in the afternoon and sitting in your car,

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,900
you're on the train, the bus, bike, whatever.

35
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,620
So I think that they should probably be, well,

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,940
if it's a set show, maybe with a topic for every episode,

37
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,780
it could easily be half an hour or an hour,

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,740
so you could split it up.

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm trying to keep mine to 15 minutes,

40
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,900
because, well, I figured if I'm boring myself,

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,820
I must be boring the tears out of you,

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,460
which is also an interesting number.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,460
As Andy Warhol once said, 15 minutes.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,300
15 minutes of fame. Maybe these things are supposed to be about 15 minutes. One that

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:19,600
is much shorter but showed up a nice spoof of me, courtesy of Steve Garfield. Now Steve

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,200
has done some video blogging experiments most recently from the Democratic National

47
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,320
Convention. He's really getting his chops down on editing, putting his own stuff together.

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,400
He found some video blog software. I linked to it on my web blog. You should check it

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,160
out because I'm quite impressed with the software. You register, you log in. It says,

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,100
can we connect to your webcam? Well, it did not mine. I'm on a Mac, so I presume that

51
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,520
may have something to do with it. But no configuration. You just hit record and then you can record

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,960
your video. It stores it on their server. Really nice.

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,440
And so Steve, I guess he's a jokester because he did a spoof on the Daily Source code and

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,480
he did a video version of it, a video message. So I'll play the audio from the

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
that for you.

56
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Okay.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,780
Hello and welcome to the Daily Source Code.

58
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,740
Hi, I'm Eddie Adam Curry Castle here in Belgium because some people here, you know, we're

59
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
only $50,000 close to someone.

60
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,580
So I hope that really goes through.

61
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,820
Hang on a second.

62
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
We got dogs here and everything.

63
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
You know, it's crazy.

64
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
There's lots of animals here.

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
There's the phone.

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
And my wife's coming in.

67
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,820
She wants to talk to me.

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Some believable show.

69
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,820
She always wants to talk to me.

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,820
She knows I'm trying to do this.

71
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,820
I'm not making any money.

72
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
That's why she's mad.

73
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Okay.

74
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
So that's the Daily Source Code for today.

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,660
We'll see you again tomorrow.

76
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,900
As far as I could tell, I did that without a script.

77
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,220
I thought that was pretty good.

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,740
And it's true though, you know, this is...

79
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,660
Hello and welcome to the Daily Source Code.

80
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,460
Hi, I'm Eddie Adam Curry, welcome here in Belgium.

81
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,660
We don't want that to be looping around.

82
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,460
Okay.

83
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,620
He's right that there's, you know, I feel like I'm pretty crazy, you know, doing this

84
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,300
stuff, trying to figure it out, trying to get people to transfer stuff automatically

85
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
onto their iPod.

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,100
But I know there's got to be something there of if now I'm already being spooked by Steve

87
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,300
Garfield then you know you're hitting the big time but I do think that

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,080
Writing is one thing on web blogs when it comes to being able to communicate through

89
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,040
audio and video.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,120
Doing this stuff takes practice.

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,080
They call it the recording arts and sciences.

92
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,360
There's stuff to be learned to do it.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
There's software that isn't necessarily very user friendly.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,920
There's a pretty steep learning curve in the beginning.

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,440
I think that there will be a market though.

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Maybe it's audiobooks.

97
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,400
Maybe it's audio blogs.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
As I'm sure there will be a video market.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,960
Once we start to make it a little bit easier to receive stuff, to get it onto your player,

100
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,320
your play or whatever your play out device is.

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,360
I think that the download platform is a lot more interesting because we can get a lot

102
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
higher quality.

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,160
You don't have to sit around waiting for stuff.

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,640
It just kind of shows up.

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,720
Yeah, it's not a video on demand.

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
It's not immediate.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,560
It's a video by subscription or audio by subscription.

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,520
That's why I was talking about audiobooks, which I like.

109
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
I know I've mentioned it before.

110
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,620
I listened to a lot of them, particularly because I've been in the car a lot in the

111
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,420
past year.

112
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,020
And Dave Weiner, I tried to talk to him today.

113
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,820
He's traveling on his way to Seattle.

114
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,220
He's going to be on the road for another week and he's blogging from the road.

115
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,740
You can see it on scripting.com.

116
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,300
And he had sent me a note that he had listened to my source code and he said, well, thanks

117
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
for the recommendation.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,900
I subscribed, signed up with audible.com.

119
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,980
And I also downloaded the book that you would suggest, which is timeline by Michael Criton,

120
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,660
which is 14 hours worth of MP3 audio.

121
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,700
But I thought it was very entertaining.

122
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Dave hated it and he's been in the car and he's been playing this for...

123
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
He said it was almost done.

124
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,740
He's listened more than 13 hours of the book that he hates.

125
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,860
So, it may not be the best guy to refer audio books to you.

126
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,860
But then I thought for a second, you know...

127
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,820
Cute, no one's reviewing audio books.

128
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
Maybe there's something there.

129
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,020
Oprah certainly did okay with Oprah's book club.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,280
And since I've already listened to so many of them, what the heck I'll try and review

131
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,320
now and then.

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:27,380
So for instance today, what we have, I've been listening to a book called Anti-Americanism

133
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,000
by French author Jean-Francois de Vérez.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
They did that accent, huh?

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,280
Of course it's been translated.

136
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,320
Apparently he wrote another book called Without Marks or Jesus, which apparently was

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
a bestseller.

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:49,120
Unfortunately, I don't know anything about it nor is it available on Audible.

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,320
Just go to the blurb here, what they give you about the book Anti-Americanism.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,640
Just taking a moment here.

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,280
Of course, lots of heavy processing going on in the community.

142
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
There we go.

143
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Of course, now it's out here it comes.

144
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Hold on.

145
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
So there's two...

146
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
We're sorry.

147
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
We've encountered an assistant error on your browser.

148
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
It was less idle and lost connection with audible.com.

149
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Oh, thanks.

150
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
So, I guess I can't plug in your beautiful writing there.

151
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Okay.

152
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,500
So this book was also quite controversial because it discusses anti-Americanism.

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
It's written by a French guy.

154
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
And he basically says, bullshit.

155
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
You know, all of this stuff about all these...

156
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
There are so many myths about America that someone has to say it.

157
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
And by the way, we as Europeans might want to look at ourselves once in a while

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,500
before we start pointing the finger overseas at the hyper superpower called the United States of America.

159
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
A couple things about audiobooks.

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
So, you know, one, there's just the story and the book and whatever you're going to listen to.

161
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Then, of course, there's the reader, how the reader, you know, communicates the words.

162
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
And there's also the quality.

163
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,000
the quality.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,300
And in this is a prime example of, I think, a reader that just doesn't put everything into it that he could,

165
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,480
or he sounds a little bit too technical, it's very dry.

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,600
I think he reads just a tad too fast.

167
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
And the quality really, really bites ass.

168
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
But I want you to listen to a little bit of it.

169
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
So you get a feel for this book.

170
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,100
His title is a little bit written by a French guy.

171
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Well, it's actually none of that.

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,500
So listen to this from John F. Montsseauchauve.

173
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,580
you

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,320
We deceive ourselves if we think we can negotiate with the al-Qaeda fanatics and their ilk.

175
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,000
For this course to have the remotest chance of success, their motivations would have to

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
be logical.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,480
As it is, an abyss separates them from any rational course of action, and terrorism is

178
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,800
the parody of policy that serves to fill it.

179
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,880
you

180
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,780
The days that immediately followed the unleashing of the full Islamo-terrorist war against

181
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,820
democracy in general and the United States in particular turned out to be an extremely

182
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,260
interesting and revealing testing ground.

183
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,620
Since over a period of two months the phobias and fallacies of traditional anti-Americanism

184
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,340
and of neo-totalitarianism massively intensified.

185
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,900
The clumsiest of these fallacies was an attempt to justify Islamist terrorism by claiming

186
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,340
that America has long been hostile towards Islam.

187
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,060
But the truth is that the United States' actions historically have been far less damaging to

188
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,980
Muslim interests than the actions of Britain, France or Russia.

189
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,980
These European powers have conquered Muslim countries, occupied and indeed oppressed

190
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,420
them over decades and even centuries.

191
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,380
Americans on the other hand have never colonized a Muslim nation.

192
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,140
Americans' events know hostility towards Islam as such today.

193
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,020
the contrary their interventions in Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo as well as the pressure

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,280
exerted on the Macedonian government were designed to defend most of minorities.

195
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,720
I've been listening to this book for the past couple of days. I think it's about

196
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,800
six hours worth of five and a half hours worth of audio. It's really hard to concentrate.

197
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,400
You heard the speaker. It's just not a nice voice at all and sounds very nasal. I should

198
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,600
take that back to Audible and tell them they should get it redone. You do pick up a lot of things.

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:48,160
It's all of the books. I'll try to do one a day as long as the supply lasts. For all the books

200
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,440
that are about the Bush Bin Laden connection and 9-11 conspiracies. I listened to a lot of those.

201
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,840
This one definitely gives you a whole different perspective. Even some common

202
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,640
myths or some common beliefs that I've never really stopped to think about really are quite mythical.

203
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:15,540
If you do, if different facts or different angles perspective is shown to you, which this book does.

204
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:22,300
One more thing I had for us today.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:37,000
was second this was a some note that I'd made myself taxes once you got the audio software running that everything just anything any other application you bring to the foreground starts to hurt.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:50,500
I want to talk about the in a parent were the are bought g are that is spreading the internet at least it's getting a lot of a lot of attention a lot of stories about this.

207
00:12:50,500 --> 00:13:05,500
So this were was distributed open to the back door and essentially enables the distributor of the were to activate your webcam and look at you and spy in on you or whatever the webcam is pointed at.

208
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,500
And it's like everyone's acting like this is a bad thing I think this is great this should be a feature and built into every single computer.

209
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:19,500
In fact would it be nice if we actually did have a compatible video conferencing system this guy apparently has it all figured out whoever has done this were because.

210
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,500
He can check on all our webcam so you know I think this needs to be explored from a whole different angle and.

211
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,460
And quite frankly, I wouldn't mind looking at someone else's webcam.

212
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,060
If we could connect, I wouldn't mind checking out my neighbors.

213
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,300
And maybe I'd even have some PayPal cash.

214
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,100
It left in my bank account to do that.

215
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,860
Grum Song of the Day.

216
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:50,620
A song that has been performed by many famous singers throughout the years.

217
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,700
This is one of, if not the original, I believe it's from 1936.

218
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,180
This is La Vianvosa, since we were kind of in a French vibe, brought to you by the perfectly

219
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,500
German Marlena Dietrich.

220
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,500
And I'm not going to be a fan of it.

221
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm not going to be a fan of it.

222
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I'm not going to be a fan of it.

223
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm not going to be a fan of it.

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They're more than two-lors, they're some fake elkersos, they're here at the trade of mocha, in a part of the wonder, Dorja Conne la Cósé.

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Tell me, for one more, for L'Héléville, la vie.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
L'Hélé, l'Hélé.

227

L'Héléville, l'Hélé.

228

De que chou la péos ones.

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
A la justo some one, mocha, ke vie.

230
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm going to say it's my fault.

231
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm going to say it's my fault.

232
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm going to say it's my fault.

233
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm going to say it's my fault.

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,480
Go, feel upon us, everyone, hear upon the two minds.

235
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:48,660
No one ever knows, be on the road, and be on the road.

236
00:15:48,660 --> 00:16:08,540
We'll be on the road, we'll be on the road.

Yeah, take that Steve Garfield dot com.

240

Okay, I see that I've gone over my allotted 15 minutes, a little bit on the long side today.

So, we're going to sign off and tomorrow, well we'll see what tomorrow brings.
