00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is Eric from AirCris.com and you're listening to the daily source code with Adam Curry.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey how about that for us?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If he started, everybody whoops, welcome to the daily source code.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm Adam Curry.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It is October 13th. It's a Wednesday, 2004.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And once again, we're bringing you the best Belgium has to offer.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How are you?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm coming to you from Curry Castle in Flanders, Belgium.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's been another busy morning. I've been working on the directory.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I potted out org man, there's so many podcasts coming out.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's see in this show today, we'll be going through some usual comedy stuff.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll be talking about OPML directories, which is something that even if you aren't

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
non-a-geek and not a nerd and not a technology, you'll really like because we've got about six

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
non-nurdy, non-GET people working with this right now.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you're in the information and linking, then this is completely for you.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So stay tuned for that.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We also have a couple of bits from Koma 1000, who of course are podcasting all of

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
there or not all of a lot of their news items.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's see a new podcast that we're going to talk about.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Also Chris Perillo about the whole terminology podcasting.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And of course, just a little bit of political stuff.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And also backed by very popular demand and requests.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not going to tell you what it was.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you remember me playing it on the source code, I've got another one by Durewood

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do-Shay for you.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Stay tuned for that.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000

You turned Ram Jam into a big, one hit wonder.

171
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's actually a lead belly original.

172
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I found out just recently.

173
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was going to play that for you.

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,160
play that for you. I had it stored somewhere in a playlist, almost like, let me move

175
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:14,400
my phone a little bit. There we go. Oops. Sorry. Now, alright. Okay, that should sound

176
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,240
a bit better. Yeah, I had a, I had led Billy actually performing that. If you don't know

177
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,280
who led Billy is, I first heard about him on one of those rock and roll hall-of-famed

178
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:32,340
dinners where, you know, all the running stones and, you know, feel specter and, and the

179
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,920
kings and Bruce Springsteen and there's all these rock and roll grades come to honor each other

180
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,520
and they're all wearing tuxedos. It was really funny. And it's $1,000 or played dinner

181
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,560
if you can get in and, and all these guys like Keith Richards and Ron Wood and all the, you know,

182
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,000
little Steven and all these guitar grades would all say, you know, led Billy really turned

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,200
me on to rock and roll and was all led Billy's influence. That's just really old, I'm sure

184
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,400
he's, he doesn't. He's not alive anymore, I'm sure, but of course he was inducted into the rock

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,000
hall of fame and I actually came across a track of him singing Black Betty. It sounded very

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
different, but you, you know, just, you'd never think that that would later become, it was

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,560
a pretty big hit in the 70s. Okay, so this is your daily source code. Well, let me just

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,840
reset everything there. Okay, using this sound flower plug-in so I can monitor my own voice

189
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,520
and sometimes it, it, the buffer kind of overstreams or something or gets filled up and then

190
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,600
I start to hear myself with the delay in the headphones, not very cool. Something I didn't

191
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,880
talk about on previous source codes, of course, yesterday wasn't a source code. I had everything

192
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,520
all cut up and I saw the Dave was awake at like five a.m. Seattle time and I was just about

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,720
ready to record, I said, well dude, why don't we just, you know, we hadn't spoken a couple of days.

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,480
So why don't we just do our rap and we'll record a show and then we had an opening of a new

195
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,880
grandmaster view store about 45 minutes drive and I had to be there on seven, shut up around

196
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,960
730 because I had to eat and you know, so I just didn't really have time to do a source code

197
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,120
release, there was some audio that went out yesterday. So I didn't get to talk about Christopher

198
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,400
Reeve passing away and this is sad, you know, when you think about, it was 1995 when he fell off

199
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,960
his horse. A grant he was doing some pretty high like steeple chase height jumping and that

200
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,560
put him in the hospital and made him quadriplegic and he's been a big proponent of stem cell

201
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:45,680
research because there certainly is hope that the condition that he had, that there was some help for

202
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,240
that or some fix for that if we can do more research, well, you probably know all about that debate.

203
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,200
And then all of a sudden, man, it's just like boom, you know, you read and actually the newspaper

204
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,000
has always been printed here. So it didn't really hit the newspapers here. It was at Monday because

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,360
he died Sunday night and the papers here had already printed from Monday, but it saw it online around

206
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,640
eight o'clock in the morning and it was like, wow, you know, and he had a heart attack and slips

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,880
into a coma, it's just sucks. So, but of course, you can trust the web to, you know, to be thinking

208
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,840
about about Christopher Reeve and, you know, just, whereas I used to look maybe five, six years ago,

209
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,280
I used to look in the morning at my email inbox and say, you know, what goodies has it brought

210
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,400
for me today? These days I go to my playlist in iTunes or on my iPod and to see what goodies

211
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,680
the web has brought for me and this is one that showed up.

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,960
Christopher Reeve, definitely this superman of my generation. All right, looking at some email

213
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,960
sent to the daily source code, by the way, I'm printing these out now because my screen is so full

214
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,840
with player windows and all this stuff that I have queued up for you and I don't want to run

215
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,920
as few applications as possible to make sure that we don't get any skipping in the recording.

216
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,320
This is from Benjamin Walker, he says he, you know, he likes listening to the source code.

217
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,800
This is a public radio producer in Boston, just started a new show called The Theory of Everything,

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,000
which also airs in San Francisco on KL, KALW and also also work for the Berkman Center,

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,920
which is Harvard Law and Creative Commons. Now he said, he said, I figured out the podcast

220
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,160
and thing all of my own, the enclosure part was easy. The changing the dot RDF to the dot XML part

221
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,680
was very, very hard because all you smart folks have forgotten that there are clueless people

222
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,080
like me out there and all the how-to sites left this out because it was obvious or something.

223
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,560
Yes. And believe me, Benjamin, there are lots of geeks who do this stuff who are listening

224
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,560
and everyone's trying to do better. So it goes on to him so excited about the invention,

225
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,520
cannot tell him which is who will mean the next generation of pub. Oh, this is actually,

226
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,160
I shouldn't mumble over this. I'm actually all caps. I am so excited about your invention.

227
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I cannot tell you how much this tool will mean to the next generation of public radio producers

228
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,760
who want to find a way to connect with listeners without being tethered to the out-of-touch stations

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,520
themselves. Excellent. Excellent. And we already have morning stories from MPR Tony Khan,

230
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,560
which is already officially sanctioned as up and running as a podcast. So here he has a question.

231
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,040
I got myself a 20 gig a month web hosting plan at the beginning of the month. I figured it would

232
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,480
be more than enough. Of course, he's already started his podcast, which you can find in the iPod

233
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,720
podcast directory. Yesterday, he says, the traffic was already at 7 gigs. Today, it's up to 14.

234
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm wondering if the podcast in community is growing this fast or if it's a matter of people

235
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,160
trying out the different software and doubting the downloading the same stuff repeatedly.

236
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,360
I only have 45 megs up total right now. Don't want to piss off my new hosting provider in the

237
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,520
first month. Thanks for your time. Benjamin Walker. Benjamin, you hit on something that happened to me

238
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,640
yesterday as well. I was just about to hop on the phone with a couple of people actually a

239
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:34,400
Doug K from IT conversations. When I got a call from the CEO of, I think it's either

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,520
Tiskly, the Netherlands or Tiskly Europe. It could be Tiskly Europe. He was a Dutchman no matter what.

241
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,440
Now, I got to go back a little bit in history. Two years ago, I sold a hosting company that

242
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,840
had called the Data Barn. Because early in 2000, all this ban, all these bandwidth stories were

243
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,120
running about and there was money to be made. Of course, a lot of that was double accounting

244
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,840
turns out in the long run. But really after the bubble burst, there was just no one looking

245
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,880
for, you know, rack space and floor space and the right peering and connections.

246
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
So I'd by then acquired, and my partner's also started to flake out. So I'd acquired all

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,240
their shares and then I sold the whole company to the employees and to management. And as a

248
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,040
part of the deal, I said, well, I want to have my rack in the facility and hosting and I don't

249
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,280
need much service and maybe a reboot now and then. But ban with just, you know, that's just

250
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,400
for me. Whatever I'm using and we agreed, I think we actually put in writing that I, you know,

251
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,840
I wouldn't start a porn site or something like that. Well, yesterday, I got a call from the CEO.

252
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,200
It was a new CEO because they acquired the company, data barn and cap cave actually.

253
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,880
Tiskly acquired them probably about a year ago. And so there was a, you know, a grandfather

254
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,240
agreement and I'd never met this guy. I think there was even a CEO before him or general manager

255
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,880
of God knows what. And he said, hey, Adam, you know, I do and I'm like to introduce myself.

256
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,160
He was really nice and I knew what was coming and he said, you know, I'm looking at your

257
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,560
bandwidth, you know, mass what you're doing. And I said, well, what he means is, well, you're pushing

258
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:21,520
35 megabits per second continuously, continuous traffic, 35 megabits. And he says, and our other

259
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,000
customers are complaining because, you know, they, people, their sites are slowing down because

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,600
you're kind of filling up the entire pipe. And I know where their other customers are and I know

261
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,920
who complain because they have the national state lottery of the Netherlands and U2 with the U2.com,

262
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
all their multimedia. So I thought, you know, I'm already laughing like, all right, my little podcast

263
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:50,000
is disturbing the multimedia of U2. So I, I said, well, you know, actually I had already anticipated

264
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,400
you calling and I really glad you did. And as you probably noticed, I've already started moving

265
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,280
stuff over to a dot market count because it's, you know, I looked at my own stats and per day,

266
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,320
so just want to compare apples to apples here. Benjamin is now shipping what he says, 7, 7 gigs

267
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,800
on the first day. So doing about 7 gigs a day, which is actually quite a lot. Also he has a good podcast.

268
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,080
It's also the length is, you know, everything counts, right? Every bit counts, every encoding bit you

269
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,480
have at a higher setting, at the file size, and all of that's going to count in these totals.

270
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:32,480
But I'm shipping out close to 40 gigabytes of data per day, 40 gigs of data.

271
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,200
And so he said, well, you know, I'm looking at, you know, previous agreements, I don't

272
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,040
quite understand what the deal was inside random through it quickly. And I said, but you know what,

273
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,200
I said, you know, it's my understanding having come from the hosting business and having started

274
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:56,240
that and done a lot of these peering agreements, is that there can be a benefit to top tier

275
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:04,880
providers to having all the flow coming from one place, namely from them, because, and there are

276
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,960
other people who can almost suck them. So we set my buffer. There are other people who can explain

277
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,640
this much better than I can. But at these network access points or maps, you may have heard of

278
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,040
May East or May West or the, we have the M6, the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. That's where all these

279
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,560
big ISPs come together, and they hand off traffic to each other, and they do it under appearing

280
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,560
agreement. And it's kind of exactly what it sounds like, you know, we're peers. And so I'm going to

281
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,000
ship you like a million gigs of data this month, and you're going to be shipping a million

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,320
gigs of data to me. So it's a wash, right? And we're peers and don't worry about it.

283
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,960
And so there's no money that actually changes hand. Now, if you don't have a peering agreement

284
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,720
with the big telco provider, you have to buy transit, which means you have to buy that bandwidth

285
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,200
from some other provider who's closer to that particular pipe that you want to be to. So if someone

286
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,600
wants to get the daily source code, and they're on a provider, particularly in the United States,

287
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,600
that can't get to me directly by peering because you're on, you know, a subnet of something,

288
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,000
you know, this is where it starts to break down my explanation. But your provider will actually

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,880
have to buy that transit to help you suck that stuff down, which is why a lot of ISPs use

290
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,160
caching technology. So that means that there's an unbalanced and imbalance, and that power can be

291
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,280
created by having all the demand for particular content coming from one particular area, from one particular

292
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,320
network. That's kind of my lame and explanation. If anyone out there who's listening to the source

293
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,520
code can explain this, please record our an MP3 and send it my way because I think that's the way it is.

294
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,320
And if it is that way, then that could be very advantageous. Anyway, this guy took the bait immediately,

295
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,200
he said, yeah, we should talk about all that. So there must be something there, right? If not just for PR,

296
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,920
for public relations reasons. So I'm going to meet up with him next Thursday. But clearly,

297
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,520
this is going to be a problem. We know Bitcoin is definitely a part of this solution,

298
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,480
but we're thinking about it. So you're not alone. But what I've been doing and this is what I would

299
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,680
recommend for the time being is getting a dot mac account if you're on a Mac. There's all kinds of

300
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:28,160
free accounts. Accounts you can get that include storage and bandwidth. You know, you just kind of

301
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,320
have to spread the load a little bit. And the way I see everything going, people who have the

302
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,520
type of traffic that we're talking about will pretty soon will be able to, you know, make some

303
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,400
kind of deals so that you can get compensated. The first thing I'm going to lay down in front of this

304
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,000
guy next week is, hey, why do you sponsor the daily source code with bandwidth? That's, you know,

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,120
because of course, they probably throttle me down to about two megabits per second now,

306
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,280
which, you know, if you're using iPod, you're still going to get the files,

307
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,800
just going to take longer to bring them in. And as I said, I'm spreading it around to other

308
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,560
other hosting locations. But that makes so much sense, you know, and then we'll find out if they

309
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,320
really is a benefit for them, because he's not going to be giving away something, you know,

310
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,160
for just a handful of thousand people to listen to. So we'll see, I will report back on that.

311
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,760
Okay, it's the source code. What do we add? Wednesday, October 13th, middle of the week,

312
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,080
hump day time for some raster web jokio.

313
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:43,040
Welcome to raster web jokio for today. Hey, what's the deal with podcast? I mean, you're not

314
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,720
casting pods, right? Hey, what's up with that? You suck! Thank you, thank you, good night. I'm here all

315
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,920
week. Thank you Pete. I hope that brighten up your day like it did mine. Whenever I see a raster web

316
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,360
and it's like 30 seconds, I know it's going to be funny. So the first time you're playing,

317
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,520
it's always the best. We talked yesterday on the combined trade secret daily source code about

318
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,080
the opml directory. Don't roll your eyes in your hand right away, because I think if you like

319
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:19,280
web logs, you'll really like what opml directories are all about. So on ipod.org, I started

320
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,800
a directory of podcasts. Now creating a directory, if you're seeing the demos or if you're seeing

321
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,040
Yahoo's directory, and we talked about this, Dave and I talked about it yesterday on the source

322
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,040
secrets. Let's call it that the combined show. There's a lot of politics and what's the top level,

323
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,400
what are the top categories? And the great thing about the opml directory is that everybody can

324
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,680
be the top level. It's just like a web log. There's no top level to the internet, to the web.

325
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Anyone can have a top level. I'm sure I want you to see ipod.org as a top level, but if you don't

326
00:20:51,760 --> 00:21:00,000
like it, you can just follow the tree and connect, I'm sorry, you can follow the tree down

327
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,880
to something you do like and you can put that into your own top level and you can be the top level.

328
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,920
Let's all copy paste stuff because it's done in outlines. If you're never using the outline

329
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,960
or go to outliners.org and look at and see what the history of outlines, you've probably done

330
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,600
outlinings in school. At least if you're educated in the states in Europe, they don't,

331
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,800
they've never taught the concept of outlining at all, which is amazing to me. Or at least not that

332
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,480
I've found in my European education. And so it's real simple. You have, you know, the outline is

333
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,840
just like the directory. And if you want to create a new category or subcategory, you just

334
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,040
tab the next node underneath that. And you can collapse stuff. So it's easy to organize. It is easy

335
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,760
to keep track of it. And if you want to point off sight off of your directory, just like you

336
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,280
would a link with a weblog, then you do exactly that except it's not a dot HTML link you're

337
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,320
pointing to. It's a dot OPML link, which stands for outline processor markup language, just like HTML,

338
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,040
hypertext markup language. And what's cool is so now we have six different categories on the

339
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,240
ipodder.org podcast directory, which are handled by other people. And if you look at the music

340
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,960
directory, the minute you click on the music directory, you'll see that the owner of that link of

341
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,360
that node is someone else. It's not me. And if you click on the suggest the link, the email is going

342
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,720
to go to that person. Now under that, you'll see a category mixes. And you'll see the mix of the

343
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,000
week. And you'll see, so that's maintained by yet someone else who's also just basically posting

344
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,240
an OPML document on a web server, just like you would an HTML document. So the whole thing kind of

345
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,840
flows together, and you can traverse it left and right. And if you want to know more about that,

346
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,240
then definitely listen to yesterday's daily source code, because they've given a very good

347
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,400
explanation about the power of what this could be. And once we get the search engine guys in, then

348
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,960
life will be beautiful. And I do believe that. I came across Port-Lets podcast today, the fifth

349
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,440
in the series so far. Port-Let is one of the contributors to the OPML directory. So I thought

350
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,240
maybe we let it better to let him talk about how it's working. Then me, because it's just right

351
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,080
me promoting shit that I'm doing. So please listen to what else. One of the things I think is

352
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,880
more really interesting that's going long is now there's a the director of podcasts come along

353
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:30,080
and I'm taking part in that. And I'll be managing a couple of lists. I decided that I'd like to see

354
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,720
more comedy. And I'd like to see more interviews stuff out there. So I'm taking part myself to help out.

355
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:47,440
And submitted my suggestions for subcategories to Adam Curry, the guy that's run in the

356
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:58,000
ipotter.org list. And you can find it if you go to www.ipotter.org. And then look on the left hand

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,120
column. You'll see if you haven't seen the site before. Just look on the left hand column. For those

358
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,280
of you who've been there before, you'll actually notice it's got a new design. Look for the directory,

359
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,000
click on that button. And then look for the categories. And you'll see not just comedy and humor

360
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,280
and interviews, but you'll see if quite a few other categories and you'll see the directories growing.

361
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:26,000
And it is filling up. There's still way more empty categories I think than there are actually

362
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,440
shows. But it's easy to contribute. So especially, one mind, if you've got something out there

363
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,320
that's funny, or you've got some interviews of something the podcast you want to do. Just submit it.

364
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,040
Go the ipotters.org site. Look for the directory link. If you have a feed, just look for the

365
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,080
Submit link. And if it's classified as comedy or if it's an interview, I'll get the listing.

366
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,640
And I'll be able to update my list. It doesn't have to be those categories. There's other ones

367
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,720
there like food and technology and stuff like that. And when you submit your site, your feed,

368
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,320
whoever's running that list will be able to update the list. Some of the categories I've got started in

369
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:20,480
comedy thing is, let's give you more or less my topic. Tonight, I've got sketch, song,

370
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:30,480
parody, political, satire, commentary, current events, the absurd, the last category. I just thought

371
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:38,000
kind of, I hate the word miscellaneous. Okay, so you see how people can really get involved in

372
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,000
maintaining their category. I mean, and you're a part of the whole system. So if you want,

373
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
if you're interested, or you want to find out more about contributing to the ipotter.org podcast

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,640
directory, it's completely open. Go to ipotter.org, go to the podcast directory, and there's

375
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,800
a sub directory there that's titled contribute. Yeah, we thought about this stuff. Okay,

376
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,040
here's a bit from Koma 1000. I picked up on the podcast that I like the one to share with you.

377
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,040
It's really so incredible. It's hard to explain. DDPR, saying Torx songs and jazz clubs in St. Louis and

378
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,640
Chicago using stage names like Little Girl Blue and Laurie Allen. But it was her voice that

379
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,920
captivated a record producer in the 50s and convinced her to record 12 songs. The company went

380
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,720
to the point, as soon as it was recorded, obviously, and I thought it was totally lost.

381
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,920
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne. After the company shut down,

382
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,040
Pierce went on with her own life, raising two daughters and marrying, while the songs which

383
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,640
were never published were forgotten by just about everyone. But some research on the internet

384
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,080
unearthed them owned by a small record label that specialized in obscure recording. He's

385
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,240
was delighted to put the bits and pieces back together and here it is. It's a dream come true,

386
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,440
although I feel like I'm standing here in my fuzzy slippers.

387
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,200
Pierce is now expecting to hear of her work from 1957, will be nominated for a Grammy.

388
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,760
And after decades of suspense, she's willing to wait a little more. It's like going back

389
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,000
and being a ghost at your own past. It's really been incredible. So I have one foot in 1957 and

390
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:33,200
one in 2004. John Rapp, coma, 1000 news. Isn't that a great story? Isn't the internet great?

391
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,480
Isn't the web great? We can find that stuff. Well, we'll see what happens with the upcoming Grammy

392
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,640
awards. I'm going to kind of mix it up today, a little bit of podcast stuff, a little bit of political

393
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,480
stuff, a little bit of music still on the way. This is, I wanted to play this just the intro

394
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,720
of this podcast for you because a lot of people are talking about, well, what's in the show? Do I really

395
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,040
want to listen to the whole thing? You kind of should just treat it like radio. You know,

396
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,000
use that away from the station if you're bored. And that's what those of us that are making these

397
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,520
shows are going to have to realize that if you're boring, people are going to zap to the next show,

398
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,760
maybe fast forward through your show. And it works that could unsubscribe from the feed. So there's

399
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,840
a number of different ways to do that. Right now, we don't have a lot of MP3 players that

400
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,080
can really display all the meta data. And I just don't know how we're going to solve that. But

401
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,120
the simple way is just to tell people upfront, here's what's in my show and maybe even like this

402
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,280
example, what you show is about. Wow, to tech rad terrains. This podcast is coming to you just

403
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,800
east of San Diego, California, in the city of Oklahoma. I anticipate that the target audience with

404
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:51,840
this show is seasoned information technology professionals and power users. There you go. So that's

405
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,560
one way to do it, which works very fine. And I knew in just seconds, I knew well, maybe this isn't

406
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,160
for me. And by the way, I don't know if I subscribed to all this. I tried to subscribe to just

407
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,720
about everything, but I've got stuff coming in from so many different directions. And this showed up

408
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,600
on IT conversations in the iPod this morning. And I didn't recognize it. It was called, what was it

409
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,080
called? Voices in your head and the name of the track in this case was James Patrick Kelly.

410
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,520
I was like, Voices in my head, what is this? And especially from IT conversations. And I gave

411
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,280
it a listen and you'll probably be surprised when you hear it, but check it out.

412
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,800
Good music, right? You figured this is something going to be cool.

413
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:47,840
Hello and welcome to the introductory episode of Voices in your head. I'm Dave Slusher.

414
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:57,680
Whoa. Dave Slusher. Dave Slusher's got a gig. Cool. So apparently Dave Slusher is doing a

415
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,160
show for IT conversations. Let's hear all about it. Your host and my guest this week is author

416
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,800
and columnist James Patrick Kelly. As the science fiction writer, he's been nominated for all

417
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,680
of the highest awards in the science fiction field, winning the Hugo Award for his stories 10 to the

418
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,880
16th to 1 and think like a dinosaur. As a teacher, he's frequently taught at the Clarion

419
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,560
writer's workshop, where he's inspired young writer such as Cory Doctoro. In the 1990s, his before

420
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,800
mentioned story, think like a dinosaur was adapted for a radio play by the sci-fi channel

421
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,000
scene ear theater. He writes the internet column for Asimov science fiction magazine amongst his

422
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,160
many responsibilities and is experimenting with making his work available as downloadable MP3s of his

423
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,760
readings. Thanks and welcome to the show, Jim. I'd like to be here. See, that's very cool and I

424
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,160
heard about this. I knew you, I think this is what Dave Slusher did before on public radio or

425
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:56,320
I don't know if it was public radio or he was doing some kind of radio thing just recently

426
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,120
maybe a year or so ago that he wound down that show. And so he's basically interviewing

427
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,320
nonbleness writers of science fiction. So this is something that's a great show. If you're

428
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,360
in a science fiction, you're going to want to subscribe. And what I can't wait for is to see

429
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,040
IT conversations split up. So we can have, I'd like to subscribe only to memory lane,

430
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,680
Hally suit or only to voices on my head or only to the Gilmour gang. I'm sure Doug's thinking about

431
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,680
that. So that won't be long coming. The other day Dave made a comment to me. He said about Chris

432
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Perillo and I guess I'd missed that I maybe I didn't see his weblog posting or some thread that

433
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:45,280
I should have been following. But it wasn't till something showed up this morning in my iTunes that

434
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,040
Chris Perillo put together in a Chris Perillo. I believe he organizes Nomedex.

435
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,400
His weblog is locker-nome. And so the title of this podcast is locker-nome trends. And for some

436
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,040
reason, and this is the comment that I didn't pick up on earlier, he's got a stick-up as that's about

437
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,840
the terminology of podcasting and IT potter and IT pot platform. And I can totally understand

438
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,000
where he's coming from in some regard. And lots of people have been talking about, well,

439
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,280
you know, maybe you should call it something else besides anything that has the word iPod or the word

440
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,680
pod even. And yeah, that may be true. That may be true, but you know, it's stuck. It's done. I don't think

441
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,840
we can we can change it. And I don't think we should have to. I think that particularly when it comes to

442
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,680
iPod or technology, you know, iPod or stuff is just going to come built inside. You know,

443
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm hoping that, you know, some companies will license some of the code that these teams have

444
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,960
been working on so diligently and put them into their hardware. You know, make, make cell phones have

445
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,680
this built in so that when we have, you know, when your cell phone kind of a Bluetooth connection

446
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:02,240
or an ultra wide band or Wi-Fi or UMTS or the GPRS or ABC or Aluminopi connection that, you know,

447
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,560
it knows the start sucking stuff in and knows what your subscriptions are on your preferences.

448
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,760
You know, power to all that. I don't think it'll matter what that's called anymore. And people are

449
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,960
going to get, you know, if pod casting is to broadcast, what web logging is to journalism, you know,

450
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
it's like we went through the same thing with blogging. Is it web logging, blogging? Is it a blog? Is it a

451
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,520
I don't just don't think it matters, but I did enjoy what Chris Perlode did. First of all,

452
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,400
he talked to his girlfriend. He sounds really cute. He talked to his girlfriend about, you know,

453
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:46,320
pod casting and did she understand what it is? And apparently she, she doesn't know much about

454
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:55,760
technology or at least she's playing that way in this pod cast. And, you know, what, are you compelled?

455
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,840
Would you like to have this and that explains it? Well, you'll hear a bit of that, but what he also

456
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,080
did is he had a whole bunch of people he knows, called into a voicemail box, which sends off MP3's,

457
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,520
kind of a, you know, voicemail service, sends off an MP3 of the voicemail recording to his email.

458
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,480
And he put the, he's drunk those all behind each other. And there's some great names in there,

459
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,920
some great people who called in all have different things to say. We're going to listen to that together.

460
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,560
And maybe we'll have some comments on bits of it. But first let's listen to Chris talking to his girlfriend

461
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,760
about pod casting. Why can't someone else collect it and get it together? And then I just pick

462
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,440
what I want. I want it to scrape for me, I guess, or I don't know what the terminology is.

463
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,920
You shouldn't have to worry about the terminology. Exactly. And that's what's pushed the discussion

464
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,600
where it is now. Pod casting is really bored as a word. And I have to use that word now because

465
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:58,480
it's all right. Yes, it is. And I can't get around the fact that it's so

466
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:06,240
trying into an existing product, an existing community, it's still going to leave people out.

467
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,840
Okay. So that's what I mean. That's what Chris is problem is. He feels that people who don't have iPods.

468
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,240
And he actually talks about money somewhere or can't afford iPods. Like this was designed to be

469
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:26,320
some elitist group that the names all wrong. But nowhere have I heard an actual good alternative

470
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,960
from him. But let's keep listening. Question is, if we can't get all these great internet minds

471
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,200
to start thinking together and use a word that transcends the iPod, what else can we do?

472
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,960
I think that we all should send our ideas to Chris. Let him pick the one. I'm all for it.

473
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,720
Could you just take on a responsibility there? No, I'm just asking the question.

474
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,320
I like his girlfriend already. Not mainstream yet. So it's still malleable. In my opinion,

475
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,480
the more you stay podcasting as an example. Podcasting, podcasting, podcasting.

476
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,720
In the more you enforce that name. So should I just call it broadcasting and then stick with it.

477
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,240
You have to be consistent. Podcasting. If you're going to change, you have to be consistent.

478
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
But understand when you make that change, the changes to include everyone.

479
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,080
Okay, here's what we're going to try something just a little bit different. I've got a voicemail

480
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,600
system that when someone leaves me a message, it gets sent to me in MP3 format. So I thought,

481
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,360
why not ask a few of my friends to send me their thoughts on podcasting? Mind you, I wasn't on this

482
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,960
mailing list. If it works, it works. If it doesn't say no big deal, we give it a shot.

483
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,200
But let me apologize for the audio quality of these voicemails. It's better than nothing.

484
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,120
Hey man, this Robert Skobel, and I think podcasting rules. I'm sitting here listening to Adam

485
00:36:53,120 --> 00:37:01,440
Curry talking from bosom. Apparently we've worked out technology. So the smoke actually can

486
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,520
affect you if you're wearing earplugs. What's up, Skobel? And I think, you know, this is just not.

487
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,760
It's how the world's going to run. It's going to, you know, anyway. I'm hiking things that's

488
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,320
right on. I needed 20. But tonight I was at a geek dinner and talking to JP Stewart. And he

489
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,920
has pimped out his car with a windows XP machine. He has a little screen at the front and a

490
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,920
TPS and a Wi-Fi antenna. And he, you know, it dialed home through Bluetooth and his phone.

491
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,720
I think I need to get me one of those phone. It's pretty neat. But he's listening to podcast now in

492
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,720
the car. I mean, you know, I can see a world where this is going to be normal stuff. And this

493
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,160
is going to be how you get different kinds of audio and video content. Anyways, let's know next.

494
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,120
And how do you think? So I'm just going to keep playing these because these are great. There's

495
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,080
some big names that come through. That was Robert Skobel who was, uh, I call him the resident

496
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,840
blogger at Microsoft, uh, good guy. Let's see this next. This is Jake Lettingson from

497
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:19,680
Jakelettingson.com. And I think the thing for me about podcasting that is most confusing is

498
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,760
probably the name podcasting. And it implies that you need an iPod to do it. And you know

499
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,560
this guy's a shill right. You know, you know, this is a shill. I frankly, you don't need an iPod

500
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:38,240
or a Mac or it's really a platform independent way to download content on demand.

501
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,000
Whether that be audio or video from the internet, using a system that's kind of a

502
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,280
TV-like system to subscribe to specific content channels and have them automatically download to

503
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,960
your computer and then be able to come with a device. I actually created a tutorial showing you

504
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,600
how to do it using Windows Media Player and the iPod or software that's currently available

505
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,760
at iPod.org. Yeah, we actually pointed to that. I think it's a good how to.

506
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,640
Because it's so far all of the all the tutorial information has been geared towards people wanting

507
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,720
to do specifically using iPod and iPod iTunes. And I was looking at it and I don't like

508
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,520
six different devices that all can support audio, but none of them is an iPod. So I was like,

509
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,760
well, how do I do this? I went through the process. You can look at that on Jakelettingson.com.

510
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,040
And this is actually something that Microsoft sort of made in attempt at doing.

511
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,640
Now, this is interesting. Listen to this because I actually recall all of them. My mic was

512
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,840
crackling. I actually recall Microsoft doing this for for their, um, I think it was their Puck at PC,

513
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,400
but listen to the onto the objections. In like this, about three years ago, and they released a product

514
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,200
called Sinken Go as part of the Plus Digital Media Edition Pack. And basically what Sinken Go does

515
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,720
is, unless you subscribe to one of the 20 content items and have them Sink automatically to

516
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:15,280
a Puck at PC, each time you like connect your Puck at PC to the cradle. Now there are two

517
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,040
problems with that. Number one, they don't want to work with Puck at PC, so you rule about everyone

518
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:31,360
who has my pot or is a creative bend or del BJA real karma. Many of the, like dozens of other

519
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:38,560
devices are available. And it also is a closed content loop meaning that only the content providers

520
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,320
that Microsoft has selected are able to do every content. Right. So I think that's a real

521
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,880
important part there. And I'm glad that Chris is putting this up. Because, you know, yeah,

522
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,920
we may not have the name right, you know, people may not agree with that or may, you know, drive you

523
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,600
towards certain thoughts, but we have an open content pool and anyone's allowed to come and party with

524
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,840
us. So yeah, we're not as hit the Sinken Go. Now the big difference with podcasting is that

525
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:15,360
anyone can set up a podcast and make it available for people to consume. Now that doesn't mean

526
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,120
all of the podcasts are going to be great or a lot of people are going to say this.

527
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,880
Let's go to the next caller. I know you're thinking about doing this yourself.

528
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,880
And the rest of the story is really good, but you're going to listen to what he said.

529
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:57,440
Okay, okay, do you stop the year content that? Okay, all right, Chris, Steve Gilmore. Okay,

530
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,040
of the Gilmore gang, here we go, a fresh face in the crowd. Leaving you a message about podcasting,

531
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,080
which I think is the single most important thing going on in the past,

532
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:15,840
uh, at least two weeks. It's sweeping the RSS space and because it's fundamentally the same thing as RSS,

533
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:25,680
being RSS enclosures at the heart of the matter. It's going to quickly generate a lot of

534
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:34,480
attention around specifications as attention to them. Then XML, let me try that again,

535
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:44,800
attention dot XML, which is a attention metadata standard, which I hope will allow for the

536
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:53,760
evolution evolution. Excuse me, have the Roch Motel effect, which is going on with some of the

537
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:01,360
major players in the Roch Motel effect? RSS space, namely the metadata goes in and it never comes out.

538
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:09,760
Okay, so I hope this is enough for you to do a test and see how this, you might be able to

539
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:20,800
remove the screen. Hey, this is Steven Cohen from Library stuff. Thanks, Chris, for contacting me.

540
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,160
I just don't know what you're going to do. I know, I'm bored.

541
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,640
Yeah, I'll put a link to it. You can get, you can subscribe to this, but there's a whole bunch of

542
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,880
people that show up later on. Dave Winner shows up and it's just a whole, I thought it was going to be

543
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,360
interesting listening to a second time. I think you just have to go get it yourself, but it's

544
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,160
it goes on for another, let's see, oh man, it goes on for another 15 minutes of people calling in,

545
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,800
but it's a very interesting way of doing like comments, it's really what struck me about this,

546
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,280
and it could either be a one to masses type comments, but probably the other way around,

547
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,640
and this must be very easy to set up, Chris, if you have a minute, set up a pointer to

548
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,320
whatever service you're using, because if they're really firing off MP3s, that would be

549
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,640
beautiful. I could set up a rule in my mailbox that'll dump it into a folder and it'll make it

550
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,200
into a podcast so that it would just be for me, it would just be like an answering machine,

551
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,560
literally, or comments, or stuff my assistant wants me to remember, and I could put that on

552
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:24,320
and listen to it in the car, and cool way of creating a podcast feed. Okay,

553
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,480
I got a question that came in, an important one. Good evening Adam, curious, now I'm

554
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,600
off to go from the Linux link text show and dance rants for meeting my way through the earlier

555
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:41,120
episodes of Daily Source Code, and one thing that is really caught my curiosity is whether you have

556
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,320
a license to broadcast the Android Distribute, the commercial music or media files that you play,

557
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,600
and what your opinion is, those who are just getting into podcasting, who obviously look

558
00:44:53,600 --> 00:45:02,800
to your work as one of the pioneering people in podcasting, and what your opinion is on them

559
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:11,200
including commercial-based content, what concerns us or me and also discuss it on the text show

560
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,000
is that it might draw unnecessary or unwanted attention from bodies like the R, I, A, A, and the NBA,

561
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:25,840
and force their hand to crack down on podcasting for illegal distribution of commercial products.

562
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,920
Just curious is the what you think about that, and what you might have to say to other people

563
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,400
who are out there podcasting now. Thank you for taking your time to listen to this and look

564
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,440
forward to the next Daily Source Code. Right on Dan, thank you very much, I appreciate the

565
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,040
question, and to answer it right off the bat, no, I don't have a license. I have done licenses with

566
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:59,280
a particularly with BMI, I think we wrote probably the first BMI license for online music,

567
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:06,000
and that was for, but my client was Budweiser, I think, and we did something with the Budweiser site

568
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,440
and they gave a specific license, and at the time I believe it was a percentage of revenue.

569
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,080
So the answer is no, now most of the podcasts that you're hearing are just spoken word,

570
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:22,720
but just about every single podcast that I've seen come by in the past couple weeks,

571
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,720
does begin with an opening tune, and even if you're just using a few snippets or just a little bit

572
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,040
of a song in the real world outside of podcasting, you're using somebody else's intellectual

573
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,760
property, and they have rights to that, and that should be, if not compensated, at least this should

574
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:46,880
be an agreement about what kind of use that is. You're right about perhaps the leadership role

575
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,360
because I do see people emulating the format, however the rules where I live are a little bit different.

576
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:06,720
There are no people being sued by the RIA in Europe. In fact, the European Court is still

577
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,960
trying to figure a lot of these issues out, although we're probably not winning the war, we have,

578
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,280
well, maybe we are winning the war, and we lost a few important battles, but on software

579
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,240
patents things are a little bit different over here. There's a reason why Kazah was, I don't think

580
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,960
they were, they were probably founded wherever Nicholas and those guys live, but they built a company

581
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:38,160
in Amsterdam. They're just different rules about technology and peer-to-peer sharing, and we don't

582
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,920
have a couple of the laws that have been passed in the United States. That doesn't mean that

583
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,320
I think it's right, and I think that it should change. Now, conversely, I've talked about this a

584
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,760
couple of times. In Europe, in the Netherlands, at least I know 100% for sure, but in most of

585
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,920
Europe, I'm quite sure, radio and television stations pay a percentage of revenue to the licensing

586
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,920
organizations, which would be ASCAP BMI. Here, it's Buma Stemna. Every country has something, but they're

587
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:15,040
all tied together in some weird bizarre way, and only they know how that works. They pay a percentage

588
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,720
of revenue, and then they can use whatever they want. There are some restrictions, but they

589
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,360
can even use it in their promos and in their shows, and there's just a whole bunch of ways that

590
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,880
they can use that. Radio stations, exactly the same. In the States, from what I'm led to believe,

591
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,840
radio stations don't pay that type of royalty because it's seen as advertising. That's really

592
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:45,520
important because if we're going to have to be broadcasting, like Chris Perillo says, and we're

593
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,320
not podcasting, we're broadcasting. I'm all for that, but then I want broadcast rules, and I want

594
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,040
to have the same benefits. I think I could convince and make a pretty good case for most music

595
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:05,040
industry executives, who I'm sure are listening, that this is the radio of the future. Screw

596
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,320
the connections you've got with clear channel, and who you know there. This is where the new

597
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,920
radios coming from. Don't you guys have kids at the RIA? I have a 14 year old, and I see her

598
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,680
14 year old friends, and they're trading music all the time. Christina has crazy about good

599
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,760
Charlotte, and they're taping videos and sharing those with each other, and they, and it's just

600
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:34,400
as humongous build up that they witnessed together online to the release of the next album, and then

601
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,480
my daughter's cutting school to go by the good Charlotte album, which by the way, it comes in a

602
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,920
double set, so it's two CDs, exactly the same only one is called the life album, one is called

603
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,480
the death album, and each one has a separate bonus track. I mean, you got that part of the marketing

604
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,880
right? You're getting these kids to buy two CDs instead of one, but you know, see that you're

605
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,480
building up to it. Give them the tools to share. Give them the opportunity to let them work on

606
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,360
this stuff, and help you, and you will sell music. I guarantee you that, that's just you have to

607
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:12,080
figure out new ways of packaging and marketing this stuff. So, you know, I want to be treated like

608
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,240
like a broadcaster in that case, and I want to have the same type of deal, which means we shouldn't

609
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,880
have to pay anything. There is, by the way, a fee for MP3, which we discussed earlier, I posted that

610
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,920
a couple times, a pointer to it. With MP3, if you make over a hundred thousand dollars using MP3

611
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,320
as your delivery mechanism, you're content packaging, whatever the hell, however the lawyer specified

612
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:44,240
that, then there is a, I think it's 2% of gross revenue that you have to pay in licensing fees.

613
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,960
That's about it. You know, that's all that it should be, and just think of the opportunities.

614
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,440
But you're right. You know, there's a very big chance that some people will say, hey,

615
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,560
you know, this is crazy. This is, this is running rampant, but I don't know. I think that if I look

616
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,840
at the evolution of web logs, then at the beginning, a lot of journalists and a lot of newspapers

617
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,600
and big publications were saying, you know, this should be outlawed. You know, you can't have people

618
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,240
just writing a word at whatever they want on on, on woops. Oh, wait a minute. I violated like a free

619
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,040
speech thing there. No, but that's what they wanted to say, and that's how they were feeling,

620
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,640
and that was the vibe, and it's going to be the exact same thing with this. Only this is,

621
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,320
I think the speed at which we're evolving in which this is unfolding before us is going much faster

622
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,720
than the web logs, and it's because the concept is the same. We're not really learning anything new here,

623
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:40,080
except for the production. The, and in fact, in many ways, the, the consumption side of what we're

624
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:46,800
doing is easier than the web logs. And perhaps more convenient than the web logs, since you, you know,

625
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,640
it doesn't take up your web logs space. You can take up space of where you were listening to

626
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,360
boring radio, perhaps, or had nothing to do, or, you know, listening to your, the same music

627
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:00,080
tracks in a different order over and over again, and seeing if your i-cut pod could pick out a song

628
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:07,280
that matched your, you know, your mood for the day. But I do think that it's possible to get this done.

629
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,640
I know that MPR, Tony Khan, got the, for the morning stories, there's three up there now,

630
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,360
and they'll be adding more. The licensing was taken care of. So it's clearly someone knows how to do this,

631
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,600
and licensing is possible. And I think it's right, and it's fair. Even if you pay nothing,

632
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,480
we have to have an agreement because you're using something. Now, of course,

633
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,840
there's already all kinds of licensing models out there when it comes to like what I'm doing.

634
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,560
I'm playing, you know, geez, I'm, I'm like violation on top of violation. I play someone else's

635
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,640
podcast and a bit of the music that they're already illegally using. So, you know, this, it's,

636
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,320
I don't think anyone will disagree that we can make money on this. We should pass off some piece.

637
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,640
And I think that, because it's not exactly the same, it's certainly not the same as, uh,

638
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,040
streaming playlists of songs. It's not the same as sharing individual MP3 tracks, you know,

639
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,080
just like on, in American broadcast, you're not allowed to pre-announce a new, you're not allowed

640
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,760
to pre-announce a song. Well, you're not supposed to. Let's put it that way. You can back

641
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,160
announce, or you can tease with commercials in between. There's all kinds of rules so that

642
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,360
it stays within the realm of, you know, people that people could A be ready to record it,

643
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,800
or there could be deemed as a complete commercial. You know, so there's all these rules that

644
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,120
need to be looked at. And I think we fit into that very well. And if that's so, then maybe

645
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,800
just like Chris Prilas suggested, we will become broadcasters instead of mere podcasters.

646
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,120
And I'm going to violate those rules. Once again, I'm going to violate the rules. We're going

647
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,280
to stick it to the man. By major requests, I once played, uh, everybody's, uh, fucking with me,

648
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,960
by Dura Wood do Shee. And I got so many requests for either that song. I have a, I have like,

649
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,840
I have no whole album. Um, and it's, uh, you spell it, uh, as you would do, uh, DO, U, C, H, E,

650
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,840
do Shee. And, um, the next track is from that. It's an audience participation track. If so,

651
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,440
if you're in, in a, in a lyrics, then you can participate in this. Um, it's a good combination

652
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:13,760
of adult humor and, uh, some nice big band kind of blues tunes. And it is no matter what, definitely

653
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:23,840
not safe for work. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome once again to the lovely

654
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:31,040
sewer supper club, located deep in the bowels of our fair city, where the wine is fine and

655
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:40,000
the food divine. Tonight's special is plump, juicy, boned, milk fed sewer rat, floating in a

656
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,680
piquence cilantro scum sauce. Okay. Now it's time for the audience participation segment here

657
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,480
at the pristine chapel bar. And that means that it's time for your favorite song, The Limerick

658
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,760
Blues, written by our very own house piano player, or perhaps I should say, outhouse piano player,

659
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:09,440
Derwood, Du Shee accent acute over the E. You all know the routine, the band plays the Limerick

660
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,200
Blues theme once. And then when I point to you, you recite your Limerick. We're going to leave

661
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,200
the second Limerick spot blank for all you listeners out there to fill in your own Limerick.

662
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,200
So think of your favorite Limerick, title up to the band stand and get ready to blow them away

663
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:36,800
with your poem. Ready? Here we go, a one, a two, a you know what to do.

664
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:14,080
A lovely young lady named Grace, gave me head through a piece of black lace.

665
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,720
When my seamen was scattered, I saw I had splattered white freckles all over her face.

666
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,560
Man she looked go.

667
00:56:48,720 --> 00:57:07,480
Set a Japanese hooker from Kobe, to a wedding-down sailor named Toby.

668
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,640
No charge for this trick, that's a whale of a dick, and it's white, so let's

669
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:29,600
Chris and it in the movie, almost as far as we were going.

670
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,080
There once was a laugh from Nantucket, who was in the face with a bucket, too ugly to lay

671
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:56,200
shit this to say, if you don't like my made one, it's fucking it!

672
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,660
A fox a young lady from Rio, walked up and said, are you a Leo, and now she retorts

673
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:22,420
the fuck in my shorts with a splatter that real come to Rio.

674
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:27,800
I tied up a nympho and king-ta, the warps held but barely a string-ta, when I let her

675
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:33,340
loose, she gave me a goose and bit off my cock-oomed eye-lain-ta, right between the fucking

676
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:20,540
one.

677
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:26,840
Don't do shit, the limeric blues of one live in front of a Randy audience.

678
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,140
Alright, I'm going to leave you today with a bit of politics, this came through on the

679
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:37,300
feedster video and closures feed, which iPod Rex also hampily picks up for me, I always

680
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:41,180
scan through the videos, also a lot of data that comes in and gets storage, you got to do

681
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,380
it in a pretty regular basis.

682
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:51,100
This is a bit, I think it's in the house, where Tim Ryan, who's a Democrat, is, and you'll

683
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:56,540
find out at the end, is talking about the story that's been served, I've seen served

684
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,940
on the internet a couple of times, and the past few weeks, is that there is a probability

685
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:07,620
of a draft being instated, and it's really important to think about this, I remember in

686
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:13,020
90 when the first Gulf War took place, and I think I mentioned this before, I was 30

687
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:17,620
at the time, and I was pretty sure I wasn't going to be drafted, but they did ask me

688
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:25,020
to register for the draft, and I was thinking like, damn, that would really suck, besides

689
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:31,140
the fact that my sorry-wide ass wouldn't last two minutes, and no goddamn desert, as it

690
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:35,100
turns out, I found out that my ass did last for a week, but trust me, you do not want

691
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,780
to be there, certainly not if you're being shot at and blown up, and people who are there,

692
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,820
I don't want you to be there because you're not really helping them, and you don't want

693
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:48,580
to be there if you're confused, so I wanted to play this, because what this guy, he's

694
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:54,980
a young guy, Tim Ryan, it's so compelling what he says, and he's so much emotion, and

695
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:00,340
if you are old enough to vote, you're old enough to be drafted, and I suggest you vote

696
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:05,540
for John Kerry to get George W. Bush out of the White House, and here's why.

697
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:13,100
I thank the gentleman, I rise in opposition of this bill, but I would like to clarify something,

698
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:19,060
we're not trying to scare kids, this president's foreign policy is what's scaring the

699
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:24,940
kids of this country, and that people have said today, why are people believing this?

700
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,700
Why are people believing this big internet hoax?

701
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:33,300
Well, it's the same people that told us Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9-11,

702
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:37,660
same people that told us Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, same people

703
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,940
that told us we were going to be able to use the oil for reconstruction money, same

704
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:47,140
people that told us that we'd be greeted as liberators, not occupiers, same people, same

705
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:52,540
president that told us the Taliban is gone, same president that told us that Poland is

706
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:57,580
our ally two days before they pull out, same president that tells us a rack is going, just

707
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:02,740
great, same president that tells us the economy is going, just great, same people that

708
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:07,860
told us the tax cut was going to create millions of jobs, same people that told us that

709
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:15,460
the Medicare program only cost $400 billion, when it really cost $540 billion, so please

710
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:21,060
forgive us for not believing what you're saying, please forgive the students of this country

711
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:27,140
for not believing what you're saying, not one thing, not one thing about this war that has

712
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:31,380
been told to the American people, or that has been told to these college students has been

713
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,860
true, not one thing, Bremer says we need more troops, the Pentagon says we need more

714
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:42,100
troops, and this president can't get them from the international community, there's only

715
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:46,980
one option left, let's be honest with the American people, I yield back the bounce of my

716
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,420
son, whoa, all right, there you go, Tim Rines, I'm very very very clear words for you to

717
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:57,620
think about vote for John Kerry, and that's it for the source code for today, I'm

718
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:03,700
Adam Curry from Belgium, thank you for tuning in, as always comments are welcome, Adam
