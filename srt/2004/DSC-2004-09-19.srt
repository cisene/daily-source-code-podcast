1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The power of your own power is infinite.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What? Good evening, everybody!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes! It still exists!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to redo on Saturday the 18th, and here we are, 10.36pm on Sunday the 19th.

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
36 hours that I had so much to...

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
which is where I had my office.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A spaghetti factory has exploded and anyone who's ever tinkered around with audio and patch cables and wires probably knows exactly what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It kinda looks like my room when I was 6 years old too, you know, stringing wires all across the room.

9
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
So let me see, of course life got in the way of having some actual real fun here.

10
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I had to go up, I was being interviewed for a TV show so I had to be...

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And there's some financial meetings I could do and actually I really wanted to go back to Belgium

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And then possibly even fly back up to Amsterdam or even stay there

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
for the 27th annual

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
reunion of the pirate radio station I worked at in the

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
very early 80 81 79 through

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
27th annual reunion Christ. So I drove back down to Belgium and it being a Friday,

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
usually traffic is a little bit heavier. It takes about an hour and a half to get from Belgium to Amsterdam

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and vice versa from where we live. And there were a couple of accidents. So I wound up spending about

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
three hours on the road. Didn't get it until 6.30. And I said, well, screw it. I'm going to have dinner here

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
with the...

21
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
That's my daughter Christina.

22
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
She said, what are you doing?

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
What are you wearing?

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Mom's Uggs.

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
OK.

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
So it was 10.

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Oh, so it was about 7 o'clock.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
We had dinner.

29
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
And Christina was out.

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,500
She was training for horse riding.

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
So we hung out, watched a bit of TV in there on 10.15,

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
10.30.

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I said, OK, I'm going to go record the source code.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
And Patricia said, well, why don't you do that tomorrow

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
when you're nice and fresh?

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I said, no, it's Friday.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I've got to do this.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
I have to do it every single day.

39
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,500
And it was like five or six minutes late.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I was thinking about Saturday morning.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
And I was humming a tune, which is Chicago Saturday

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
in the Park.

43
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
So I'm humming this tune.

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And I'm singing along with the lyrics.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And the Patricia says, no no no no, it's uh, Saturday in the park, I think it was the first of July, and of course!

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, after 17 years of marriage, you say, wanna bet?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Right, so obviously I won the bet, which I knew I would.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You never want to bet with a disj-

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,500
And, um, as sometimes will happen between consenting adults, you know, they'll make some kind of...

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Maybe it's insurable for broadcast, no matter if it's on airwaves or on MP3.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So needless to say...

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Anyway, so to make it up and then of course I'll tell you what happened on Saturday morning and Sunday all the stuff that I went through

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, we're gonna play a couple s-

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It was the father July

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's Saturday

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The year on the park

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I said it was the father July

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's been you

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been waiting such a long time

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
People talking, me that's not it

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Singing for a star

63
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I've been waiting such a long time

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
you

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I've been waiting such a long time

66
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
from Belgium.

67
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Okay, so Saturday morning, I got up bright and early,

68
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
had all these songs all chosen, of course,

69
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
you know, it's gonna make total sense

70
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
to play that on Saturday

71
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
and to make up for missing out on Friday.

72
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,500
And I was up at 7.30, got everything together.

73
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I reverted back to the old way of recording.

74
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
And I was figuring, you know,

75
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
I'd get one source code down and then, you know,

76
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
I'd really work on my audio setup

77
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
to make the new show, Trade Secrets,

78
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
much, much better from quality, of quality.

79
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Because, you know, I was sitting in the car

80
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
for so many hours, it had my iPod with me, of course.

81
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,500
And it had the first, the inaugural Trade Secret show

82
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
loaded up on it.

83
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
So I had a chance to listen to the show

84
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
and I was not happy.

85
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I was happy with the content.

86
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
I thought it was very good for a first co-host show.

87
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Particularly if you've known each other for a long time,

88
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
because the risk, and Dave Slusher pointed this out

89
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
on the evil genius chronic.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There's a risk that you get a little buddy-buddy and then the listener is sitting there going,

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
what are these guys laughing about?

92
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But as you get to know us better, then you'll understand our humor and you'll pick up on stuff pretty quickly.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It always happens with that. I've done a lot of radio shows with co-

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And, yeah, so I really, even though technologically we had a set up pretty interesting with recording via wire tap, which records all of your Mac OS audio,

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and using, we tried Skype, Skype didn't work, and then we tried iChat with the AOL Instant Message client.

96
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And what's nice about iChat is you can route the input and the output.

97
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,500
How can we do this, like a real highly produced show that you do live to MP3 on your computer?

98
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
And do we have all the bits to do that with?

99
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Because my mic sounded really good on Trace Secrets and Dave just,

100
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
because my mic sounded so hot and so processed and his volume was soft,

101
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
that it just sounded almost like talking with a person on the phone,

102
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
which is not what I wanted it to be. I wanted it to sound much more like we're

103
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,500
more or less in the same room. So I wanted to figure all of that out, but I just cut a quick

104
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,500
source code. Do a nice 40 minute show, whatever. So I was in the 30 minutes into it,

105
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,500
then the computer froze up again, just like it had done three times when Dave and I started

106
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,500
recording the first Trace Secrets, which was so hard man, because your energy is gone.

107
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
It's hard to tell the same story again because it's just not fresh anymore.

108
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,500
And still, I think we did a pretty good job, but it was so frustrating Saturday morning and it

109
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
froze up and then I'd say, okay, I'm...

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
to go back to the bare basics and what are going to use wire tap and just a little bit

111
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
of microphone processing and the quick time player and then that start crashing.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I said, you know what?

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Screw it.

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to figure out how to get this audio stuff working the way I want it before I record

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
another show.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, have you ever been trying to get somewhere from anyone with like a train or an airplane?

117
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We need the connection.

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And someone eventually will say to you, excuse me, you just can't get here.

119
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Get there from here.

120
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, let me move my life out of the way of my necklace.

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There.

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hello.

123
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You know, so this is kind of the same with what I'm trying to do here with the

124
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
audio set up on the Mac.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You cannot get there from here, at least not with the tools that you have.

126
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hold on.

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let me just stick that inside there.

128
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There we go.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Here's what I wanted.

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Now anyone who's who's worked in a radio studio or in any type of audio

131
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
studio, you know that you have all your outputs and you want to have

132
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
sends to send stuff to, you know, rather.

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:42,500
it to a different place and trying to find the combination of being able to route audio

134
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
into the right places and to record it all and to be able to shut off the mic selectively

135
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
so that it doesn't keep on recording was very, very difficult.

136
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,500
There is no application as far as I know for OSX, for Mac that will let you do exactly

137
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
what I want to achieve.

138
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,500
So here's how I had it set up at a certain point and I have seen the limits of the G4 processor ladies and gentlemen.

139
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I have been to the edge and it doesn't

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to do and I'll tell you what the solution is. So what I want to be able to do is, well,

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
basically there is no program that I could find that would let you address more than

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
one audio interface per channel on a mixing console because that's really what I need.

143
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Now there's all kinds of virtual devices that you can set up. You have Soundflower

144
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which gives you two channels in, two channels out of a virtual device. You have Soundflower

145
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
16 which obviously gives you 16 channels. These, and they work very well.

146
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Also you have something called Jack Tools. Jake Savin from Userland sent me an email.

147
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
knows damn well what's out there and what's available.

148
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,500
He also pointed to Jack Tools and he said, you know, this stuff is open source.

149
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
It's come from the Linux world, but still all pretty much cutting edge.

150
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Yeah, boy is it.

151
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
It does work.

152
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,500
You know, you can actually route the sound out of one application into another application.

153
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
And at a certain point I had it all set up.

154
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Everything was working.

155
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I could selectively route things left and right.

156
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,500
The problem was you're sending all of this audio through virtual audio devices and delay

157
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
builds up latency.

158
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
It starts off with maybe just a millisecond or two.

159
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
And then before you know it, you know, you do something else, you move your mouse and

160
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
then, you know, it's going to start caching that and storing it in different places in

161
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
memory.

162
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:43,500
And then basically on the headphones, I'd hear my voice delayed, which makes it very difficult

163
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,500
to talk because, you know, the machine had it.

164
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I opened up a terminal.

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
window and I did a top command that was running like an average of 11 or 12 on the load on

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the machine.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And the first thing I thought was, oh, I need to do a processor now.

168
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But then I was like, no, you're never going to get it exactly synced up.

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's always going to be a delay.

170
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now my PowerBook, as with most Macs, has an internal device, but you can only switch

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
between your internal microphone or your line input.

172
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And it only really has one real input device.

173
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So I had to break down.

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I didn't want to, but I guess there's no other choice.

175
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
hardware device. Now I happen to have sitting around, I've had it for a long

176
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
time, never really used it. It's an M-Box from Digi Design. It's just a little, and

177
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
thank God it's not too big, so it's still portable. It's a little plastic box.

178
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:57,500
It connects by USB to the computer. It has two inputs. One mix output and it has,

179
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,500
hold on a second, let me just see what I've got here. Yeah, and it has a volume for

180
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
headphones. I can also provide phantom power 48 volts if needed and you can

181
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:14,500
switch those inputs between a line or a mic or a MIDI instrument.

182
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So, I believe it or not, I now have it so that,

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and I purchased DJ 1800, which is like, I think it's $35.

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it's, you basically have a visual interface of four playback decks.

185
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And they pretty much look like either a digital deck or a,

186
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
it has a very VCR quality to it.

187
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But it looks a lot like studio CD players that we've used on radio studios.

188
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And you can cue up stuff real quick and it automatically detects the beginning and the end of a track.

189
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And you can, you know, loop it.

190
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's a countdown timer.

191
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can speed through it really quickly, step through exactly what you want.

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
With four faders for outputs, you can route stuff to a different output for,

193
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
if you know, if you want to cue something up so that it's not being recorded.

194
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now I'm sending the output of that just to the regular speakers.

195
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm using GarageBand for the mic processing.

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Also, so that's just grabbing the microphone in and that literally is.

197
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Let me see.

198
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Oh, that's grabbing from the M-Box because the microphone is plugged into the M-Box.

199
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
It gets crazier.

200
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
But here's the way I did it.

201
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,500
So somewhere I had to build one routing, one connection between two different devices,

202
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
and neither of them could be a virtual device.

203
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:42,500
So indeed, I now have, from the headphones, going out is a 3.5mm stereo jack, going

204
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
into two XLRs, which are the, you know, if you've ever seen those, those are professional plugs.

205
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Often you see them on microphones.

206
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,500
It's a round plug with three big holes, or if it's a male connector, three prongs in there.

207
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,500
And that's being fed into the DigiDesign hardware box.

208
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
So that's now become an input.

209
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
And all of that eventually routes into Audio Hijack Pro, which I also purchased.

210
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Otherwise, after 10 minutes, you get this really nasty hissing sound.

211
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
And that is recording everything that's coming off of that box.

212
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
So in theory, I can send all this.

213
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
information I can write, you know, a whole bunch more of applications output to the

214
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
inbox because it's all sitting there in a chip, I guess, in theory. There's no

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
memory that's being swapped from disk or anything that can really slow down and I

216
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
think it can handle quite a lot and it's really only getting, you know, one

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
signal that's already mixed. So I think that I should be able to do quite a

218
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
lot and of course now I can add a either an iChat call and I can route

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
back to it from anything that I want to. So for the next trade secrets, I should be

220
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
able to not only get Dave's quality equal to mine, but I should also be able to send

221
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
it when I play something. He should be able to hear that on his head, on his end,

222
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
even if I'm playing an mp3. Okay, so you can only imagine that this took all of

223
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Saturday up until 1am and that's when I finally gave up. You know, actually I

224
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
thought I had it all running at 1am and I was still, excuse me, using wiretap and damn it.

225
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
killed it, like 30, again 30 minutes into it.

226
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,500
So, there's nothing more damning than having recorded something

227
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
and really put some effort into whatever you're saying

228
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
and then just have that crash and be totally gone.

229
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
So I needed something really stable

230
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
and I think I have this set up.

231
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
And I'll really list this and take some screenshots

232
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
so everybody can see what the setup is

233
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
because I know that not many people

234
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
are on this path trying to make this happen.

235
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
But it can be done.

236
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
It's just the external box that pisses me off

237
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
that I have to have that.

238
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,500
But until I have two different sound devices in my computer

239
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
or if anyone makes one like that that's portable,

240
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
just have to live with this.

241
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Let's see, what I want to talk about.

242
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Oh, it's funny because so this morning,

243
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
again got up really early

244
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
because we had to go to a big fashion show

245
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
that Patricia does every year or every season actually

246
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
with Paul Schilter.

247
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
He's a...

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
a big fashion guy here in the Netherlands, actually in Europe.

249
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And he has a huge, so 750 people.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And she designs the makeup, works with the models.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
She also has a big influence on all of the clothing stuff that he does.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This year, we had our flat screens, the Grand Master View flat screens.

253
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm a shareholder in the company.

254
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
These are flat screens that are 2 meter 20 diagonal.

255
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's the consumer version.

256
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We can make them so big you wouldn't believe.

257
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So I was there selling screens.

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Patricia was there with her cosmetics company.

259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And she also did something very cool.

260
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She did a song.

261
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
She performed a song at the very end of the show.

262
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And all the models came out and danced with her.

263
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And I played that one for you because it's just kind of cool

264
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and it's rather short.

265
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's my wife.

266
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
My husband.

267
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Italiano.

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm a source girl.

269
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Hey Goomba, I love how you dance so Goomba

270
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
That's where you never gonna be nowhere in the-

271
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
She can love you

272
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I'm gonna say to you

273
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
She can love you

274
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I'm gonna say to you

275
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
She can love you

276
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Mambo

277
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Italian girl

278
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I don't know what to cook into the night.

279
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
She's taking me by the pizzeria down the way to Monteria

280
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Don't you tell your mom, mom's gonna tell her about it

281
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There's nothing to it, come and baby listen to it

282
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Mambo Mambo, Italian, oh Mambo Mambo

283
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
You mixed up with Jesus

284
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I'm not sure what to do with this.

285
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
I'm always at the unknown.

286
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
My wife.

287
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
On the source code.

288
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Go figure.

289
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Man, if I played my wife's song on the radio, people would be so pissed off.

290
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
No, no, no, you can't do that because you know, that's like...

291
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Anyway, my show, do whatever the hell I want.

292
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Okay, let's switch gears here for a second.

293
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Need to talk about a couple things.

294
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,500
First of all, as I was on the road a lot, I also caught Dave Slusher's source code

295
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
for yesterday.

296
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
I'm on the source code.

297
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And he came up with something. He caught a refer which was hitting his or was it his bit

298
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
torrents? Well, you'd have to listen to the latest show to get all of that. I don't have it queued up

299
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
right now. But he saw in his refer log, I think it was a podcaster.net and he's coined podcasting.

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And I'm like, I'm all for that. That sounds good. We're podcasting everybody. Of course,

301
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you have to all agree that pods are MP3 devices. I don't think Apple can see us for pods, can they?

302
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So podcasting, I'm digging that. Like it. Which brings me from the bit torrent brings me to the iPod

303
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
list. I also haven't had a lot of time for email. Haven't even posted anything on the web.

304
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
deep into the core audio of Mac OS X that I did skim through most of the messages on

305
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the iPod developer list.

306
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's a great, great vibe that's there.

307
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Everyone's using each other's code, commenting on how we can make it all better.

308
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I see that we kind of want to have some set definitions as to what an iPod is so we can

309
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
all make a version with some either multiple versions with the same functionality or maybe

310
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
we come up with some common gold standard that everybody uses and tomorrow I'll be able to

311
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
focus on that and see what I can contribute.

312
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But some great iPod versions are out there.

313
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's hard to even keep track of at this point.

314
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I think I spidered on evil gene.

315
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
which I have tried now it has an install package for OSX.

316
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It adds a cron job.

317
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
See there was some other great features that it has.

318
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh, it also understands BitTorrents.

319
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is really cool.

320
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So if you attach a BitTorrent of your show,

321
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
then it knows to go out, download the torrent file

322
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and then put that in your items.

323
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And woo, I gotta try the new version of iPod tomorrow

324
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
because that's exactly what I'm looking for.

325
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
really hookin' this all together. It's just phenomenal.

326
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
See, there was something on IT conversations that I was listening to. It wasn't the most recent Gilmore gang.

327
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,500
On the road I listened to about half of the show and they were talking about, it was about

328
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,500
IT and law and although sometimes very technical and a bit over my head, I do like listening

329
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
to those types of conversations.

330
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,500
And this one focused a lot on the three different music services, of course IT Music Store from

331
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Apple, Microsoft and Reel.

332
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,500
And as I was listening to this, I'm like, how, here are these guys, these big companies

333
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,500
and they see the music businesses in trouble and it's as if they're trying to say, oh,

334
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
you know, it's up for grabs.

335
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
I'm going to go, you know, we're going to go get this market.

336
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I don't think that's, you know, that's where the big money is, you know, look at,

337
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,500
look at what's happening all of a sudden with, with the, with the iPod platform.

338
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Look, we're using this as completely not in the way they ever thought over the

339
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:17,500
way to design it.

340
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,500
And as long as we keep using MP3s and keep that to ourselves, then we're going to

341
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
be, we're going to be pretty good.

342
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Although there's a lot to say for other formats and a lot of people are looking

343
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
at AC files, which is.

344
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I guess proprietary compression which includes DRM and also some nifty features like bookmarking.

345
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But I'm going to keep it with MP3 because I think that's the format that we have to protect and have to serve.

346
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There was so much, you know, I've started this show so many times over the past couple of days.

347
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So much to talk about.

348
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Darn.

349
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Well, I have a couple other things queued up and ready to go for you.

350
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I was thinking about the George Carlin bit that I played, how long was that?

351
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Must have been last week, maybe the beginning of last week, and I played the bit about stuff.

352
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And as I was working with this new DJ 1800 program, which I'm just really happy about how it performs,

353
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
it also integrates with iTunes so you can just drag something out of your iTunes playlist right onto a player and it works.

354
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And it'll eat anything that...

355
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
that iTunes does or the QuickTime does, I guess.

356
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,500
And I ran across a show from 1999, George Carlin,

357
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I believe it was on HBO, and I had an audio file of that

358
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
for some reason, well, because I like it so much.

359
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
And he does this one bit, which now, of course,

360
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,500
this is pre-911.

361
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
And the bit is about airport security.

362
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,500
And although, you know, not if you thought that this was

363
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
done just yesterday or anytime post-911,

364
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
you might be offended by some bit.

365
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
So you have to take into consideration and keep in mind

366
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,500
that this is from 1999, at the time when I was traveling

367
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
a lot in America, I was on flights all the time.

368
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,500
And then George Carlin comes out with this great bit

369
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
about airport security and think,

370
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
and just listen to what he's saying

371
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,500
and listen to how insightful he was at the time

372
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
and also think about where we are today

373
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
with security in general,

374
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
and certainly when it comes to airport security.

375
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
George Carlin.

376
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
with airport security.

377
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and it makes the world a lot easier to sort out.

378
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
First thing on my list tonight, airport security.

379
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Tired of this shit. There's too much of it.

380
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
There's too much security at the airport.

381
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm tired of some guy with a double digit IQ

382
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and a triple digit in...

383
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
haven't found anything yet.

384
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Haven't found one bomb in one bag.

385
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,500
And don't tell me, well, the terrorists know their bags are going to be searched,

386
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
so now they're leaving their bombs at home.

387
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
There are no bombs.

388
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
The whole thing is fucking pointless.

389
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,500
It's completely without logic.

390
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
There's no logic at all.

391
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
They'll take away a gun, but let you keep a knife.

392
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Well, what the fuck is that?

393
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,500
In fact, there's a whole list of lethal objects they will allow you to take onboard.

394
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Theoretically, you could take a knife, a nice pick, a hatchet, a straight razor,

395
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
a pair of scissors, a chainsaw, six knitting needles, and a broken whiskey bottle.

396
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,500
And the only thing they're going to say to you is that bag has to fit all the way under the seat in front of you.

397
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
If you didn't take a weapon on board, relax.

398
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,500
After you've been flying for about an hour, they're going to bring you a knife and fork.

399
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
To they give you a fucking knife

400
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,500
It's only a table knife, but you could kill a pilot with a table knife

401
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Might take a couple of minutes, you know

402
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Especially if he's hefty, huh?

403
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Yeah, but you could get the job done. You really want to kill the prick

404
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,500
But there's a lot of things you could use to kill a guy with you could probably beat a guy to death with a Sunday, New York

405
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Or, suppose you just had really big hands.

406
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Couldn't you strangle a flight attendant?

407
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Sure you could probably strangle two of them, one with each hand.

408
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know, if you were lucky enough to catch him in that little kitchen area, before they

409
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
give out the fucking peanuts, you know?

410
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But you could get the job done, if you're really cared enough.

411
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So why isn't they allow a man with big powerful hands to get on board an airplane?

412
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll tell you why.

413
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
They know he's not a security risk because he's already answered the three big questions.

414
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Question number one, did you pack your bags yourself?

415
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000
No.

416
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
My bad

417
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
He and Martha Stewart and Florence Henderson came over to the house last night,

418
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:29,500
fixed me a lovely lobster new burger, gave me a full body massage with sacred oils from India,

419
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
performed a far way around the world, and then they packed my bags.

420
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Next question.

421
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
You're back been in your possession the whole time. No

422
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Usually the night before I travel just as the moon is rising

423
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Place my suitcases out on the street corner and leave them there unattended for several hours

424
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Just for good luck

425
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Next question

426
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
As any unknown person asked you to take anything on board

427
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
hmm

428
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Well, what exactly is an unknown person?

429
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Surely everyone is known to someone

430
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,500
in fact just this morning Karim and you said Ali Ben Gabbá

431
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
They didn't know each other quite well

432
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500
They kept joking about which one of my suitcases was the heaviest

433
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:37,500
And that's another thing they don't like at the airport jokes, you know, yeah, you can't joke about a bomb

434
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Well, why is it just jokes what about a riddle?

435
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
How about a limerick?

436
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
How about a bomb anecdote?

437
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,500
You know, no punchline, just a really cute story.

438
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Or, suppose you intended to remark, not as a joke, but as an ironic musing.

439
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Are they prepared to make that distinction?

440
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Why, I think not.

441
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
And besides, who's to say what's funny?

442
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Airport security is a stupid idea that's a waste of money

443
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,500
and it's only there for one reason to make white people feel safe.

444
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
That's all. The illusion.

445
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
The feeling and illusion of safety.

446
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Because the authorities know they can't make an airplane completely safe.

447
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You'll notice the drug smugglers don't seem to have a lot of trouble getting their little packages on board, do they?

448
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, and God bless them too!

449
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
By the way, an airplane flight shouldn't be completely safe.

450
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You need a little danger in your life.

451
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Take a fucking chance once in a while, will you?

452
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What are you gonna do? Play with your prick for another 30 years?

453
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
What are you gonna read, People Magazine and Eat It Wendy's till the end of time?

454
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Take a fucking chance.

455
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Besides, even if they made all the airplanes completely safe,

456
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the terrorists would simply start bombing other places that are crowded.

457
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Porn shops, track houses, city bars and gang bangs.

458
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Hello.

459
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Entertainment venues.

460
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The odds of you being killed by a terrorist are practically zero.

461
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So I say relax and enjoy the show.

462
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You have to be a realist. You have to be realistic about terrorism.

463
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Certain groups of people, certain groups,

464
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Muslim fundamentalists, Christian fundamentalists, Jewish fundamentalists,

465
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and just plain guys from Montana.

466
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
continue to make life in this country very interesting for a long, long time.

467
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That's the reality.

468
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Angry men in combat fatigues talking to God on a two-way radio and muttering incoherent

469
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
slogans about freedom are eventually going to provide us with a great deal of entertainment.

470
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Especially after your stupid fucking economy collapses all around you and the terrorists

471
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
come out of the woodwork and you'll have anthrax in your water supply and sarin gas

472
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
in your air condition that'd be chemical and

473
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
enjoy the show take a fucking chance put a little fun in your life

474
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
to me terrorism is exciting it's exciting

475
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I think the very idea that you can set off a bomb in a marketplace and kill

476
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
several hundred people

477
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But we also know that most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they

478
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
don't realize there's such a thing as being...

479
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one.

480
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I've always been willing to put myself at great personal risk

481
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
for the sake of entertainment.

482
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And I've always been willing to put you at great personal risk

483
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
for the same reason.

484
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
As far as I'm concerned, all of this airport security,

485
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
all the searches, the screenings, the cameras,

486
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
the questions, it's just one more way.

487
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
As long as you put up with it.

488
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
As long as you put up with it.

489
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Which means of course, any time they want.

490
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Because that's what Americans do now.

491
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,500
They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom

492
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
in exchange for the feeling, the el-

493
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness.

494
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There's another thing, germs. Where did the sudden fear of germs come from?

495
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
In the country of Harlem.

496
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:51,000
1999, about airport security, about terrorism, and about your personal freedom, fellow Americans.

497
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Holy moly, what an insight. 1999. I wonder if he'd do the same routine again today, and if he'd change anything, what he'd be changing.

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Okay, it's now 11.13. Unfortunately, I can't use Audio Hijack Pro to cut.

499
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
because once again I'm taxing the processor and it actually starts to skip little bits

500
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
of recording which blows.

501
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So I'm recording it to AIFF which is a format that I have a nice little Apple script for

502
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that.

503
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,500
M-A-A-M, which is MPEG to AIFF or AIFF to MPEG.

504
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
We actually wrote that script when we were doing our reality show because we had so many,

505
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,500
we put all kinds of great tunes in the show,

506
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,500
and of course they were all downloaded from the internet,

507
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
and we had to get them into Final Cut Pro,

508
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,500
which I don't think the new version eats MP3s yet.

509
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
And AIFF is just much easier for it to work with, less processor intensive

510
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
because it's file, you know, there's so much more information there,

511
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
it doesn't have to go through so much compression and decompression.

512
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,500
And so we, you know, we just have a script, a little droplet, you drag MP3 onto it,

513
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,500
turns into an AIFF with the same name and vice versa.

514
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
So I have to do the conversion and then I can upload it to the server.

515
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,500
So it may even be Monday the 20th by the time the show gets up on the air.

516
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,500
And again, I apologize for the radio silence or the podcasting silence.

517
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:30,500
I will be sure to do a little more coherent show tomorrow, also it won't be cool.

518
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
quite as tired. It's been a really long weekend and I got a lot of cleaning up to do. There's

519
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
wires everywhere. And of course now for the next four days, I'm Mr. Mom. Patricia stayed

520
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
in Amsterdam with her sister at the bunker and they're off to the UK tomorrow to go and

521
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
look at houses. And she's got the video camera with her. So, yes, Jesse, hold on,

522
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the dog wants to go out. So depending on the footage that she brings back, maybe

523
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
you'll post some of that online. Go ahead.

524
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I said, just gonna walk out the back here for a second.

525
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Ah, it's a lovely night.

526
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
If you can hear that, that's our fountain over on the other side of the courtyard.

527
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Total silence here. I'm gonna miss this

528
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Our nice castle in

529
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Flanders in Belgium I

530
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
can see

531
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Fred and ginger are two black swans with their six babies which aren't even babies anymore

532
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
They're walking on the grass back here. They're gonna start flying pretty soon

533
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
They're gonna try to start flying which is always hilarious

534
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Because they you know sometimes it's it's like the keystone cops. You know and they they even fly into each other

535
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You done Jess come on

536
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
This is Jesse one of our three dogs. Good

537
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So tomorrow morning to some more techno talk because of course

538
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The credo of source code is that we try to make the place where users and developers party together

539
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And there's a lot more to talk about these are the iPod or the iPod platform podcasting and all that other groovy stuff

540
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I've got to go put my daughter to bed right now

541
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So again, mr. Ball be real busy. You know we have goats and chickens and

542
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,500
horses and really start to appreciate what someone else does in the household.

543
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,500
So I'm going to leave you with that for today and I will be back.

544
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We're the new source code for Monday, September.

545
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
As always, if you want to respond to-

546
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
code on the website.

547
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
The power of the door is lost.

548
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,500

550
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
See you tomorrow on the source code!
