1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Autistic, here's the Battle of Curry.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The power of the Lord is coming.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, everybody how you doing?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Saturday night coming to you from Curry Cottage in the UK.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right. We are here. We have arrived.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Can't say the same for the connectivity,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
but it's time to put on our little show.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The power of the Lord is coming.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The show known as the Daily Source Code. My name is Adam Curry.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It is Saturday, November.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I hope the heck are we today.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
November 20th, 2004.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Coming to you from the United Kingdom from our brand new home.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's been, I don't know, she was a bit about three days

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
since I've been able to do a source code.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've been doing so much.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Basically, I'm packing boxes.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The number one thing that I've been doing.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Getting situated, figuring out the neighborhood,

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
figuring out where there's Wi-Fi.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, you know what I want to do.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to take you on a little tour of the Cottage here.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I want to walk through some of the halls.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe give you some of the outside sounds.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Since what we have compared to comparison material,

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
we've heard outside sounds from Belgium.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It would be nice to hear them from the United Kingdom.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right off the bat, just because I really want to share some

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
some vibe and memories with all of you.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to have to say, fuck the RIA, sue me.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just have to play this one for you.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You placed the flowers in the vase that you bought today.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Steering at the fire,

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
for hours and hours,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
while I listen to you,

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
play your own songs all night long.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, me, me,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
only for me.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Going to me now,

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to my nest,

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to head for just five minutes.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Every thing is gone.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Such a cozy,

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
such a cozy window,

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
so I don't need to buy anything.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, shine through them.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Fire regions for you.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Only for you.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our house is a very, very, very fine house

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
with two cats in the yard.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Life is to be so hard.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now everything is easy because of you.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, no, no, no no, no, no.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no,

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:38,000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:04:09,000
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:39,000
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,160
the first floor of the house. Or is that the second floor? I guess if ground floor is

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,920
first floor then this is the second floor. Or it's the first story, whichever way you

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,760
want to look at it. Got it really nice set up here. Basically all the stuff that

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:00,200
Christina had hijacked in the bar at the castle. I now have to myself. I've got my

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,720
what is it cinema display monitor, which is now hooked up to my own power book. I've got

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,080
all my audio stuff, my breakout boxes. Actually I'm doing today's or this

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:21,160
this evening show partially at least on my sure SM7 microphone, which is I've actually

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,360
have no idea how it sounds. It sounds a little, I think it's a little bit of hiss to it,

66
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,720
which I think is probably let me see. Maybe that's probably the mixer I've got.

67
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm going to have to figure out the best settings for all the stuff that I've got here

68
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,920
and certainly for this microphone. I also have the wireless mic which I'm going to switch over

69
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,600
to in a second so we can cruise around the house. I'm trying to think where to start, man.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,920
So the last time we spoke we read the castle a very, very empty castle at that. And we were

71
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,960
getting ready to leave. Let's see, we left on Thursday. Patricia and her sister IvÃ¡n

72
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,440
were already here. And they were basically working with the movers on packing stuff. Patricia

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,760
called somewhere around Thursday and she said, oh man, I don't know. I don't know what to do.

74
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,440
There's just too much stuff. I'm going to have to send stuff back. And when you think about it,

75
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,680
we probably moved about three houses worth of stuff. We pretty much emptied out the bunker and

76
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,280
Amsterdam. That's now been rented out to that reality show. The next Moscow beats is the name of it.

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,440
Moscow beats is a name of very famous trial lawyer in Holland who represents all kinds of people.

78
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,480
Showed his piece of people but also criminals. Everything but war criminals because he's Jewish and

79
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,920
he refuses to represent war criminals but he has no problem with any other type of criminal.

80
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,360
But he's a nice guy actually. He's a very celebrated attorney. And so I guess there's like 10

81
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,800
candidates or whatever. They move in tomorrow. In fact, and two are going to fall by the way,

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
so I'd almost immediately. But they're all going to stay in the bunker. They work in the bunker.

83
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,440
And the house is actually not that far from from Moscow beats. In fact, it's just around the corner

84
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,040
from Moscow beats is office in Amsterdam. So we had to move all that chunk out. We moved everything

85
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,240
out of the castle. We still had stuff from the states. And what happened is it arrived here.

86
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:34,040
And this house is the rooms that we utilize. It's probably not much smaller than or let's say

87
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,440
it's probably two thirds of what we utilize in Belgium at the castle. But the house itself is about

88
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,840
an a quarter of the size. So that means that you're lacking in storage space. And we had all this

89
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,280
stuff that just was kind of stored in cabinets and closets and rooms and whatever. And it's just

90
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,120
it's turned out that we got a shit load of stuff. So more about the stuff in just a second.

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:09,480
So Christina and I, I had booked a buddy of mine, yapped the fissor. He has a, he has a beautiful

92
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,760
airplane. He has a twin engine. It's a pipe or Navajo. It's an old old beast. But it does the job

93
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,600
perfectly. Cruises about 160 knots. So perfect to leave from Antwerp, which is about 20 minutes from

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,840
our house. For an hour and 15 minute flight, right to, and by the way, I'm not mentioning on the podcast

95
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,520
exactly where it is. We moved because the last thing I want is the Dutch press showing up here,

96
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,360
you know, going around. Because it's the town of small enough for people to figure out where we are.

97
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,520
And I just don't, you know, that's one of the reasons we left. So until everything was quieted down,

98
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,840
we'll just leave it in the middle. Although I can tell from all of the well wishes that I've received

99
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,480
from, and it was really beautiful. All these people from the UK welcoming me, leaving comments saying,

100
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,400
hey, you know, if you want an Earl Grey in the split, look me up. That's great. And I will take

101
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,120
some people up on those offers, believe me. But a lot of people have already kind of figured out

102
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,520
where we are. So there's an airport about 15 minutes from our house. It's a small airport. It's a,

103
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:18,280
it's a, you know, one runway. It is a paved runway. So it's not a grass strip, but it's just about

104
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,520
a level above a grass strip to be quite honest. And we had announced that we'd be arriving

105
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,760
from a different country, which you have to do, because it's not a, it's not an international

106
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,320
field. Excuse me. So what the, what the customs do is they send someone out. And they don't

107
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,320
actually, they don't even usually send someone out. But in this case, they did. And so the lady asked

108
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,880
for my passport and Christina's passport and stamped it. And we had a nice little chat. Didn't ask

109
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,080
anything about the dogs or the cats. I had both dogs and both cats in the plane. And, you know,

110
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,240
so I just kind of left the door closed. I figured, you know, shit, why go through, you know,

111
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,720
two hours of paperwork if I don't have to. And besides that, our cats Cindy, Cindy is the,

112
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,720
we found him at a, at a gas station in the States when he still lived in New Jersey.

113
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,960
When he was like three weeks old, nurse him to health. And he's become this ferocious,

114
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,960
amazingly strong animal. Just beautiful, very sweet, but man, he, I mean, even the vet

115
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,680
who does horses is afraid of this cat. And Cindy cannot handle traveling. Oh, man, he just gets so

116
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,160
motion sick. And, you know, so he thinks shit coming out of him from all ends and orifice is

117
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,640
really sad. So the plane stunk the high hill. Anyways, I would just left that door closed and

118
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,800
lady, the lady left after stamping our passports. And so I got the dogs out and got the cats. They were

119
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,920
in their nice little baskets. And we had two calves waiting and put the cats in one cabin,

120
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,560
Christina and I and our suitcases and the dogs and the other and drove off to the house here.

121
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,280
And where everyone was waiting. And you know, that we had two trucks here. The, the movers were here.

122
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,760
And then I saw what Patricia met. You could not walk in this house because of the boxes. It was

123
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,040
unbelievable. So the garage, I mean, the garage immediately, we decided was not going to take cars.

124
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,600
And I brought the Audi over since there's still a year on the lease and then I'll, you know,

125
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,480
I'll get rid of it after that. That has a great GPS. I love the GPS. It immediately recognizes

126
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,120
the UK and where I am. So I'm really happy with that. So I can focus on driving on the left hand side

127
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,080
of the road. Which, by the way, is the correct hand side. And I found out why. Because

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,320
back in the day when roads were kind of still first invented, I guess around these parts.

129
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,560
And you'd be on your horseback. Let's just say, I'm the night in shining armor. The white

130
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,720
night, of course, boogin' along right there on the left hand side. Because if I see all of a sudden

131
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:07,400
on the right hand side, there's the black night coming towards me. I want to draw my sword in my

132
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,400
right hand. So it makes a lot of sense to be riding on the left if I'm going to jouse this guy or

133
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,040
chop his head off while he's coming towards me. Unless, of course, I'm left handed, but I guess

134
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,080
pretty much in those days, everyone fought with their right hand. So that means that left is the correct

135
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,080
side to drive on. I presume. And you know what? It really doesn't matter. It's kind of funky

136
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,760
when you're turning corners or you're going around about, or definitely, I find myself waiting

137
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,920
being very cautious and then hammering the accelerator to make sure I get around the roundabout.

138
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,480
Because you go around in a different direction, yeah, you go around in a clockwise direction,

139
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,920
instead of counterclockwise. It's just getting used to it. And probably it's going to make me

140
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,400
smarter doing this because all the neurons are firing and reconnecting and trying to figure out

141
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,240
which way it goes. So I guess that's almost proven to make you smarter. So I'm kind of happy about that.

142
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,560
So we made a very conscious decision. What we already did that when we moved here, we said,

143
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:12,280
you know, guys, we, you know, we're going to get rid of a lot of our stuff. And now we have

144
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,480
totally gone all the way and we said, look, we're just going to get rid of all of this stuff.

145
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,440
You know, we have too many clothes, just too much shit. And we now have four full boxes

146
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,560
that are ready for for charity. And there was just a big charity kind of like a telethon on

147
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,600
last night, which is for the children. They do it every year here in the UK. It goes from,

148
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,360
I saw like 7 p.m. went to 4 o'clock in the morning. It was unbelievable.

149
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:49,640
Excuse me. So we have an address to send stuff. And, you know, we got like Gucci shoes.

150
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,720
And just we're rebooting our life, basically. And I'm so happy for it.

151
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,040
And notice I didn't throw out any of my or recycle or give away my technology bits. We got to keep

152
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:08,120
some of the stuff sane. But, you know, we got chairs and tables and desks and couches and just,

153
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,960
you know, too much. So we're getting rid of all of it. Can't use it. Give it away.

154
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,240
Give it away. Give it away. Now. Oh, by the way, you're listening to the daily source code.

155
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,720
It is 930 Saturday evening here in the United Kingdom at Curry Cottage. Let's see,

156
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,200
what else do we have to talk about? And I'm going to walk through the house in a bit and

157
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,280
admit it and give you just some of the, some of the highlights of it. And that you hear some of the sounds.

158
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:41,800
Oh, so we got in rather late or rather late. We're on 4 or 5 in the afternoon and, you know,

159
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,720
freaking out about all these boxes. And then we, you know, Patricia and I basically, you know,

160
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,040
found our bed between all the boxes, went to sleep, Christina slept in her own room.

161
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,320
Any von Patricia Sisters still here helping out. And the next morning, let's say around 10, 10 o'clock,

162
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,280
there's a ring at the doorbell. And it's a gentleman who says, hi, I'm from the, and I can't

163
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,080
remember what he said. It must have been the, it sounded like Homeland Security Department. But of

164
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,720
course, it wasn't. And he said, I'm here investigating for illegal animals that you brought into

165
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,520
the country. And we're like, huh, illegal animals. And of course, we had all the paperwork, but essentially

166
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:26,040
what happened is the airport where we landed. You know, so I guess someone noticed that we brought

167
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,480
all these animals out of the, out of the plane after the customs official had left called the,

168
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,240
and it's a big deal here, because they used to have quarantine for six months. And now you can

169
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,880
get in as long as your pets have been microchipped. They've got a passport. They have their rabies shots.

170
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,720
They have their tick and, and, and, and lint worms, uh, uh, uh, inoculations and all that. You've

171
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:53,160
got to have all this document. And so we had all of that. Um, so we had to go through the whole thing,

172
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,800
uh, and exactly what I thought it took about two hours. But the guys were really nice.

173
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,280
Now the guy had to come over with the, uh, with the microchip reader. I guess it was kind of an RFID chip

174
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,960
that they shoot into the pets, uh, neck or whatever. And, you know, registers, registers, registers,

175
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,760
everything all checked out. But wow, they don't mess around, man. And it, they used to be that

176
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,920
they would actually dispose of the animal immediately, if they caught it illegally in the country,

177
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,440
because they're definitely afraid. I've been, been that way for hundreds of years,

178
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,600
definitely afraid of rabies because basically you're on an island. And once you get that shit,

179
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,480
you can't get rid of it. Now, remember, they have more problems with agriculture, uh,

180
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,080
particularly foot mouth disease, uh, and, uh, and, uh, NBC, uh, mad cow disease, all those kind of stuff

181
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,240
that you just don't want happening on an island, uh, which makes imminent sense.

182
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,560
So let me see a couple of the things we had to do to get set up. Um, there was no connectivity.

183
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,320
There was no phone line. Um, uh, didn't even really, um, have any TV. There's no, uh, there was no cable.

184
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,800
Uh, cable is not, um, a big thing in the UK. Although it is around, hold on a second.

185
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,040
Just wanted to reset my, uh, audio hijack there. Um, so no cable in this area, although I,

186
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,240
case you can't get it if you want. Everyone basically has, uh, satellite TV sky is, uh,

187
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,360
is the big, uh, the big satellite provider. Except just recently, they came out with this new thing

188
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,360
called free view, which is free to air digital television. Let me see if I can explain this.

189
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,520
And so essentially, they still, um, you know, use areas and tennis and those one here, uh,

190
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,320
not on the roof, but uh, in the attic. Uh, so it gets a good enough signal to receive BBC

191
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,240
1 and BBC 2. And I think you can get Channel 4. There are three commercial stations,

192
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,120
ITV, Channel 4, and, uh, Channel 5. Um, and if you're in the right area in your antennas,

193
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,240
pointing the right direction, you can pick that up. What this free view is, and this is really cool.

194
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,280
It's, uh, basically you can buy a box, you buy it one, one off box for $40.

195
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,680
And you hook it up to your existing antenna. And what it does is it then goes and brings in

196
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,200
digital signal, which are being broadcast by the same TV transmitters that are broadcasting the

197
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,040
analog signal. Of course, only now you're talking 60 channels that are coming in free to air coming

198
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:23,000
right into this digital box. It's a great digital picture, great digital sound quality. And the only

199
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,400
things that you don't get, like the porn channel, you have to pay for extra. If you want an

200
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,720
MTV, it has to pay for that extra. If you want the, uh, Turner classic movies, you should pay extra

201
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,640
for that. But that's about it. All the rest is already on there. They've got sports. They got,

202
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:44,840
oh, there's no CNN, but, all right. So we've got, uh, BBC News 24. We've got Sky News. We've got,

203
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,720
uh, two other news channels. Because it's digital, there's that they even have a special setting

204
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,960
where you click it, and then it shows you four, um, news broadcasts at the simultaneously,

205
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,440
with the sound and the picture muted, except for the one you have highlighted. I mean, just amazing

206
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,760
shit. And then if you want to, you know, if you want to unlock any of these channels, it's just a phone

207
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,520
call. And then the, you know, given their, essentially your device is, uh, address number or whatever,

208
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,720
you know, like it's almost like a MAC address on, uh, on an Ethernet card. And, uh, and it'll open

209
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,800
it up. And you just take by credit card, every one of pay. And if you stop paying, it won't, uh, give

210
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,440
you that channel. So totally amazing. It really blew me away because, you know, there's no satellite

211
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,800
dish to put up. There's no, yeah, just none of that stuff. It's seem like there's so incredible

212
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,760
easy and so plug and play. It's just a slim little device that sits on the top. And it's like

213
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,920
antenna in antenna out. Power, boom, it's got a remote, and it works unbelievable. And have to say

214
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,240
the same for British telecom for the, for the phone system. We didn't have a, well, I thought we had a

215
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,520
phone line. I thought we had our phone number, although the previous, uh, tenant had basically

216
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,480
moved that number with them when they left. So I had to go to the neighbors, nice neighbors,

217
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,200
by the way, Jimmy, my neighbor here, he was a retired accountant. And, um, and so I used this phone

218
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,000
I called him and within, you know, I got through, I got to a real-life person with only had to go

219
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,080
through 10 menus, which is not bad. Um, and, you know, I explained the situation within 15 minutes,

220
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,800
our phone line was connected. It was rockin' ready to go. Um, couldn't order the, uh, VT broad

221
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,080
band just yet because after waiting till Monday to all the billing system cycle through. Um, so I

222
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,920
broke out the airport extreme, uh, got myself a dial up account, um, and just plug it into the wall,

223
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:39,560
which means I can basically, um, if no one's using the phone, uh, Christine and I can get online

224
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,000
do a little bit of email. I let my mail run pretty much for about two hours, uh,

225
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,480
last night just to get all the, uh, all the spam and filters and everything.

226
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,520
I can see that there's probably about 300 megs worth of audio comments that people have sent me,

227
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,800
um, that of course I couldn't download via telephone while I could, but I decided not to.

228
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,720
So when this is done, I'm going to go into town. It's just five minutes drive. I can actually stay

229
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,280
in the car to pick up the Wi-Fi, uh, and I should be able to, um, uh, upload, uh, from the car later on tonight.

230
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,720
So I'll probably go around 10 30 11 o'clock. Um, so I was really pleased with the phone.

231
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,280
And it's just all these options and it's, uh, you know, it's advanced, man. They really got their

232
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,360
technology down here. In fact, now I'm going for the cell phones. And of course, you need,

233
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,320
and unless you want to do a, a pay as you go and I'd rather just pay on a monthly contract, uh, we,

234
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,560
you know, our bank is still, uh, we got a retail bank here. So we're just getting an account open there.

235
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,760
Well, we need all that stuff to, um, to get the cell phones, but they've got, um, uh, third generation

236
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,240
not GPRS, but actually UMTS with voter phone live, uh, and, you know, you pay nothing between

237
00:21:51,240 --> 00:22:01,560
handsets if you're on the same network. Excuse me. Damn. That's better. Um, but, uh, you can do

238
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,120
a video chat right from your mobile. And it really works. So, uh, I'm going to get those.

239
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,320
It's going to get three handsets for sure so that we can all be very cool together. Uh, the

240
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,840
same time I'm getting the BT broadband, which gives you, uh, voice over IP phone line in addition to

241
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,160
the one you already have, uh, I'm vibing, man. Just totally love the technology they've got going on

242
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,120
here. And it's all in English, by the way. In case you hadn't noticed. So, I don't know, is this,

243
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,600
uh, I wonder how this microphone sounds. I, it sounds like I'm probably getting a more intimate

244
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,280
feel than, uh, well, actually I'm going to switch over. Let's, let's listen to the

245
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,960
other mic for a second. Hold on. Okay. So, this is, uh, the one that you used to,

246
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,200
this is the love microphone. I'm going to use that to actually, why don't we do that now

247
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,000
since I'm wearing it? Uh, what do we have? 22 minutes. Damn, I've been yapping away.

248
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,720
So, we'll just, uh, do a quick little, uh, tour. My, um, study overlooks the front of the house.

249
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:07,320
Lucy, if I open up the window, is any? No, wind it all tonight. It was kind of stormy.

250
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,400
It was a bit stormy last night and it snowed a little bit.

251
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:21,640
So, let me just, let's go out here. So, this is, um, the hallway of the top. This is, uh,

252
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,320
our bedroom. You can hear the acoustics a little bit. Let's see, Christina's probably in her room.

253
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,920
No, I guess she's not, let me see. Nope. So, walk downstairs.

254
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,120
Christina's got the TV crank and that's what's going on.

255
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,600
Hello. I'm recording. I'm recording for the show. I'm recording for the show. I'm recording for the show

256
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,320
doing a tour of the house. What's this? Is it loud enough? We're all dead.

257
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,560
Is it loud enough? What is this? Is this, like idols?

258
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,520
Each, each jewelry member has several legs.

259
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:28,040
Oh, okay. All right. Okay. And now let's go out to the good show. Very good show.

260
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,680
Okay. Good. I'm just going to walk around to a little tour.

261
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,840
Oh, Sharon looks great. Excellent. Okay. New reality show on here.

262
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,480
So, this is the central hall. The dining room to your left.

263
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,200
Study right ahead. That says to be the TV hangout. Now we're in the kitchen. Kitchen is absolutely

264
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,960
phenomenal. Very happy with this kitchen. You know what? I'll just grab a coat and we'll go out for a

265
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:04,440
quick walk. Hold on a second. Okay. Here we go.

266
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay. We'll do as we'll go out the back way. Okay. What I maybe I should put the mic

267
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:30,120
on the outside of the cup will be better. Okay. All right. This is the back.

268
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:38,040
Now what I'll do is I'm going to walk all the way out the back yard.

269
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Let's see if we can pick up some cool sounds from what they call the downs. The downs is essentially

270
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,280
about 50 miles of land between here and the coast that is nature.

271
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:11,800
Okay. Some ramen at the gate. I hear a little bit there. Someone's got a

272
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,080
kind of machine running. Okay. Now we're walking back towards the house. It actually looks pretty

273
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:31,560
nice. I haven't seen it in the dark. Looks cozy. Go around the side. Out to the front.

274
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,320
And then from the front back in. It's dark here.

275
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,080
Mind your step. I should have a life clicking on here. Yeah. There we go. Okay.

276
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:59,800
Right. So now I'm at the garage. Here's the Audi walking down the driveway. It's a nice

277
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:16,920
cold sack with the end of it. Here a plane in the distance. Why not? Nothing with that plane.

278
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,720
And it's cold. Just about freezing point.

279
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:29,080
Okay. Let's go back in. Kind of get my bearings here myself.

280
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,520
So obviously we're not going to be doing a regular source code today where

281
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:43,720
play all kinds of cool clips and comments. That door's locked. But we will do that starting Monday.

282
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,440
And hopefully I'll have some kind of real connectivity here in midweek or maybe the end of the week.

283
00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:03,880
Back in. Yeah. Okay. Reposition the mic. Go V.

284
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:19,640
Got really cold out. That's one thing. The weather is of course not going to be any better.

285
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,880
And then Belgium. But still I do get the plug in the phone line here. It's like

286
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:38,040
going online if I want to. Cool. Okay. I have the feeling that the

287
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,280
that it's somehow brighter. I don't know what it is. Well actually it probably is because we're

288
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,840
different altitude. There's actually hills, foot hills. You know, terrain here in the UK is

289
00:28:50,840 --> 00:29:01,400
opposed to Holland, which is not only flat, but about 10 feet under sea level. Okay. Back up I presume

290
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,280
the mic picked that up all the way through. Let me just switch microphones. There we go.

291
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:22,840
Turn that one off. Perfect. So. All righty. So we're, what are we? 29 minutes into it. By the way,

292
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:31,800
even though I'm pancing, Don, you'll know, still haven't smoked. Yeah. Don has really helped me

293
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:38,040
with that. At least tobacco. And quite honestly I haven't smoked anything. I've only been

294
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,520
doing one split for day, just at night. Around this, this is about my time, you know, 10 minutes

295
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:49,000
to 10. So I'm pretty proud of myself, whereas, oh, that's been times in my life where I'd wake up at

296
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,480
you know, seven o'clock and have a nice little joint there with tobacco and with weeds. So I'm

297
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:03,000
really trying to work on my health. By the time you hear me this time next year won't be pancing as

298
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,600
okay. Let me see. What else do we have going on? The town is great. It's great being unknown.

299
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:19,720
It is absolutely fantastic because I can really be myself without being self conscious of people knowing,

300
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,760
you know, who I am, what I'm doing or, you know, if I make a joke, then people just take me at

301
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,360
phase value, not because I'm some, you know, some guy from TV. Now that by the way, may change

302
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,840
slightly as Thursday, you're not going to believe this. They called the BBC, we're freaking out.

303
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,400
So they wanted to, I told you the tape to got messed up of what they did at the castle.

304
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,000
So they then they wanted to do it at our place on Friday. Yesterday and I said, you know,

305
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,040
no way. It just can't be done. You know, we're too busy. Patricia's going to kill me.

306
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,560
Even if you don't show up, it's just too much moving going on. And they want to know if I

307
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,760
could come into London. I said, no, absolutely not. I can't come into London.

308
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,840
You know, you guys have to come here. So we kind of had it all set up for Friday. And then the

309
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,280
technicians at the BBC figured out how to get the the tapes working again. So I guess they can

310
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,120
be able to edit a piece after all. And it'll be on on the BBC on BBC 2 on the culture show.

311
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,800
This coming Thursday at 7 30 local time. And you can watch an archive of the show on

312
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:35,240
on the website at cbc.co.uk slash culture show. I believe I'll put a link up to it.

313
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,080
And I guess now that we have such good digital reception, I could probably get one of those

314
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,960
digital video recorders and record an impact myself. So yeah, I'll see if I can do that. Otherwise,

315
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,640
I'm sure someone will record it for us. And hopefully it'll turn out okay.

316
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,120
Hey, listen, I've been doing this for about 31 minutes now. So I was not to completely bore you out of

317
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,600
your skull. Well, I know we call it a day. And on Monday, hopefully I'll be able to bring you a

318
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,240
a regular source code with all the clips and bits and everything that you use to. So thank you very

319
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:17,000
much for your patience and for tuning into the source code. It's was your daily source code where

320
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,400
users and developers party together no matter what country we're in or what continent.

321
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,920
For Saturday, November 20th, 2004, 10 minutes to 10 and I am going to get out of here. Of course,

322
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,960
you can always leave your comments at adamantcurry.com or at live.curry.com. I webloor.

323
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,240
And for all the latest source codes and the archives, it's daily source code dot com. And of course,

324
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:47,080
the RSS 2.0 podcast feed is daily source code dot com slash RSS dot XML.

325
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,840
I will talk to you, Monday. Once again, from Curry Cottage in the UK,

326
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,160
until then, take it easy to get a good weekend. Bye bye.
