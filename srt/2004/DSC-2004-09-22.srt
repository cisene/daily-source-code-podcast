1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Well, howdy everybody.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Your source code coming to you from Curry Castle in Belgium.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
My name's Adam Carr...

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll say Thursday the 23rd because it's 14th.

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
A PAID SPEAKING

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
of the radio show, the morning radio show stopping.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I knew that I wanted to get out of the house.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And also, you know, that's for the best.

9
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Any regular stuff is for gas or should I say for a one jet fuel to be precise

10
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
So that was at the World Trade Center in Rotterdam and

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you've ever been to Rotterdam, it is such a beautiful city, a city that was completely

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
utterly destroyed and flattened in the Second World War.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There was just nothing left over and they rebuilt the entire city and they actually called it

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
And they call it Manhattan on the mass.

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
So Manhattan of the mass.

16
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And it does look very much like, a bit like Manhattan with the big beautiful buildings

17
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
and any of the harbor in the distance.

18
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:03,500
They've got the Europe.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and seeing that, because I don't get to Rotterdam very often.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it was a speaking engagement for,

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
this was for insurance agents of Stuttel-Tedon-Persakeningen,

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
so that's the name of the insurance company,

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and it's about 400 people there,

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and they split off into individual parallel sessions

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
around 230, and that's where I did a session.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
there and do your thing and talk and I rarely use a projector or slides although I try to

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
put some multimedia stuff into it. If I use a slide on the screen it'll be like a home

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
movie or

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
to accentuate a point. It's never text. I can't stand it when you've got someone speaking

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,500
to you and then you're being distracted by text. And of course, this is quite the opposite

31
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,500
from what BloggerCon will be, which is November 6th in Palo Alto. This is the third BloggerCon

32
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,500
and you can hear more about that on Trade Secrets, which is the brand new show on the podcasting

33
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,500
platform that I do with Dave Weiner, Dave from Scripting News, Scripting.com.

34
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:34,500
And we did another show today. We had agreed to do one at 8am his time and somehow, and it's

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,500
probably my fault. You just get so confused after a while with time zones and getting up early and

36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
then my whole rhythm is still out of whack from getting up at 3.30 every single morning for a year.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Somehow I'd messed it up and David had been waiting for me to dial into him 24 hours ago.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Luckily he didn't wait for the full 24 hours, he did find something else to do.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So we finally hooked up and we recorded a show today.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was much happier with the quality of the sound.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now in fact, even Dave sounds a little bit too loud.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'd listen back to the show, I'd check that out after we recorded it.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And his levels may be a little bit too hot compared to mine now.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But it worked pretty well and I was able to route audio back to him.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Although I think I mis-routed something and sent something back so hard through an audio loop

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that it probably made the song of the day on Trade Secrets sound like it was tripled or quadrupled.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh well, luckily it was a remix of Sting's Russians anyway.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So no real harm done probably.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh boy, I'm just totally wrecked. I'm so tired from doing all that

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because I didn't get back until QoRt-ed.

51
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,500
6 and I you know so that was 9 a.m Seattle time so I quickly through the laptop to get

52
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I got everything ready and set it all up.

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Oh what am I getting here a warning?

54
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Oh no.

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Oh this is nice.

56
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Folder actions alert.

57
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
One new item has been placed in folder iPodrx download.

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Would you like to view the added items?

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,500
No not now.

60
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Oh boy, there's more items coming in.

61
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
That is the iPod or X running in the background.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Running happily, I have to say.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's good news.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So we had to get the call set up.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now remember we're doing this voiceover IP, which means that I'm doing it on iChat, which

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
is Apple's instant message client.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And it's the iChat AV so you can do audio and video.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And Dave's using AOL, he's using AIM, he's using the Windows client.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And you know that was all right because certainly if you compare it to the first show we

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
did where we literally had to stop and retape sometimes just minutes worth but

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
at one point almost half an hour's worth of it.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
it kills your energy. So the energy was much better now. We didn't have to really do anything.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
His sound was clipping once in a while, but all things considered, I think it's pretty

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
damn good and you can't beat the price. Now, let's be honest, you just can't beat that.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So it's a long show. It's about an hour and 20 minutes and you can see that you can

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
listen to it. It's secrets.scripting.com. It's trade secrets and maybe in the next

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
week show, we'll explain to you what that title really means and where it came from.

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was thinking maybe we'd just take a, since it's such a, you know, it's so late and I

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
haven't done a source code. I don't think I've done a source code at this hour.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We'll just take a quick step outside. Hold on a second. We go. Just to get a little vibe.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hold on a second. It is raining. Let me just get the umbrella. Just take a quick evening stroll.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
around the back courtyard.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now actually it's harvest time.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, there's a little froggy.

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hello frog.

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I almost stepped on him.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's harvest time.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And particularly now that all the rains are coming,

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the farmers that have the lands all surrounding our grounds

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
are harvesting.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And they do this almost 24 hours a day non-stop.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's really time is money kind of deal.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I heard him, up until about half an hour ago,

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I heard him buzz and buy with the tractor

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so we may hear him.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now I'm about, let's see,

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I say I'm about 50 yards from the receiving end of this.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So I presume that that's still working.

99
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Sorry, I'm taking a sip of my drink there.

100
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I got a humongous flame of comment on DailySourceCode.com.

101
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Someone was unsubscribing from my feed.

102
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,500
He couldn't stand listening to me slurping on my drink as I did these shows.

103
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Unsubscribed forever, he said.

104
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Well, that's your right.

105
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
That's what it's all about.

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
You know, it's not like a mailing list where you can't get off.

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
You know, that's what RSS does so beautifully.

108
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
If you're sick and tired.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
arrangement you just unsubscribe okay nothing going on much tonight oh I also

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
got a note from Pete Prodell oh god I hope I pronounce it right now I can't I'm

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
too afraid to open up my email client while I'm recording stuff I thought it

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
was Prodell Prodell right Prodell raster web audio you know the guy who who I

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
mentioned yesterday when I was talking we were talking about short content and

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
comedy bits check out his latest offering this is raster web audio for

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
September 22nd 2004 slightly after mid-autopathy could be the weather in

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Montclair New Jersey the current conditions for Montclair New Jersey it's

117
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
currently fair with a temperature of 58 degrees the dew point is 56 humidity is

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
93 visibility is around 10 miles and the winds are calm thank you and good

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
night thank you Pete wonderful I'm telling you

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I would subscribe to a feed that does that.

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
I absolutely would.

122
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
We've actually been discussing him doing some other kind of feed,

123
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
like maybe a joke of the day, which is great.

124
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
And I will promote it and I'll certainly play his joke of the day a couple times.

125
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
But then the whole point is you subscribe to it, you know,

126
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,500
and then in the morning as you're listening to the latest shows

127
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
that came down the pike or whenever you have a chance to listen to it

128
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
on your walk or while you're jogging or you're down time, you're uptown,

129
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
you're in your sleep time, whatever,

130
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
and you'll just automatically hit it.

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
And it'll be in between shows, you know,

132
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
maybe morning coffee notes or trade secrets or evil genius chronicles

133
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
and then a joke of the day and then a source code

134
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
and that way you really start to tivoize your experience.

135
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Oh man, this iPod or X is just going nuts.

136
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
It's giving me all kinds of content.

137
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I subscribed to the...

138
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Oh, that was so beautiful.

139
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
We got a couple of feeds from Feedster,

140
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Scott Johnson had set that up for us,

141
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,500
even set up a whole webpage saying, you know, here's my gift to you.

142
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
And I just said, well, give me some picture enclosures.

143
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I want to see how many come in, which apparently is quite a lot.

144
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
And I did see noise, or not noise, I saw signal to noise

145
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
on the iPod or developer list that were, you know,

146
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
there's talk of putting in either a, you know,

147
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,500
do not download more than X items or, yeah,

148
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
or enclosures for each feed,

149
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
especially when you subscribe to a new one

150
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
because that can really screw up your machine,

151
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
your processing, your power.

152
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
And for any newbie who's just installing it,

153
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
it's kind of daunting, you know, like you.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The fan is worrying, I've got files popping up all over the place.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It can be kind of scary.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me see, I'm just fried.

157
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I apologize, normally I've got my energy up.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You know what, maybe this will help.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's play a song of the day.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is something that...

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not safe or worse put it that way, but it's it's music to walk in

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The dark clouded sky, silt with rain, with turdward dew.

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Everybody's fucking but me.

164
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I just can't sing.

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Some girls even bought you

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And they just seem to trade

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I can't

168
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:17,500
A dazzling urban eyes like me

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:36,000
My pussy's useful only when I eat

170
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
But he's fucking...

171
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
But...

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
dying of terminalized.

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
so depressing to see

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
my flum and cuss

175
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
That's it.

176
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,500
My secular is the blooming

177
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Even my door

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I guess I just don't have a plan.

179
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Last four guys behind every tree

180
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:11,500
It's just a pain in the ass

181
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,500
The man just sings a dark free

182
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,500
I will stay like a stupid

183
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And fuck me

184
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Everybody's fucking

185
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Honey

186
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Everybody

187
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I'll tell you, I'll say for work.

188
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Isn't it beautiful though?

189
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Got a whole album.

190
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
If you'd like it, let me know.

191
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I'll certainly play more.

192
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I wanted to wrap up today's source code too

193
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
with a little bit of feedback for the Audio Hijack Pro guys

194
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
from Amoeba Software.

195
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
And I know that some of them listen to the source code

196
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
and actually got an email saying,

197
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,500
you know, we also, we're trying to build this application

198
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
into something that works for audio blogging

199
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
and give us some feedback.

200
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
And I'll tell you, I love this application.

201
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I love this program.

202
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
It works extremely well for what I'm trying to make it do.

203
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
If it were possible to improve anything,

204
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
what would make it the most ultimate,

205
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
fabulous, fantastic tool?

206
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Would be, you know how on the effects pane,

207
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
so basically for, you know, you can hijack the audio

208
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
from any application.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the effects page, what I'd love, you know, because you can set in all kinds of effects

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and filters and you can route audio through from one filter to another. Wouldn't it be

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
beautiful if I could either A, route the audio from the effects pane to another recording,

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
right? Or if I could select several applications that I want to record at the same time and

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
then have them all record into one file, because currently I can record four out of

214
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
four or five, you know, as many applications theoretically as I want at the

215
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
same time, except I can only record them to separate files. So if there's any way to

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
integrate, primarily the microphone, that's the most important part is being

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
able to mix in the microphone with the general signal coming off of off of the

218
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the main, the core audio driver. Just being able to do that would be absolutely

219
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
phenomenal. I don't even know if it's possible. I've been getting a lot of

220
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
emails that in the next version of the Mac OS, what is that, Tiger or whatever.

221
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, it's Tiger.

222
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,500
that there will be a lot more, there will be many improvements to the core audio drivers and

223
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,500
ways to mix the signals and all kinds of APIs and stuff that developers can get into.

224
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,500
So hopefully, Dave and I also talked a bit about this on trade secrets and the Apple guys,

225
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I love them man, they're always right there when I need something.

226
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
you can. They're just not quite thinking about this yet, but hopefully they'll catch this

227
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
on the source code and if anyone wants to give me a call and pick my brain about it,

228
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll be happy to let you know because if we can get this to work reliably, then it's great.

229
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then anyone can have a full blown audio or radio production studio on your desktop. No need for

230
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
breakout boxes and external devices or

231
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Maybe not all the hardware we need to make it work perfectly, but something more should

232
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
be possible than the results I'm achieving right now.

233
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Okay, oh, I almost forgot to tell you the really good news.

234
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Patricia called.

235
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
She and her sister have been in London or England for the past couple of days.

236
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
And we have a house.

237
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
She found a house.

238
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
She cut a deal.

239
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Or at least I think she made an offer.

240
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And I think that'll be accepted.

241
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Which means we'll be moving somewhere I guess before Christmas.

242
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
So I'm very pumped about that.

243
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
And I've actually only really seen a picture of the house on the internet.

244
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
And Patricia took the video camera.

245
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500
So by tomorrow afternoon, I'll have seen it.

246
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
And maybe I'll be able to let you know a little bit more about the new digs.

247
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Okay, I'd say that's about all I can muster up today.

248
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Still have to get this up to the server.

249
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
And since I'm still Mr. Mom, I've got to close down.

250
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Also got to clean up some of the kitchen, get the dishwasher going, make sure all the animals

251
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The animals are secure, the house is secure, you know, make sure Jim Bob, Mario and Sue

252
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Elnor all in bed.

253
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,500
And that's it for Shows Code for today.

254
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's dailysourcecon.com.rss.xml.

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll see you tomorrow for another video.
