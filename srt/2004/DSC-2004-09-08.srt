00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Once again, it's the Source Code. Good evening from Belgium, from Curry Castle, or good afternoon,

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or good morning wherever you're happy to be checking in from. Thank you very much for

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
tuning in for downloading the Daily Source Code, always available. The archives are

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
DailySourceCode.com and of course you can subscribe through your RSS 2.0

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
enclosure compatible news reader. Man, that's a mouthful. It's DailySourceCode.com

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
slash RSS.XML. So the source code for today, a lot of today was spent driving.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Patricia and I came back from Amsterdam, her mouth operated on, which is a never-ending story.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Not everyone has a stand at the front of the perfect teeth line.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Man, we've really done a lot of work on her mouth.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Anyway, so that was a little less fun for her, but I had a reason to be relaxed day, just

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
chilling out, visited a couple people while I was in the city.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,500
And I wanted to focus on a couple of things on SourceCo today.

13
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
First of all, man, talk about users and developers partying, in this case not partying, maybe

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
crying together.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Murphy really hit hard on the Genesis space capsule that crash landed in the Utah

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Desert.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I was just thinking that.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
It's so typical.

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
You know, here they were, they had worked this thing out with, I guess it was Hollywood

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:43,500
stunt helicopter pilots who were going to string a net between two helicopters to catch the

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,500
capsule as it floated down on its parachute and then to bring it down to an ultimate

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
soft landing.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,500
And of course, everyone was really concentrated on the helicopter pilots and, you know, were

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,500
they going to be able to catch this disc falling out of space and how fast would it be going?

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
And that also has potential.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
dangers you know if you have just imagine two helicopters with a net strung between it if

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
something hits it too hard it's going to pull those helicopters together and of course then there's

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
all kinds of stuff you don't copter pilot like sheets and wires known as a parachute but then

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
of course I was concentrating on that and no one really probably thought you know hey maybe the

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
parachute would deploy you know that's technology that we've had for for 70 years and no one figured

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that would fail so it's really sad that that happened and I guess they can't get any samples

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
or everything's useless because of the contamination and the disc really hit hard I don't know if you've

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
seen a picture I'll be sure to link to one on my blog but man that was rough for them.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's talk briefly about iPodder I think yesterday I mentioned that there was a

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
cocoa version on the way as well as I guess yet another windows version and there was just

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Peter just updated the windows version.

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,500
today very cool now it supports apples aac files it automatically detects whether

38
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
you're running Windows Media Player or iTunes and basically does everything else

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,500
for you so that's perfect all we need to do now and now put my user hat on is we

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
need to create really one-click installers this is something that is

41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
often you know just added the very last moment of the process I've noticed

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,500
even on my own iPod or script you still have to download the XML to tools or

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,500
yeah that's what I call XML to tools and you have to install that into your

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,500
into your library folders so that's that's a real pain and really that also

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
happened by itself so I'm hoping now that everyone who's made a version of

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,500
iPod and I'll make concerted effort myself this weekend to create an

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
installer so basically you just double click on something and it installs

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,500
everything now here's the final the final piece that no one has really done

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And I think I know how I can get it to work on the Mac,

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is we have to have a cron job running.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We have to have a timed operation of iPod,

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
or preferably at night.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Or see, I have mine set up at four times a day, which

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
actually is too much, probably, because at a certain point,

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
during the afternoon, then the script will kick in

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
through a timed cron job.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And it does really sometimes noticeably slow down

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the performance.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, certainly the performance of my internet connection,

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
depending on how big the files are that I'm sucking in.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So somehow I need to make that automatic as well.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And of course, we have to have an uninstall set up,

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
or if someone wants to change the times when it runs,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that would be perfect.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So that's the final thing we need.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And then I believe that we have the receiving side all set.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And then I'm going to start talking about how we move this

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
a little bit further.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not quite sure what we need to do first.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do we need to work on the publishing side, which

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
could be a much bigger project than the iPod?

72
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:18,500
receiving side or do we want to perhaps look at the distribution side which may even be

73
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,500
smarter because my feeling is that we might want to look at instead of uploading mp3 files

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,500
to servers at integrating BitTorrent into this. I've noticed that BitTorrent works really

75
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
well when something's fresh and everybody wants to have it because everyone's out

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,500
there clicking the download link of course it's always going to be one link

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
right there's always gonna be your your your first node which presumably will be

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
your own computer and then the minute other people hit lock on then you have

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
more peers to connect to and thus more people can download it and that really

80
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
works that was it they call file swarming technology it I think it

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
really works well with the with stuff that's fresh and new so it would

82
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
probably be perfect for programs like this so then of course we'd run up and

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,500
do a couple other things you know so

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
well you can imagine

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and all the things we're going to run into.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I do believe that BitTorrent has a spot in this iPod platform.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And of course, if we can successfully implement the iPod system of bringing in files,

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
bringing in enclosed files, and then instead of bringing them in from a web server somewhere,

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
actually have it work through BitTorrent, I think we'll be setting ourselves up perfectly for the next step,

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
which is quite a ways off, I think, but that will be, eventually will be video,

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and we'll probably do it the same way and BitTorrent seems to work great with big video files.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So that's just some stuff to think about.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Because one thing we're missing, we're missing good audio feeds with enclosures.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I mean, they are out there. There's lots of people doing audio blog posts,

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but just not enough for integrating them into their RSS feeds.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So that's the other side of me thinking maybe we need to work on some kind of publishing system,

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but just food for thought, I hope.

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
by Monday to have had enough feedback from folks and figure out which way we

99
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,500
should go with this. I did catch a couple interesting bits across the net on the

100
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
iPod or I love the blog digger MP3 feed. It brings in just it's the most

101
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,500
serendipitous part of my experience is whatever that brings in and I actually

102
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,500
caught this one guy before and this is his latest, well I guess it's

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:47,500
kind of like an advertisement in the form of a audio blog post and he's got a

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
business model and I think you should listen to it only lasts about a minute or

105
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
so but you know get your pen and paper handy because you're gonna want to

106
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,500
write down these URLs. Check out this Internet Guru. Welcome to volume 2

107
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
number 36 September 7th 2004 edition of current awareness happening John the

108
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Internet. Your truly Marcus P. Zellman. This week's edition will be discussing

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
RSS Rich Sight Services. It's a site that

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we all need to take a look at.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It is a categorization registry of library services

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that are delivered or provided to RSS slash XML

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to be delivered to Adam or other types of web feeds.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
RSS is the initialism for RDF site summary,

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
rich site summary, really simple syndication,

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
depending upon which nomenclature you are using.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And in general, for each entry,

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the home institutional library is listed

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and is hot linked entry for the item.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
When available, a link of the RSS feed

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
or an associated information page is also provided.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000

Library and Ames, Iowa.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is a terrific site when it comes to looking

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
at various rich site services,

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it has information about administrative and...

129
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
announcements, acquisitions, cataloging, circulation, collection development, databases, instruction,

130
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,500
interlibrary loan, internet resources guides, new books, new journal issues, news, online

131
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:33,500
public access catalogs, reference services, table of contents, and a general bibliography.

132
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Greats align.

133
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,500
You need to take time to bookmark this site and go through and take a look at all of

134
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
the great resources that are available from this site.

135
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Now, give us the URL.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,500
This has been volume 2, number 36, September 7, 2004, edition of Current Awareness Happens

137
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
on the Internet.

138
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Current Awareness Happens on the Internet.

139
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Spotted by eCurrent Awareness Resources 2004-5, offering you a 41-page business intelligence

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
research.

141
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
And he just keeps going on and on and on and on.

142
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
But interesting use of audio blogs.

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
I wonder if he's making any money that way.

144
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Maybe one of these days I'll be lucky enough to have him on as a guest.

145
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Something else I picked up.

146
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Now, I remember that you'll remember...

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
if you're old enough, the old CB radio days, they used to be all kinds of parody songs and

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
joke songs about CB users.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And of course, when it comes to weblogs, there's just too many analogies to go into right now

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and too many parallels between weblogs and CB radio.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And it's been mentioned many times before.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's some obvious benefits, of course, with the internet and weblogs.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But it's about that time in the life cycle of something that hits pop culture as hard as

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
weblogs have for the parody songs to come out.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And this is actually not even that bad a song if you just take it at its merit.

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Again, picked up through the blog digger media feed.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now this is something that apparently has been circulating around the internet because

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I did a Google search on it and came up with, I even came up with remixes of the

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
song, of course, typical.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Check it out, it really sounds good.

161
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Ginger, is it your Lorraine?

162
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
You're cat, doin' it again.

163
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
You post the lyrics when you listen to a song.

164
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Are you a liviant to watch it doin' wrong?

165
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Jump straight, you're gonna know

166
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Love life, tell us blow by blow

167
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
I love certain pleasing forms of what you're going to eat

168
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Without that knowledge, then my life is ain't gonna be

169
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
This is not your vlog.

170
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
This is not your vlog.

171
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
We don't wanna hang out with you.

172
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:38,500
It's hard, I am feeling blue

173
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,500
So what? Who the hell are you?

174
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,500
You are insincerity self-impact shmuck

175
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
What makes you think we're going to give up playing fuck?

176
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
This is not your vlog, this is not your vlog

177
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
If you're lonely for your mommy it's wax

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Not your vlog

179
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Very uh...

180
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,500
not your blog. Well, it's actually my mic up a little bit. It sucks. Hold on. Okay. Yeah,

181
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,500
not too bad. I kind of like that song. This is not your blog available all around the

182
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,500
internet now also in a remix version. A couple more things I want to talk about just bopping

183
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
around from topic to topic today. I picked up on a story I think Dave Weiner pointed

184
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,500
into it about Microsoft MSN radio. This is really interesting. Apparently what MSN

185
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,500
is doing is they started up a new service where they purchase the playlist information

186
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,500
of see in total. I think they have probably 1200 radio stations in the States, Canada

187
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,500
and Puerto Rico. Now you can get these you can buy these from from Nielsson broadcast

188
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,500
data systems and radio stations subscribe to these services all the time all kinds of

189
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,500
services so they can see what the competition is doing basically so it's

190
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
very it's very normal to subscribe to this. But what they're doing is they're

191
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
taking

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the playlist, not necessarily the format. I'm not quite sure if they're onto that.

193
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The format as we discussed before is what type of song you play at what part of

194
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the hour or what part of the day. In fact radio is split up into day parts.

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And they're replicating or they're attempting to replicate each radio

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
station. Let's see, there's a couple of examples here. None of them that I can

197
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
have heard of. But apparently, let's see, Oakland San Jose, KYLD, Wild 94,

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Alice 97.3, K101, Star 101, which is Star 101.3. So you have the exact same

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
music mix, presumably in more or less the same order. They're even claiming with

200
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
less repetition. Think about how they're really trying to make radio here.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Only don't have the commercials, the weather or the local community affairs,

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and of course the disc jockeys. And this is supposed to be like this huge

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
benefit. And I'm thinking, why?

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,500
call this MSN radio. They clearly do not have a... They have... There is clueless about what

205
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:43,500
radio is about as clear channel is from what I'm reading here. And there's one program

206
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:51,500
director who was quoted in this piece who actually hit it right on the head. Here we go. This

207
00:15:51,500 --> 00:16:00,500
is from John Aller's program director at KCNLFM, known there as Channel 104.9. He said, and

208
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I quote, I appreciate them calling attention to us, to those who may not

209
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
have discovered us yet, Aller said. But he added that if you're trying to take away

210
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
our listeners, the programming that makes a station's personality and connection

211
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,500
to listeners can't be duplicated by a computer. Hallelujah. That is right on the

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,500
money and absolutely true. Hold on. Let me just crank up the mic here a little

213
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:31,500
bit. And the reason for that is that radio is not just about records. Yes,

214
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
that's a very important part of it.

215
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
important part of it and that's going to bring in the age group of listeners that you're

216
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
looking for.

217
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But radio is it and I think we discussed that here before as well.

218
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Just like this is actually a kind of because you relate to an audience and you talk about

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
things that your audience is interested in and usually that's a geographic audience

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
with radio because you only can broadcast so far with your signal.

221
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So you're going to talk about local weather, local things that are going on.

222
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're going to have times to like local promotions into local retail, into concerts.

223
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, there's all this stuff.

224
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's not just about, you know, Madonna's in town and we have the concert.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We're going to promote that and we're going to play her records.

226
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's just not what it's all about.

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And it's certainly not only about we're going to play the best of the 70s, 80s

228
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and 90s without the DJs and all of a sudden that's going to work.

229
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
People really do like and need some type of human element to a radio station.

230
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Sure.

231
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Non-stop jukeboxes work still work.

232
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
very well. And there are many radio formats where there's a hell of a lot more music and

233
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,500
less talk. But still, it is even if it's the local weather report, it's absolutely critical

234
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,500
to the success of any radio station. So I'm not quite sure what MSN is trying to do.

235
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
I don't think that they're liable for anything, because I still don't think that they can

236
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
really copy the format unless they've got some radio guy working with them on this

237
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
who knows what he's doing. Because it's not easy to copy a format.

238
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,500
And formats are also something that kind of evolve on the fly. You'll often see a

239
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
program director or a music director or sometimes even a general manager just

240
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
going into the computer. The system they use, almost every radio station he uses

241
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,500
is called selector and will be manually changing things on the fly. And all the

242
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
lists are always checked. And it's something that really comes from the

243
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,500
gut more than just from a computer, at least on radio stations that I think

244
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
are really good and usually the ones doing well.

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
see that type of hands-on approach.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So interesting that they're trying to do that, but again, I think quite clueless.

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And if they're trying to market that as radio, then they're making a marketing mistake.

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Speaking of marketing, we know as, what was that, we heard the interview with Hallie and

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
David Weinberg.

250
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think it was, yeah, we said that the language of politics today is the language

251
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
of marketing.

252
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And there's another bit of marketing out there.

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know if you've seen it in the states yet.

254
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Probably it certainly, it's not airing anywhere in Europe unless you happen to

255
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
catch it on a news broadcast.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is an advertisement which was paid for by Texans for Truth.

257
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And it's very short and there's only two captions in it, two titles.

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll read those as they come on the screen.

259
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And this is basically the counter-attack of John Kerry's

260
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:45,500
about the truth or whatever the swift boat controversy of his tours in Vietnam and now

261
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:53,500
they're counter attacking on George Bush about him possibly having been AWOL himself.

262
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
So I'll read the captions off and you can listen to the audio.

263
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Was George Bush AWOL in Alabama?

264
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
George Bush was up and say I served in the 180th Civil Air National Guard in Montgomery,

265
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Alabama.

266
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Really.

267
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I mean that was my unit and I don't remember seeing you there.

268
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
So I call friends and I did you know that George served in our unit?

269
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
No, I never saw him there.

270
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Tell us whom you serve with Mr. President.

271
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,500
It would be impossible to be unseen in a unit of that size.

272
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
George Bush has some explaining to do.

273
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
There you go.

274
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
So it ends with George Bush has some explaining to do and that was, let me see, I can get

275
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
that title for you and see who that was who was speaking.

276
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Mince of the 187th Tech.

277
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
a practical squadron Air National Guard in Montgomery, Alabama.

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And he's claiming that he can't remember any George Bush and he called a couple other

279
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
people neither could they.

280
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So interesting bit of marketing.

281
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Has nothing to do with politics or the future of the United States?

282
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I guess.

283
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I think there's other more important things we'll be talking about, that's for sure.

284
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Briefly on audiobooks, one of my favorite topics.

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And here's something that I did not know.

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You probably heard of the Gutenberg Project, which you can get to through Gutenberg.net.

287
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is a collection of all literary works that have come into the public domain.

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So you can basically download the text and many are an HTML version and some even in

289
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
PDFs of some excellent, excellent books that you can just download and put on your

290
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
ebook reader or you can read it right off your screen.

291
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I've seen...

292
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Lots of times I've seen people who have used text to speech processing to try and kind of make an audio book into it.

293
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I've tried that myself a couple times and it just it just doesn't work.

294
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I mean you can't get the nuance, the human feeling, the emotion depending on what kind of book or if it's a novel or

295
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
biography you need a different approach and

296
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,500
computerize the speech synthesis, at least on the level that it's available to users today.

297
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
It's nowhere near what it needs to be. But I actually found

298
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
that there are also some folks out there who were

299
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
making these audio books free of charge and uploading them to the Gutenberg project.

300
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
And I want to give you two examples just to give you an idea of the quality

301
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,500
because the voice on the first one that I have no idea if this is homegrown or if this is maybe something a little bit

302
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,500
a little more professional. Check out this reading. I'll just give you a little piece of Sherlock Holmes.

303
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

304
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

305
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
A scandal in

306
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,000
email.

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Sherlock Holmes. She is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any

308
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
other name. In his eyes, she eclipses and predominates the whole of her say.

309
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So that's just a little bit of Sherlock Holmes. I was blown away by that speaker and I've

310
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
actually downloaded this. It's on my iPod and I will get to it because it sounds like

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that would be a pretty relaxing listen to Sherlock Holmes book. And I found that original

312
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
audio recording. It's just all kinds of audio stuff here today. And this also came

313
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:28,000
off of Gutenberg. This is an actual recording of Watson discussing the

314
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
events that unfolded and how the telephone was discovered, which of course was

315
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
done by Alexander Graham Bell. But listen to a bit of this recording. You should

316
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
listen to the whole thing. It's about six minutes long. It's a fabulous piece

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
of history. And the recording is, well, needless to say...

318
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,500
shit listen to the scratches

319
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
telegraph netizens over one wire at the same time

320
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
so just a bit there of the birth of the telephone and

321
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,500
again, both of these can be downloaded for free and they're completely

322
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
royalty and copyright free from

323
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Gutenberg net excellent resource on the internet and one of these days

324
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I am just gonna have to you know break down and actually record an entire audiobook

325
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I've been looking at a couple different ones that are read as a kid

326
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And I don't know, I just have to have got a, I wonder how long it would take.

327
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You know, I remember we did, there was a collaborative audio book effort that was done several, like,

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
well everyone took a chapter.

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There were 13 or 14 different bloggers that all read a chapter of Lawrence Lessig's book.

330
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Maybe that would be fun to start that up again or as I said, maybe I'll just do

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
one myself.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay, let's see, we're 25 minutes.

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Why don't we just round off today's source code with a song.

334
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This is one that I picked out of the iTunes library.

335
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Never can get enough Joe Walsh.

336
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Rocky Mountain Way.

337
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
I

338
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
I

339
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
SNAKE

340
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh

341
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
you

342
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
you

343
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
you

344
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I

345
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
I

346
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I

347
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Joe Walsh, Rocky Mountain Way on the source code.

348
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I was just thinking, I apologize if I sound a little discombobulated.

349
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's quarter to 11 here and I'm just tired.

350
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I got to do these things earlier, that's for sure.

351
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What we didn't talk about today was something that's pretty high in everybody's list

352
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
who's been responding, namely naming conventions for the source code.

353
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So should it be year, month, day?

354
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Should it be day, month, year?

355
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Should it be daily source code or just DSC?

356
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
All different kinds of opinions based upon.

357
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think probably different user experiences, different MP3 devices.

358
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So I'm still kind of trying to work that out in my own little world here.

359
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So for now I'm going to keep the naming.

360
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
convention as it is.

361
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,500
And I'm going to leave you with that for the source code for today.

362
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Of course, as always, if you'd like to respond, you can send email to adamantcurry.com or

363
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,500
just leave a comment on my web blog, which is located at live.curry.com.

364
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,500
This was the source code for today, September 8th, 2004.

365
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
And we'll see you tomorrow.

366
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Bye-bye.

367
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm going to leave you with that for the source code for today.
