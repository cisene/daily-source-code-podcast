1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Before we get started, let me remind you of the following results or events predicted in these things,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,000
the name of our materialism, from actual results.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,800
The factors that could cause actual events results to differ from expectations include

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
lack of growth, intense competition in our industry,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,840
integration failures, changes in government regulations,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
operational failures, or looking to take them from success.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,000
Alright, some of the volumes of today should not be relied upon as representing our

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,480
future. While we may delight something more than we say, it's a complete future.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,520
We need to not give it so even for us to change.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,320
Augustine, all's life, and a curry.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,640
Power of glory to all of us.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Hi everybody and welcome to your daily source code. It is Monday. It is November 1, 2004.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,240
Bunny Bunny, or is it rabbit rabbit? I'm just supposed to say that at the start of each new month,

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,240
and then money and good fortune will come your way. Let it be yours, my friends.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Once again, welcome to source code.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
Got a lot of good stuff lined up on the show today and I got to talk about this new production

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,120
system that I'm using. I feel so incredibly organized. I could actually almost do my nails

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,560
while recording the podcast today. Some tunes and of course some politically oriented

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,960
stuff because we are just about a day away from the elections. And we'll be looking at both sides

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,120
and we'll be letting Republicans speak on the show as well. Yeah, new concepts.

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm not going to show a long one. I'm going to run but I don't know if we're going to make it

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:49,760
40 minutes man, there's too much to do. So I'm coming to you today from Flanders, Belgium,

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,560
from Curie Castle where there is less and less of our stuff to be found. It's all packed away in boxes.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Today our brand new bed, I just decided we needed a new bed, didn't really like the one we had here,

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,720
in Belgium. We just got a shitty bed and kind of lived with it. A good bed still an Amsterdam.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
So we bought a new bed and they brought it over. We can't sleep on it right now because it's

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,320
going to be moved to the house in the UK. And man, that's what is that? It's only a little under

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:31,440
two and a half weeks away. Oops, hold on. I forgot to silence the old telephone there during

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,600
the show. So for the next 45 minutes you are in mind here on the daily source code as I said

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,640
some political stuff here as well. Might as well kick it off with the tune from the billionaires for

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,480
Bush. They say, you know what? Don't bother, don't vote. And now an important election day announcement

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:00,000
from the billionaires for Bush. I keep flashing back on why it's okay. When the billionaires

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
took your voting rights away, you can think that the felons got personal lift. A lot of innocent

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,320
people's names were dismissed. We said our road blocked on Baton November day, it caused full

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,920
of black people got turned away. So many felons were tossed out in the back of a dipwood or a hanging

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,320
chat. Down in Florida we struck a mortar blow. Cause George's brother James was running the show

37
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,920
and the Secretary of State who inflicted the fame was the chair of the Florida Bush campaign. And

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,680
a commentator recorded for George E. B. Was his cousin who been working for Fox TV. A new election

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,360
day this coming that was kind of wedding. If the billionaires keep you forgetting, maybe it's

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,400
got a better place to be. You can stay at home and watch TV. You can be kicking it with your crew.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Just let the billionaires choose for you.

42
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,720
We found a better way to make it in the same clean. We put it electronic voting machine

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,880
and then we sold these suckers nationwide. But with the only ones who know what's on the inside,

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,680
you push the buttons and a voting machine keeps track. You made it so was very easy to hack.

45
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,360
Quite for a recap of what probably felt when machines don't leave no hate to travel.

46
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,320
The billionaires don't want you to vote this year but send your message that's loud and clear

47
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,080
that the votes can't be counted in your community. Why revenge to don't waste your energy?

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't go to the polls on election day because we bought the election in the federal

49
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,240
girl all the way. And on election night we'll sit back and go. The billionaires don't want you to vote.

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,040
If you're happy with George Bush in charge, if you want to keep us living long. Do you really

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,720
want to rock the boat? Hey, the billionaires don't want you to vote. When other countries go and

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,240
have an election day, people walk across mountains that have their stay. What in life are days

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,320
until the vote begins? They sit and watch the votes are counted. They see who wins.

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,520
Here in America we put obstacles in your way. Really hoping you stay home on election day.

55
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,000
If you're all voting each one of you just off and wet, there'd be a very different government.

56
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
If you really want to fight in the world, if you like the way we're treating the poor,

57
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,280
if you don't care about education, keep the billionaires controlling the nation.

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,960
If you want to help you see, no. If you like the way the money flow, do you really want to rock the boat?

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Hey, the billionaires don't want you to vote. Billionaires, for Bush, don't vote on your daily

60
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,680
source code. I don't know where that came from. I supposed to pick that up on the blog digger feed,

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,800
but it's been floating out there. I'm seeing more and more of this, these surprises pop along,

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,440
that's just like the John Stewart interview on Crossfire on CNN. You didn't really have to

63
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,040
subscribe to any particular feed to receive that digger. That popped up just about everybody everywhere.

64
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,560
I've got some more John Stewart on the way today on the show on the source code.

65
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,880
The weekend was a little bit messed up. No Gilmore gang. You know, my weekend just doesn't feel

66
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,760
right. If I don't have a Gilmore gang to listen to on Saturday or Sunday. And as I've said before,

67
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,760
you know, when I don't get a Gilmore gang, I used to go and immediately start debugging my iPod or

68
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,960
scripts. Now I know better and I know to go and check out the IT Conversations.com website. So

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,480
nothing there unfortunately. I did just see just before I started the show. I see that the behind

70
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,320
the mic series with Dave Weiner came out. So I can't wait to listen to that. I'll have comments and

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,960
hopefully some expert excerpts from that tomorrow on the show. And during the The Billionaires

72
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,160
for Bush clip that I played, like everyone that I wanted to talk to today started calling,

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360
so I've just put the phone on silent and have to make the calls when I get back or when I've

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:03,680
done and I'm back on the phones. See, I was also talking to Dave Weiner. He also has a real problem

75
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,920
with the Gilmore gang not showing up. And I said, wait, this is a big part of what differentiates

76
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,640
a audio blog post from a podcast. You know, podcast, you're making a commitment. You're saying

77
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,480
to your audience and even if that's one person or if that's, you know, 10,000 people or 100,000

78
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,320
doesn't matter, you're making a commitment that you're going to do something. And people will

79
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,520
become dependent upon that. So if you want to do a podcast and you're going to have to pretty

80
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,440
much, you know, make the effort to have something up every single time, you know, that it's

81
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,960
supposed to be up. So if it's a Friday show, like the Gilmore gang, you know, even if it's just a

82
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,920
one minute piece of audio, the show that my aggregator kicks in, you know, my iPod or picks it up

83
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,760
and I can hear, you know, hey guys, sorry, you know, Gilmore gang today. In lieu of that, here's

84
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,600
his one, you know, from the archives. Here's the best of. And so I've been coaching Dave a bit

85
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
because he's been basically doing audio blog posts and I said, you know, one chip really

86
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,240
call it a podcast and let's work on a tune and get some stuff going. And when I'm out in

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,760
in San Francisco, I want to help him set up some software and show him how I do these things

88
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,080
live and on the fly because it's a lot easier to do him live than it is to go back and edit

89
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
stuff in, which I know a lot of people are doing. They will make that a part of the session at

90
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,160
blogger con. So looking forward to the more coffee notes more regularly, we love being regular with

91
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,560
morning coffee notes. Stroke in time. Yes, a message from Todd. Listen to this.

92
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,480
Hey, they're Adam. This is Todd. I just wanted to drop a note and say how great the interplay

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,760
between your show and the Don and Drew show has been. In fact, I can't really think of any

94
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,040
other shows or mediums where we get this kind of interplay or I might be kind of unique to podcasting

95
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,000
at the moment. At any rate, you guys are amazing. I don't know what I do without your

96
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,400
wit and cynicism every day. I keep up the great, great work. Wait, listen.

97
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah, Todd, got one back for you, buddy. Here it comes. I've been receiving so many

98
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,400
boring sounds from so many people is just awesome. And what do you think of that new opener, huh?

99
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,800
Of the show? I found a new podcast, the earningscast at earningscast.com and that was actually

100
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,400
a part of, I think, the double click disclaimer that you have to do in front of every earnings conference

101
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,720
call forward looking statements, et cetera. I just kind of messed around with it and garage band

102
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,360
and mixed in some music and cutting my opening sweeper and the rock money off power of pure

103
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,240
intellect stuff. But the Buying's, man, that's just been too many of them. They had them.

104
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,200
I still rise to Bill Rice.org. I just wanted to give a quick shout and make a request. I'm sure

105
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,280
several of your faithful listeners like the self-reface and the lengthy flight of the water

106
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,840
time. I wonder if the youth through the daily source code or maybe you and Dave through trade

107
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,960
seekers could give us a special travel addition to these programs. Help us pass the time and maybe

108
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,960
we could even pass it along to others as we evangelize along our pillar of the doubt to

109
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,120
the call. I also wanted to quickly express my concern, prayers and hope to your mother and your

110
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,800
family. It sounds like things are progressing positively and I hope that I continue blessing.

111
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,840
And finally, I know your mantra has been what programmers and users parted together but I thought

112
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,360
to consider an important part on the immediately after the president's election. It might also

113
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,080
be appropriate to consider the possibility that maybe celebrating conservative,

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,240
so-called liberals do also part together. Anyway, thanks for all the great things. We're doing

115
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,880
as a blog at Podcasts and Space. I look forward to meeting you and blog at Podcasts on my friend.

116
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,960
All right, Bill. Thank you very much, man. And I agree. And as you'll hear later on in this podcast,

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,920
Republicans and Democrats definitely can party together and we've been partying together without

118
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,400
really even knowing it or maybe only half of us were knowing it but the party still continues.

119
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:20,160
That is what makes America great for sure. Now, you were talking about a blogger con

120
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,400
trample edition, something that's a little bit longer. I wouldn't mind that myself. I'm stalking

121
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,960
up now on podcast and forcing myself not to listen because I sit on a plane for about 14 hours

122
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,960
from Amsterdam to San Francisco. So, you know, well, shit, my iPod won't even last that long but,

123
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,560
yeah, we'll give it, maybe I'll keep the volume down low and I won't use the buttons too much.

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,960
Maybe I can eat out 10 hours of listening pleasure. There's something you might want to take

125
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:56,080
along though and I, they put a link to this on scripting news is the piece that Australian

126
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,640
Broadcast Corporation did about podcasting. It's a very detailed piece, so I liked it a lot.

127
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,400
I basically hijacked the real stream and created an MP3 of it and so that again, that's linked

128
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,160
today. I think we're maybe from yesterday on scripting.com. Just a couple pieces I wanted to play

129
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,000
from this because it was so detailed and what I liked the most is they had a lot of radio industry

130
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,440
executives talking about what iPods and MP3 players and ultimately also podcasting will mean to their

131
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,960
business and, you know, how it's snuck up on them. Can you outside and going, what could we do here

132
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,920
to protect radio? I may be even grow out of it so we can either work a little less or for the

133
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,440
same amount of effort keep even more radio listening. Nick Pete.

134
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
You have all your favorite music living happily together in one place. Introducing the Apple iPod

135
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,400
from HP. Your PC will never be the same again. HP. In that. Downloading audio from the internet,

136
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,040
copying it to CDs, the rip and burn mentality has been around for a few years. What's really

137
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,080
new is podcasting. Adam Curry, internet millionaire and one of the first DJs of the music TV

138
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:26,960
station. Oh, man. Internet millionaire. Right. MTV has taken it up fast. Hi, I'm Adam Curry.

139
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,720
Welcome to the iPod platform. I didn't want you to hear that. That's the first piece of the

140
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,120
download feed. I should have prep this better. I'm sorry. Early this year,

141
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,520
Carrie wanted to find a way. I want to look for them. I'm looking for the guy who says that they're

142
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,360
really worried in the industry. Here it is. Our phone is expensive and as the audio downloading

143
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,600
and podcasting is easy and cheap, advertisers and commercial broadcasters are worried about loss

144
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,520
of revenue. And of course, heavyweight industry groups like the Recording Industry Association

145
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,440
have a thing or two to say as well. Adam Curry. The reason why I can absolutely survive is

146
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:13,280
nobody owns this. I was very specific in making iPod or org it's home. Nobody owns the way that

147
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,240
this stuff is traveling. I think we'll have much less of a fight with the RIA as people, of course,

148
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,440
we're going to start distributing music this way, whether in mixed form or radio form, but this

149
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,120
is going to be some issues there. I don't think anywhere near as big as what the NAB, the National

150
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,000
Association of Broadcasters could do if they totally misunderstand the result of putting these

151
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:44,400
technological bits together. Most people, particularly broadcasters, understand that there is now

152
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,560
a new antenna. There's a new channel. You can broadcast down and we don't know what the limits

153
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,280
of it are yet. So far, we haven't hit any major walls. And one of the reasons it hasn't hit major walls

154
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,880
is that it's relatively easy and cheap to have a little radio studio in your closet, record the

155
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,120
audio and distribute it over the internet. We really have two important things. I want to listen

156
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,040
to that guy a little bit. I wrote down the time codes. Maybe something should be done in the

157
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,000
team. I never seem to sleep. They're tinkering away with computer code.

158
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,240
There's this podcast being people who are here today. They never seem to sleep. They're

159
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,280
tinkering away with computer codes, playing around with the new technology and they

160
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:39,200
organize blogger conferences, like blogger con, which is on a day. And you don't have to be there

161
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,120
because all the proceedings will be podcast. I believe this will be the first conference where

162
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,200
podcasting is going to be up front and center. Yeah. Okay. Well, somewhere in this piece and it's about

163
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,600
15 minutes long. I'm not going to look for it anymore. I don't understand why how I lost that.

164
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,600
There's a piece about a radio executive saying, we were too busy paying attention to kicking

165
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,840
the others guy. The other guys asked on the FM frequencies and all these iPod and MP3 players and

166
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,400
people doing stuff with them kind of snuck up on us. I think what happened is I wrote down the

167
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,560
time codes when it was an AIFF and probably when I compressed it down to an MP3 something went wrong.

168
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,040
Let's just see because I wrote down a very specific time code where they were talking about

169
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,120
about John Stuart. Let's see if I can find this reactionary talk. Well, I thought you were going to be funny. Come on.

170
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,520
He thought, no, I'm not going to be your monkey. What? What? Within minutes, perhaps seconds of the

171
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,120
show being broadcast, it was copied, distributed and downloaded via the web. You could watch the

172
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,160
video on your computer. Cliffs of the audio were inserted into podcasts and re broadcast.

173
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,560
More people got it via the web than watched on television. No one asked CNN for permission to

174
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:03,040
re broadcast. The point is we got it out there and the traditional media in this case Australian

175
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
broadcast corporation noticed that we got it out there and we got it out there fast and that was

176
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,120
blogging. That was just blogs passing this around and along with that some podcasters wrote

177
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,320
on that and we're getting pretty powerful here. I wanted to make a bridge between

178
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:27,840
that bit about John Stuart and an appearance that John did made on C-SPAN, which I was also sent

179
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,480
a number of pointers to. First of all, in this and this is about an hour, it's a bit more than

180
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,800
an hour's worth of show. The quality is pretty low. I'm just going to play a little bit about it because

181
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:46,640
this was actually recorded or broadcast before the CNN crossfire interview. It's interesting

182
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,680
the language that John Stuart uses is I don't know how that works, how that can air on C-SPAN.

183
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,280
He said mother fucker and shit and fuck a couple of times and act, you know, I didn't really notice

184
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,480
it because I'm so used to podcast and it didn't phase me at all. But I was like, whoa, you know,

185
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,120
hold on a second. How does that work? How come the FCC allows that to happen on C-SPAN

186
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,200
and yet stops so much more, you know, Janet Jackson's nipple for instance. So anyway,

187
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,760
since everyone enjoyed that piece of John Stuart so much on crossfire, here's a little bit more

188
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,120
of the source code to his thoughts as he talks about this interview recently on C-SPAN.

189
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
You know, you should have done at that point, you said,

190
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,120
did he allow you to bring up no vacuuming? No, it's not a good good.

191
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,000
My editor said, don't trade jokes. I'm not sure. But your chapter is called the

192
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,720
Microsy's valiant Voguearians about the press. That is correct. What do you mean?

193
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,760
Voguearians? I mean that the lowering of the discourse is done with tenacity.

194
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:03,040
The press has bravely and nobly eroded the public trust. And I celebrate that.

195
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,720
You, you also said, I Charlie Rose recently. It's the wrong room for this, by the way.

196
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
No, it's great. I've done this at a union meeting.

197
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,440
C-SPAN 11. All right. You told Charlie Rose about politicians who you said,

198
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,160
seek above all else to retain power, quote, when you go to a zoo and see a monkey throwing poop,

199
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,600
you go, that's what monkeys do. What are you going to do? But then you went on to say,

200
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,560
what I wish the media would do more frequently is say, bad monkey. It's a brilliant metaphor.

201
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
What I meant to say was when you see a monkey masturbating at the zoo.

202
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,760
Listen, the room is dark and he's looking at you and it's very comfortable and you throw out

203
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,440
the monkey metaphor. You know, they're not all gems, can? I'm riffing, baby. I'm spritzing.

204
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm working the room and it's dark and he loads you into sleeping thing and you've been

205
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,360
listening to the minister of Singapore for half hour and you know, you get out there and you don't

206
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:20,000
know where you are. Shit happens. What would happen if Hitler were interviewed by Larry King? What?

207
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,040
More coffee? Let me go back to the bad monkeys.

208
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:45,200
The gist. The essence to distill that is that we require what I'm advocating is that the

209
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,000
media come work for us again, that that remove themselves from the symbiotic relationship that they

210
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,320
have developed with the power structures of corporations and of the politics. And

211
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:14,080
we as Americans can we shall fight? Never give in. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened there.

212
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,040
No, it is all together too comfortable. We're busy in the world. We have things to do.

213
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,840
And the corporate mentality and the political mentality is to create layers of

214
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,920
obfuscation that make it difficult to penetrate what's going on. And the print media, by the way,

215
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,520
is very different. Most of what I'm talking about is television. And the print media is much better

216
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,200
providing context, but you're providing it a week later and by then everybody's moved on.

217
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
I mean, that's the sad truth about it. It's the world moves much more quickly now. And

218
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,160
the real responsibility now lies where the people set the agenda. And the agenda is set on the

219
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,040
24-hour networks. And unless you're keeping up with them and unless they are held to a certain

220
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,800
level of accountability, that's where the death is lost. Let me just say with that John last night

221
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,720
in the debate, you wish the media had said, what about the monkeys?

222
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Well, again, it's not about a process. It's not about a moment. And so it's not about one debate

223
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:29,440
and it's not about one issue. It's about holding to account this idea that debate is to advocates

224
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,840
for two corrupt organizations that to have a democratic strategist and a Republican strategist

225
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,160
is not a debate that's Coke and Pepsi discussing beverage supremacy. And it's not, it's not real

226
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,800
and just suggests that it is what I'm suggesting is that the person mediating that has to have

227
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,320
some expertise and has to have a job and their job can't be, what do you think Donna Brazil?

228
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Okay, what do you think babe, you can and we'll be right back. That's not a job. That's doing nothing.

229
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,840
And it's allowing two people to dominate a debate that are strategists and understand

230
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,320
the television press is getting their asses kicked and they're doing it willingly. And that's the

231
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,800
thing that I think is so frustrating to watch at home because they have a role and they have a job

232
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,400
and they're not doing it and that drives you insane when you watch. Go back to my, I should

233
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,040
end it with a joke. We'll give you another opportunity, thank you. Larry King, you're right about

234
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,880
so that's John Stewart on C-Spat. I like it when he gets really serious and even said that I should

235
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,280
have ended with a joke. I don't think so. I thought I think it was really right on the money. Perfect.

236
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,640
And I've spoken about this before, but I have a request in for an interview with John Stewart.

237
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,480
His people know about it and it's obvious that podcasting still won't

238
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,680
take the forefront when it comes to elections. So it won't have a chance to talk to John

239
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,720
until after the elections. But then again, it may be just as important and just as exciting

240
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,280
depending on how the elections go. You're listening to the Daily Source Code today is the first

241
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,080
of November, 2004 time for the tap dancing podcast or news.

242
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,360
What's most with cameras to form a documentary crew? A guy trying to stab his girlfriend

243
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,960
for voting for Terry? Another guy ran down Florida's former secretary. The red socks won the first

244
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,720
world series. It's not much less than a hundred years. But the headlines didn't waste much

245
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,680
space on theories. Drugs replaced the website with new terrorists fears. Now Gibson called Arnold's

246
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,720
a neighbor to say he won't support public funding for stem cell research. He said Arnold

247
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,160
couldn't be short, but Arnold claims he called no right. Not to attack. Or even to brag.

248
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,480
Mills, we saw well though we'd be moments with mental neck. Stay tuned for late breaking.

249
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:31,600
Okay. That's the tap dancing podcast for news. I love that. Tap dance and podcast

250
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,880
news, which comes through on the openpodcast.org feed. This is number 65 on the open podcast.org

251
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,160
RSS feed. I figured out who this is and I sent her an email hoping that we could get her set up

252
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,280
with her own feed because I'd like to subscribe to that separately. And I'd also like to point

253
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,800
to because I think that's this is perfect. That's one minute 15 seconds of pure joy. Great

254
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,280
creativity. A longer comment now. I want to say longer. I'm talking more than five minutes. But

255
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,960
well worth listening to Ken Gans from Louisville, Kentucky. He starts off talking a little bit about

256
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:13,040
podcasting. But kind of halfway through the conversation it turns a little bit. But not bad. Interesting.

257
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,880
I want you to listen. I think you'll enjoy this. Hello there. Adam Curry. My name is Ken Gans.

258
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,400
And I live in Louisville, Kentucky. I've been the avid podcaster actually a receiver of podcast

259
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,840
for about the last three weeks. Guess I got started just about the time this whole technology was

260
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,240
just starting to break loose. And I have to admit I'm addicted to the daily source code

261
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:50,400
and also the trade secrets podcast. So I guess for that, do you get a hearty

262
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:01,040
boi? If you prefer the more machine-based boi around we have. I love that.

263
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,440
Well anyway, I never recorded anything on my Mac before. So I bought a microphone today and then

264
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,720
little did I know I also needed a preamp because I couldn't hear a thing when I hooked a mic up.

265
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,080
But I got this goofy radio shack mic and I'd be curious to hear what other people are using.

266
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,880
Especially I'm curious what you use because it sounds very good. Yeah, let me tell you.

267
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,560
First of all, I love radio shack. Radio shack rules. It is the store that bloggers

268
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,360
survive on. I have a couple radio shack mics. I like them very much. What I'm using is a wireless

269
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:50,240
set and it's made by... where these guys. Electrosonics, LEC, TROS, O and ICS, Electrosonics.

270
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,960
This is a really expensive set. This is a main of because it's a professional television

271
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,560
wireless microphone. But you might be able to use a little bit of filtering because it sounds

272
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,480
just a little bit muddled, but not bad. I support radio shack especially for their microphones.

273
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,800
What you want to get is you want to get the metal one that looks just like a sure. There's

274
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,400
something like 39 bucks and really those those will work fine. But this one sounds pretty good.

275
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:24,800
And I've seen to remember you mentioned that it was like a clip on mic. So I'd like to find out

276
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,880
what that is. You know, we've got a couple things in gallon and then there's a couple things that

277
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:39,040
are just total opposites. I'm a Jersey boy. Born in Jersey grew up there. I spent 20

278
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,320
some of my years there before I struck out of my own. I'm an aircraft mechanic and a pilot.

279
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,720
Though I'm not a current pilot. I haven't flown a long time. But I do have that love of aviation.

280
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,920
And of course, I'm also a computer geek. No training in that field. I just seem to have that

281
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,600
extra chromosome that allows people to understand unix and shell scripts and stuff like that.

282
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,680
On a little more serious note, I remember listening to the daily source code when you told

283
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:18,080
everyone about your mom's condition. And I've ever since that day I've prayed for each day

284
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,520
a junior family. When I was three years old, my dad died of lung cancer. That was back in 1962.

285
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,600
And then just five years later, my mom died also of lung disease. So I'm very familiar with

286
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,240
how those things work and they were both heavy smokers and probably living in the old garden

287
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,160
state wasn't helping too much either. But anyway, best of luck to your mom, best of luck to you and

288
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,400
your family and I hope everything goes okay. So that's the end of the love vest. Now let's get down

289
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,000
to some of the differences. Oh, here it goes. From time to time, I hear you and Dave Weiner talking

290
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,440
about someday maybe podcasting video as if that's the next step or whatever. But as a user,

291
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,720
that's the last thing I want to see. I think what makes podcasting great is that when you are

292
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,920
passively listening to it with headphones or earbuds or whatever, you can do stuff like

293
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:32,000
driving or riding a bike. I frequently listen while walking around a park and doing other kinds of

294
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,040
activities like that. Also, there's something kind of cool about having you and Dave right between

295
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,600
my ears, although from time to time it's a little scary too. It's like the shows kind of originating

296
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,680
right from within my own head. Now what would really be cool and what I would like. Have you ever

297
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:58,560
seen how a Griffin I trip works with iPod? You get your iPod to play these tones that Griffin has

298
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:09,360
and you plan through the iPod and the I trip interprets these sounds and tunes itself to

299
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,400
the certain FM radio frequencies so it can broadcast over the air to your radio so you can

300
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:26,240
connect your iPod wirelessly. The tone sound something like this. Well now that's how I want

301
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,280
my iPod and podcast or I don't want a video. I want the iPod interface directly to my cerebral

302
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:43,120
cortex and I want the podcast like the Griffin I trip tones. Those because video to appear directly

303
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:51,680
in my brain. That will be a cool application. I do like Dave's idea of having like a two-way

304
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,240
interface where the podcast center the iPod and the user can also create things. I want to

305
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,120
wait for the computer on the iPod to upload to the web and then go to other people's iPods as podcast.

306
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Now I guess the last criticism that I have. There's my dog pixel. Probably isn't going to exist.

307
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,720
Oh, you're a dog pixel? You are a computer game dude. I'm going to respond to all the things

308
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,360
that Ken said by the way because I have some responses but first we got to get through his final beef.

309
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:37,360
The past two's day once the elections are done but what the heck is it with you and Dave supporting

310
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,880
Kerry? I cannot for the life of me understand that. I guess I know you don't live in the country so

311
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,600
maybe all you have to go buy is the BBC or something so you've got totally distorted view of the situation

312
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,160
and I know that Dave lives out there and the people's Republic and Seattle but as I mentioned

313
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:05,520
I live in Kentucky. I live in the heartland. I live in a big cluster of red states. In the heartland

314
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,400
you learn how to take the measure of a man. When you look at John Kerry you don't see anything worthwhile.

315
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,920
That guy's not fit to pick the cheese out from between George Bush's toes. Okay, hold on one second.

316
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,960
I got a respond to that one. When I look at John Kerry and I see him testifying in the Senate

317
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,760
during Vietnam right after he got out of Vietnam looking at what he went through at Vietnam

318
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:38,640
he is a man. He definitely is fit to at least pick out the cheese between George Bush's toes

319
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,920
which is a horrible visual Ken. What's Dave talking about a civil war?

320
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,000
Good freaking guy. That is so over the top. I could not believe it when he said that

321
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,040
in fact if there were any kind of trouble at all the only reason there would be is because

322
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Democrats are like a bunch of spoiled little kids. Even before the election or over here shoot

323
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:10,880
up campaign headquarters, robbing campaign headquarters, assaulting Republican campaign workers

324
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,560
are they telling you any of that stuff on a BBC over there? Right next door here in Tennessee

325
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,280
they shot up Republican campaign headquarters. It's almost like you got the adults, the

326
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,920
Republicans running against the kids, the Democrats and they seem to exist for no other reason

327
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:36,640
than to spread fear and certainty and doubt. I think even if Bush wasn't president, they'd find

328
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:44,240
some reason just to raise hell. This is not the Democratic Party of 20 years ago. This is a bunch of

329
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,280
I guess what they remind me of is just spoiled little rich kids. You know, you got Jennifer Lopez

330
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,400
over here saying stuff like if you vote for George Bush, rape is going to be legal. I mean these

331
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,200
people are just so over the top is ridiculous. And I think even you mentioned that a

332
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,760
not letting what happened in Florida happen again, nothing happened in Florida. The only thing

333
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,080
to happen in Florida is you had a bunch of Democrats misdesign the ballot so that the idiots

334
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,600
down there can figure out how to vote straight. And then when people looked at all the votes,

335
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,720
you know, several independent new services, night ridder, a bunch of them looked at the

336
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,800
tally's months and months after the election. Well, it came up the same. Even if the election

337
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,480
wasn't decided in the Supreme Court, George Bush went to one. Case closed. They've been living

338
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,560
with this for four years like it was going to kill them if they didn't get George Bush out of the

339
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,080
White House. And what are they going to replace them with? I've got who when the gun gets stuff

340
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,640
looks for the nearest person to stick a knife in their back and twist it. He did it in 1971 and

341
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,000
too. And he's doing it right now to the third infantry division blaming him for some small amount

342
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,160
of explosives that are missing over in Iraq. I mean, the guy is just, I think Mrs. Cheney said

343
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,920
it best. He's not a good man. He doesn't deserve to be president. In fact, I don't even deserve

344
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,920
thinking he deserves to be a senator, but the good people of Massachusetts will have to fix that.

345
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:29,120
Anyway, I don't want to leave on a sour note, but can imagine how, how if you want to listen to

346
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:38,160
you and Dave talking and I'm sitting there in my car. Y'all in my head off. You guys seem like

347
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,440
pretty intelligent people. I don't really understand how you could be so swayed in the wrong direction

348
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,400
on this election. But like I said, I really enjoy your podcast. I think what you guys are working on

349
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,760
here is a really fantastic thing. I wish you all the best. And like I said, I'll keep your

350
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,480
you and your family and my prayers and I hope everything goes well with your mom. Thanks a lot

351
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,680
for everything. Take it easy. Yeah, that's what I like so much about the community that we have.

352
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,320
We can differ of opinion and boy do Dave and I differ from of opinion, from Ken Gansson, Louisville.

353
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,280
I wouldn't know where to start, because I just wouldn't make any sense to go into each point

354
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,680
individually, but I felt it was good to let the source code listeners hear. It's an equal time

355
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,680
from the other side. And also how we can still party together, regardless of our viewpoints.

356
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,840
And we clearly both love America a lot. So a couple of the things I wanted to touch on,

357
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,000
if there was so much in that audio comment. And I don't know if you have a podcast Ken,

358
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,080
but I would really look forward to subscribing to it. Let me know so I can get in the iPod or

359
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,840
or directory. Because it's refreshing to hear something else once the while. Even if I don't

360
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,480
agree with it at all. And I picked up a couple clips that I wanted to play for you as a relate

361
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,680
to your podcast. The first one, well, of course, is about the elections and the voting booth.

362
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:41,840
And he says in our hands, heading to my voting booth. I am the old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old

363
00:38:41,840 --> 00:39:11,840
old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old

364
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I vote, it makes things right

365
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Out of my house, or rush to the bus stop

366
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,840
I found the way to make the worst out

367
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,840
It into my ethical culture

368
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,840
The truth, Kalello Hona Coppena

369
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
Isn't the beat for about to go down

370
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
They come every day well

371
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
I pick a wooden drop

372
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
And these big children real justice

373
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Learn the life from the father

374
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
And my mother, big kids and chemo

375
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
I like to tell you, hold me and I'm holding you

376
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
I'm real close

377
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
I'm here in whispers

378
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
We need a peace rhythm

379
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Oh yeah

380
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
To be right

381
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Everyone's got love with, oh yeah

382
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I'll be your voice

383
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,840
I'll be your love

384
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Oh yeah

385
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Hurry into my voting group

386
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
I am the end

387
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
You're not here

388
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,840
But like that's why I'm thinking

389
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,840
I'm choosing one minute to vote for her

390
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Which makes things that I want

391
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
My vote then makes things right

392
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,840
It's fire, it's burning to my voting goes to the end

393
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I am the end

394
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Oh no, you're back

395
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,840
I can't hear about like that's why I'm saying

396
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,840
It's losing one leader to vote for you

397
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Which be sensitive for you

398
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,840
My vote makes things right

399
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Well that's right

400
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Unfortunately, done enough metadata

401
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Pass along with that MP3 file

402
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Through blog digger their MP3, the blog digger media feed

403
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
To let you know who that is

404
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
All know is it's called voting booth

405
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
And there's also a karaoke version out there

406
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
But I don't know who it's by too bad

407
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Excuse me

408
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Going back to a little bit more of

409
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Ken's audio comment there

410
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,840
He mentioned that he had a new microphone

411
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
And he's not the only one

412
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
There was another podcast that I bumped into

413
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
That also had a new microphone

414
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,840
We didn't have any complaints about the audio before

415
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
Aside from my own

416
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Welcome to blogosphere news

417
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
My name is Mack and I'll do a host

418
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,840
We take a look at what's happening in around the blogosphere

419
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,840
For Friday, October 29th, 2004

420
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Quite a few items to get to today

421
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
But first off, the big news here at blogosphere

422
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Radio is that we got a new microphone

423
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,840
We didn't have any complaints about the audio before

424
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Aside from my own dissatisfaction with the quality of our voice

425
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
But in any case, audio quality should be much better

426
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
At the very least, I'm excited to have a new toy

427
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,840
I love hearing that

428
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
That's blogosphere news

429
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,840
And they got a new microphone over there

430
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,840

And there's always some good stuff in there

434
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
There was always some nice little nougat

435
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,840
A tip for the microphone there

436
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Maybe you want to try and move it away from the computer's fan

437
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
And maybe move your face in a little bit

438
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Close to the microphone

439
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Close to the micang is what we call that in professional terms

440
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,840
And that'll give you a better result

441
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
And what I've done in the past

442
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Sometimes when either there was a wall that didn't give me

443
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,840
The right acoustics or if there was fan noise

444
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,840
You can also kind of position two couch pillows

445
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Next to each other in a V form

446
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,840
That close behind the microphone

447
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
That has been known to work pretty well

448
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,840
So yeah, I'll be listening to the blogosphere news

449
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,840
And see if anything changes in the acoustics

450
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Now here's the one thing that really blew me away

451
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,840
about Ken's audio comment

452
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,840
If you have this griffin eye trip

453
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
If you have an eye pod, you might have seen this or heard about it

454
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,840
The eye trip is a little plastic accessory

455
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,840
That plugs into the top, I'm doing it here

456
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,840
I'm doing it here, just to plug to the top of your eye pod

457
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,840
And it enables you to broadcast the signal

458
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,840
From your eye pod onto your car radio

459
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Or any FM radio for that matter

460
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,840
I found that the signal was pretty good

461
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,840
And many times I'm sure if you have this

462
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Then you've probably set it to a popular station

463
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,840
And turn it on and see if people around you

464
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,840
And traffic if they look down at the radios

465
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
If they're trying to figure out what's going on

466
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,840
So the way that you use this thing

467
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Is you basically just once you start playing

468
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,840
It uses the headphone jack and it uses the little connector jack

469
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
It recognizes that audio is coming through

470
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
It fires up, it starts broadcasting

471
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,840
And it broadcasts at whatever signal you set it to

472
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Now the way you set it is, and that's what you heard in the audio comment

473
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,840
Is you have to play a series, actually it's just a little MP3 file

474
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Of a couple of short blips

475
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,840
And that then changes the frequency

476
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,840
To whatever those blips are associated with

477
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
So I'd like to try something out here

478
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,840
If you're on an eye trip, if you're listening

479
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Right now, hopefully you're somewhere in traffic

480
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Because what we're going to do is I'm going to switch all the iPods

481
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,840
That are using eye trip at this very moment

482
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,840
To 100.3 FM, which is a very popular frequency

483
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
For top 40 stations

484
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,840
And it should automatically change by me sending out the tones

485
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
So I'm going to send out the tones

486
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,840
That will program everyone's eye trip

487
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,840
To start broadcasting on 100.3 FM

488
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,840
And of course I'm going to try this myself to see if it works

489
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,840
I'm just presuming it does

490
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,840
So let's switch all those iPods to 100.3 FM

491
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
Okay everybody

492
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
Look around, look at the traffic

493
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
How you doing?

494
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,840
Welcome to the daily source code on 100.3 FM

495
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Long ago in days of your

496
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,840
It'll begin with a god named Thor

497
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,840
There were bikers and boats and some plans for a furniture store

498
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Not a bodega, it's not a mall

499
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,840
And this is a thankful apartment smaller

500
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
The mine is if there were a part

501
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,840
My smaller than mine

502
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Ikea

503
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Ikea

504
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Ikea

505
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Ikea

506
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Everyone has a home

507
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
If you don't have a home

508
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,840
You can buy one there

509
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,840
I ran a car, take the bus

510
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Lay our cash down

511
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,840
And put your trust in the land

512
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,840
Where the furniture pulls you a much smaller size

513
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,840
Feeling the book is his hello

514
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,840
So does the table, his name is Ingo

515
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
And the chair is a ladder back

516
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,840
Where his butt is friends calling Carl

517
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Ikea

518
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Just a morning to find a handful of noise men

519
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Ikea

520
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
Ikea

521
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Ikea

522
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Ikea

523
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Ikea

524
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Everyone has a home

525
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
If you don't have a home

526
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,840
You can buy one there

527
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,840
Ikea

528
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Flyward

529
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Brush

530
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
Feel

531
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Ikea

532
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
Meatballs

533
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
Taste

534
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Ikea

535
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Ikea

536
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
I'll end

537
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
RENCHES

538
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
All the back free

539
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
All the back free

540
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
All the back free

541
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
Sorry I said Ikea

542
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Sucks

543
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,840
I just bought a table for 60 bucks

544
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And a chair

545
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
And a lamp

546
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,840
And a shelf

547
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
That's the candles for you

548
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,840
I was a doubt of just like you

549
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,840
Till I saw the American dream come true

550
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
In the journey

551
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,840
They got a goddamn Swedish parade

552
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
Ikea

553
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Just a morning to find a handful of noise men

554
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Ikea

555
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Ikea

556
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Ikea

557
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
Ikea

558
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,840
Ikea

559
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Everyone has a home

560
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,840
If you don't have a home

561
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,840
You can buy one there

562
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Here's from Chester, Connecticut

563
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
His name is Jonathan Coolton

564
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
The album is smoking monkey

565
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,840
That's his O2 Ikea

566
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,840
And now that we're moving

567
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,840
Even we are loving the joy

568
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
That Ikea can bring

569
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,840
When you need that book

570
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,840
You just don't can't get the right size

571
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
And you don't want to chop up

572
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Something antique

573
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,840
Ikea's got it all for you

574
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
I want to talk one second about this

575
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Great new podcast production system

576
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
I'm working on

577
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,840
It's kind of a podcast production console

578
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
I'm using radio user land

579
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,840
If you've never seen this program

580
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
You can download a 30 day trial

581
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
It's a weblogging client

582
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
But it does so much more

583
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,840
And a lot of it is based around

584
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
It's internal scripting language

585
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,840
It's object oriented database

586
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,840
Or object database

587
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,840
And everything is done in outliners

588
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,840
And ever since

589
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
I was introduced to Frontier

590
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,840
Which they win or conceived

591
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
And created and built so many years

592
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,840
I've loved outliners

593
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,840
Outliners make so much sense

594
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,840
To the way my brain works

595
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,840
And I love

596
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,840
I've been using outliners to

597
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,840
To line up radio shows

598
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,840
And basically if you look at

599
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
That the line up of today's show

600
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,840
And I will post a screenshot

601
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840
You'll see that everything is neatly in a row

602
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,840
From top to bottom

603
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,840
And as I go down my list

604
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,840
I can expand each node

605
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,840
And that might have an email message in there

606
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,840
But now it also has special nodes

607
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,840
And with a little music note next to it

608
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,840
So I know that that's an audio clip

609
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,840
And if you double click on it

610
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,840
It opens up the file

611
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
In quick time

612
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,840
Ready to play

613
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,840
So it's a great way for me to organize

614
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,840
All the things I need

615
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,840
I used to have 20 quick time windows open

616
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,840
And moving stuff around

617
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,840
And that's really expensive

618
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
For desktop real estate

619
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Excuse me

620
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,840
Oh boy

621
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,840
So now all I have to do

622
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
Is basically when I get an MP3

623
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
I want to add I just drop it into a folder

624
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,840
If there's an email that I want

625
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,840
I forward it to a special email address

626
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,840
It all gets sucked into one central place

627
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,840
All of the MP3's been scanned

628
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
For metadata

629
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,840
And put into a general playlist

630
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,840
And then everything that's new

631
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,840
We put into the new playlist

632
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
So I can select from those

633
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,840
And because it's an outline

634
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
You can just move stuff around

635
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,840
If you want this part of the show to come earlier

636
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
You can move it up or you could even cut and paste

637
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,840
And it's really fantastic

638
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,840
And what's nice about it

639
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
And I haven't done that part yet

640
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
Because I'm slow but I'm getting there

641
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Is I want to be able to just save that outline

642
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
And it should go with

643
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,840
The podcast for that day

644
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
It should be a part of the post

645
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,840
And you'll get all the metadata

646
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,840
That's relevant to what I played

647
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
You'll get all the links to webpages

648
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,840
That I reference everything I'll be in one spot

649
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,840
And even better than that

650
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,840
Because it's OPML

651
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,840
And we've been talking about OPML on the source code

652
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
Because it's OPML

653
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
You'll be able to hook in to different pieces of it

654
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,840
So we could basically have this huge

655
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,840
Interconnected decentralized

656
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
Podcast production suite

657
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,840
This network

658
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
If I hear something cool on your podcast

659
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,840
Is going to your podcast console

660
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
And look for that file

661
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,840
And I could actually bring it in

662
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
And then use that in my podcast

663
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,840
I mean the thoughts are just mind-boggling

664
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,840
But how this outline or expands

665
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,840
And I'm learning about something really important

666
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,840
And outline is called node types

667
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,840
So what happens when you click on a node

668
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
It can contain a link to a website

669
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
It opens up your web browser

670
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,840
It can contain a link to another OPML file

671
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,840
It can contain RSS file

672
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
It can contain an MP3

673
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,840
That opens up in the quick time player

674
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,840
It's mind-boggling

675
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
It really is

676
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,840
So we are going to run about an hour

677
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,840
Probably a little bit over

678
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,840
But it's well worth it because we got some more audio

679
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,840
Comments on the way and some bush

680
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,840
And carry cut-ups

681
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,840
And if you're feeling down

682
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,840
Have you been in a rut lately

683
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
Then listen to the latest podcast

684
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,840
From career opportunities

685
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
Anyone no matter what their age

686
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Confine themselves in the depths of a rut

687
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,840
It can start out slowly

688
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
Going to the same restaurants

689
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
Using the same software

690
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,840
Listening to the same music

691
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,840
The next thing you know

692
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,840
There you are in a rut

693
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,840
As I'm finding getting older

694
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Can make it even easier to get into a rut

695
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,840
There are days when I simply don't want to face

696
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
The trials and tribulations of daily life

697
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,840
I just want to do something familiar

698
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
Of course

699
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,840
A few days later

700
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,840
I wake up feeling bored

701
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,840
And not really knowing why

702
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Even though I know the importance of finding new challenges, new passions and new input

703
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,840
I have to actively reach out and engage the world in order to find them

704
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,840
Imagine my rut-ridden joy

705
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,840
When I discovered something new to engage my intention this last week

706
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
Due to an odd set of circumstances

707
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
I found myself with a week without much consulting work

708
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
As I headed into the week

709
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
I was dreading it

710
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
How was I going to make productive use of this time?

711
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,840
In scanning my daily list of RSS feeds

712
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,840
Yet another way I try to find new, interesting tidbits

713
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,840
I came across ipotter.org

714
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,840
Adam Curry, a former VJ and current DJ

715
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Put together an Apple script to automatically collect MP3 files posted to the net

716
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
Download them

717
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
And push them into iTunes

718
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,840
And then to the iPod

719
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
This immediately caught my attention

720
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
I don't have an iPod, but the new shows I discovered

721
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Engaged me immediately

722
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,840
They also gave me a way to randomly sample new music as it came across the wire

723
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Much that I would have never sought out on my own

724
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Wow

725
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,840
Here was a whole new world opening up

726
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
With very little effort

727
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,840
I immediately grabbed the software and began to closely follow the iPod or world

728
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,840
Including a group that quickly collapsed to expand development on the software side

729
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,840
Suddenly I was energized

730
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,840
I didn't want to go to bed at night and couldn't wait to get up in the morning

731
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Here was this little piece of the internet that was making me excited about technology again

732
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,840
I was looking to break the rut and podcasting appeared to help

733
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,840
These good feelings spread to other aspects of my life

734
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,840
I found a few more topic ideas for this column

735
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,840
Posted some good stuff on my weblog

736
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,840
And had a great time at the free computer class I give it the library every month

737
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:49,840
Don't discount how one small thing can wake you up and shake you out of your rut

738
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
Even in some small way

739
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,840
If you can reach out and find one small toe hold

740
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,840
It can help to raise you up

741
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,840
If you're stuck in a rut you have to force yourself to look at one new webpage

742
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,840
One new piece of art read one new magazine or listen to one new song anything to get your mind working again

743
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,840
When you're languishing

744
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,840
You have to keep listening for the knock of opportunity at the door

745
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,840
While this discovery of podcasting helped me to get my thinking moving in other ways

746
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,840
It also got me started on a project I thought about for years

747
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,840
Producing audio versions of my columns

748
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,840
So the people could listen to them on the bus on their bike or while doing their daily walk

749
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,840
In the past the technology just wasn't there to support my idea

750
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Now with podcasting

751
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,840
I could see a reason to drag out the mic and mixing console and get to work

752
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,840
So starting with my column of September 24

753
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,840
I'm producing a weekly show of each new column

754
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Released each Friday when the magazine is published

755
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Additionally, I'm releasing a column from the archives each week

756
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,840
You can use the iPodter software available from ipodter.org

757
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,840
To download the shows automatically as they're released

758
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,840
I think that's nice that we got a whole new podcast started

759
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
So that's career opportunities

760
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,840
And you can find career opportunities in the iPodter.org directory

761
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,840
Which is located of course at ipodter.org

762
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,840
If you just want to sample some new podcast stuff that's fresh

763
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Just then release go to audio.weblogs.com

764
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,840
And you can find links to the sites

765
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,840
You can if you mouse over the the name of the podcast

766
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,840
It'll give you the description of what was happening

767
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
What's happening in the podcast

768
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,840
There's a link to the direct link to the MP3 files

769
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,840
You can download sample it right there as it comes in

770
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:45,840
And of course the RSS 2.0 feed that's the XML icon

771
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:52,840
You copy that link and use that to subscribe to that feed in any iPodter software

772
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,840
And there's so much cool stuff happening in iPodter world

773
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,840
Now everyone's looking at how a new and novel way is to integrate the

774
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,840
The directory and thank you'll see now at ipodter.org

775
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,840
In the podcast directory under what's new

776
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,840
You'll see some new data which is the iPodter X guys data

777
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,840
They basically if you use iPodter X

778
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,840
They're keeping track of what podcast you're subscribed to

779
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,840
So they have the iPodter X favorites and top picks

780
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Which is based upon user data which is extremely cool

781
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
So make sure you check that out

782
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,840
And of course the what's new is automatically generated

783
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,840
If something is added to a node somewhere down the line

784
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,840
That's even maintained and someone else's opml file

785
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
It still shows up

786
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,840
It's neatly categorized by a year month and by the day

787
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,840
Thank you very much Dave for getting that in

788
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,840
We also a Dave released a feed checker

789
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,840
So you can see if your podcast feed works

790
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,840
And it will work with the with audio.weblogs.com

791
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,840
Which you can ping and there's all kinds of information about that on ipodter.org

792
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,840
Another comment and another podcast that started

793
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,840
Well, thanks to the podcasting

794
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,840
But in part thanks to the to the daily source code to

795
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Another podcast that I introduced you to

796
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,840
And it looks like we've got our American Indian brothers

797
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,840
On the podcast

798
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,840
Hi Adam my name is David Newberger

799
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,840
And I work for the Quarterling Tribe in beautiful plumber

800
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,840
I've been following podcasting since later

801
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,840
I guess when it first showed up on my radar

802
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,840
When I heard about it I thought wow

803
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,840
This is exactly what I've been looking for

804
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,840
A quick and easy way for our tribal members as well as employees

805
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,840
To get out information to the public

806
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,840
I started to think of ways to convince the tribal government of this

807
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,840
Which is where the daily source code comes in a play

808
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,840
On October 21st

809
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:40,840
You had an example podcast from Texas A and I'm the university called

810
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
The Agricultural News Weekly

811
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,840
This was a final piece of evidence I needed to convince the rest of tribe of

812
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Podcasting's practical uses

813
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,840
So with that firmly cemented in their minds

814
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,840
We are now working on a rather large list of programs to air through podcasting

815
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,840
We plan on using it as a way to get information that our tribal members

816
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
As well as non-Indians

817
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,840
Would like to know about the tribe and Indian country in general

818
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,840
So thank you very much for helping me convince the tribe to use this new technology

819
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,840
Here's just one small example of what we will be using it for

820
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,840
Hello and welcome to the Court of Land Tribes

821
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,840
Smoke Management Report for Thursday, October 28th, 2004

827
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,840
This message has been produced by the Court of Land Tribes

828
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,840
Thank you very much David Newberger for that comment

829
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,840
That's extremely cool, please let me know

830
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,840
When the tribal podcasts are up so we can point to them and add them to our directory

831
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,840
Hey, that's cool. We could have a whole new maybe you want to maintain a directory

832
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
Node with the tribal podcasts

833
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,840
Excellent stuff

834
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Okay, winding it up for today with a couple of emails and responses

835
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,840
The first one from Brendan Creasy

836
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,840
I'm just expanding the node here for my email

837
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,840
Oh, I remember this was about

838
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,840
You might have heard the source code early last week and I started off

839
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,840
and was a young child saying, you know, I listened to daily source code

840
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Adam Curry all day and I got an email from Brendan Creasy

841
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:24,840
who sent me that clip and he said, you know, I loved hearing the clip

842
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,840
of my friend's daughter talking on the source code overjoyed

843
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,840
But bum that I failed to give him credit, I apologize

844
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,840
But it was kind of hard to give credit at the beginning in a montage

845
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,840
But, you know, it's something to think about because

846
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,840
You send me stuff right and I use it and I presume that it's okay to use it

847
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,840
If you send that to me

848
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,840
But does this mean that we should start a credit to the end of each show?

849
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
I'm not against it by the way, just a little more work

850
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,840
But then that's something that I'll program into the podcast production console

851
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,840
So anyway, thank you very much to your friend's daughter

852
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,840
I we loved it enormously here on the show

853
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,840
And Wilson Roberto Afonso says, hey, Adam, great to hear you playing Brazilian music

854
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,840
even better when it's RIA free music, by the way

855
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,840
Did you know that the singer and composer of the song that I played

856
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,840
Remember that Latino song I played?

857
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Do you have Betto Jiu?

858
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,840
Currently, he's the Brazilian Minister of Culture

859
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,840
No, I did not know that

860
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,840
Excellent, so the Brazilian Minister of Culture is into RIA free music

861
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,840
Gotta keep our eye on that guy

862
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,840
Now we're going to leave you with some cool two cool mix ups

863
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,840
Political mix ups, of course

864
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,840
It's always easy to get some George Bush stuff

865
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,840
Chris Molotesta sent me a George Bush mix of clips

866
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,840
But right after that, I'll play some interesting clip montage

867
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
By John Kerry

868
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,840
I'm so doing, we don't only free the American people

869
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,840
We made our own people more secure

870
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,840
I didn't realize I had to black do

871
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,840
The minute I got elected

872
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,840
The storm clouds on the horizon

873
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,840
We're getting nearly directly overhead

874
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:06,840
But they underestimated what our campaign is about

875
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Well, thank you, Ashana, to witness that

876
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,840
The courageous stage of our careers

877
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,840
That's the chapter of the last chapter of the 2020 documentary

878
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,840
That's our 21st century that most of us would rather forget

879
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,840
The last chapter of the 20th century is the 1st chapter of the 21st century

880
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,840
I'm afraid that the union in our state must be the nation

881
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
We're every one called it

882
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,840
I asked the Americans to give 4,000 years

883
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,840
of 4,000 hours over the next of the last few lives

884
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
I'll serve as your mother

885
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,840
But I am a student 4,000 hours

886
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,840
This will dictate our ship in the heck a lot easier

887
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,840
Just for long time to dictate

888
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,840
I think war is the dangerous place

889
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,840
It'll take time to restore chaos

890
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,840
The tariffs and barriers everywhere are torn down

891
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,840
Our economy will be strong

892
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,840
That's our gas is the hemispheric

893
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,840
I like to call it hemispheric in nature

894
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Because it is a product that we can find in our own neighborhood

895
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Responses have got to end

896
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,840
In order for us to get this framework

897
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,840
The groundwork, the groundwork to discuss a framework for peace

898
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,840
All right

899
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
Know what I believe

900
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,840
We'll continue to articulate what I believe

901
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,840
And what I believe and I believe what I believe is right

902
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,840
Welcome to the People's Home

903
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,840
I'm sure you can imagine that there's an unimaginable honor to live here

904
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,840
I see it all the time when people come up to me and say

905
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,840
I don't want you to let me down again

906
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,840
San is whether they west that's this girl

907
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,840
Just like me there's an old saying in Tennessee

908
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,840
I know it's the best it's probably gonna say this

909
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
There's a fool me once

910
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,840
Same on

911
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,840
Same on you

912
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,840
The fool me can't get fool again

913
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,840
I am here to make an announcement

914
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,840
That this girl is me

915
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,840
It can count as airplanes

916
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
We'll fly out along the way you know

917
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,840
I ain't even know what you believe

918
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
Make a lot easier than I have to question

919
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,840
Hi

920
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,840
Hello

921
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,840
Podcasting

922
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,840
All's live

923
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,840
Adam

924
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,840
My first is to America

925
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,840
I have a plan

926
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Every plan

927
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,840
My health care plan

928
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,840
My plan for education

929
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,840
My plan for kids to be able to get better college loans

930
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,840
That my health care plan

931
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,840
But I got a better plan

932
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,840
I have a plan

933
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
I have a better plan for homeland security

934
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,840
I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror

935
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
Grab a plan

936
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,840
I have a plan

937
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,840
I've laid out a plan

938
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,840
I think my plan is better

939
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
And my plan

940
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
I have a plan in my plan

941
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
I have a plan

942
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,840
I also have a plan

943
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
I have a plan

944
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
I have laid out a different plan

945
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
and I have a better plan

946
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
I proposed a plan

947
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
My plan

948
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
I have a plan

949
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
I have a plan

950
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
I have a plan

951
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,840
I have a plan

952
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
I've a plan

953
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,840
and I have a plan

954
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
and I want to talk about my plan somewhere

955
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
I hope we can

956
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
I have a plan

957
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,840
That's why I have a plan

958
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,840
I have a plan

959
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,840
But I'll also have a better plan

960
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,840
I have a plan

961
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,840
I have a plan

962
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,840
You choose your plan

963
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
If you don't want to

964
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
take the offer

965
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,840
Of the plan that I'd want to put forward

966
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:18,960
I have a better plan. I have a plan. But I got a better plan. I have a plan to put America back to work

967
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,280
I have a plan. I have a plan. My plan does a better job and that's why I'll be a better commander in chief

968
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,600
Okay, so I promise you that if you vote for John Kerry, we're gonna make him stick to every single plan

969
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,600
He has promised

970
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,080
Well, I'm sorry

971
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,080
I got busted

972
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:47,240
So I used my one phone call to dedicate a song to you all the radio

973
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Yeah, I got busted

974
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:05,320
In custody, I imagine our melody being played on the grand piano

975
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,280
I saw your face if run of me

976
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,080
It was perfect, where we are

977
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:21,080
I saw light in the end of the tunnel

978
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,080
And it was you

979
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,080
Because you're like my rich son

980
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,080
Travelling to you

981
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
Because I'm not you, I'm like

982
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,080
You're like my rich son

983
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,080
Travelling to you

984
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,080
Yeah, I got busted

985
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:57,080
I paid it a dirty word on your old man's Mercedes Benz because he told me to do us

986
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:04,080
Yeah, I got busted

987
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:10,080
But soon it released me because the cops were sad

988
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:16,080
And they didn't know how to prove it

989
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:21,080
Oh, I saw your face in front of me

990
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,080
It was perfect, where we are

991
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:30,080
I saw light in the end of the tunnel

992
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,080
And it was you

993
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,080
Because you're like my rich son

994
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,080
Travelling to you

995
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Because I'm not you, I'm like

996
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,080
You're like my rich son

997
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,080
Travelling to you

998
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,080
Because I'm not you

999
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,080
It's also obvious

1000
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
So obvious

1001
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:00,080
So obvious

1002
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,080
So obvious

1003
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,080
So obvious

1004
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,080
That's the point

1005
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:11,080
Because you're like my rich son

1006
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,080
Travelling to you

1007
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,080
Because I'm not you, I'm like

1008
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:20,080
You're like my rich son

1009
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:38,080
You're not in my mind from the album when I said I wanted to be your dorm.

1010
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,080
You are the light, you're just like my not the baby source code.

1011
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,080
For October, no shit.

1012
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,080
November 1st, 2004.

1013
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:51,080
And that's it for your source code, time to run it down for today.

1014
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,080
As always, you can leave all your comments and suggestions on my weblog live.curry.com

1015

or through email at www.curry.com

1016
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,080
I'm getting through a lot of emails and getting some stuff done, please.

1017
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,080
And of course, all the archives of the new shows at dailysourcecode.com

1018
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,080
And that's it for Monday's show.

1019
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,080
I'll be back tomorrow as we continue to pack up all of our stuff.

1020
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,080
Get ready to remove and on Wednesday, I get ready to get out of here.

1021
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:27,080
I take it to San Francisco for BlenderCon, November 6.

1022
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,080
Take it easy, everybody.

1023
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,080
I'll see you.

1024
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:49,080
I'll be back tomorrow as we continue to pack up all of our stuff.
