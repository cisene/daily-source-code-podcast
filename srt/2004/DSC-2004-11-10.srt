1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi everybody!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One casting!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All's life!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And a parade!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
All's life!

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, how do you everybody welcome to the Daily Source Code for Wednesday?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
November 10th, 2004, coming to you from Flanders Belgium from Curry Castle.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It is your Daily Source Code.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And I've got something wrong with.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I have a podcast here.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Power!

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And maybe saying that so what the hell is podcast here?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I think it's actually going to be my ears by ways.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We can hear both so much in the past.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In the past weeks, one of the ones that I put watch out.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've got everything here.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's see if I can even hear my ears.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's painful.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to show me your buds and it sounds crappy.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But it really actually hurts the inner part of my ears.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's scraping around for the past days.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All right, for the next four minutes,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it's going to be bringing you all the latest in podcast about all three music.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And my day started off recently, Ruff.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
All things considered, of course.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm back now in the castle, which is pretty empty.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Patricia's packed up.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
She's kind of conglomerated areas of stuff.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And she's really taken care of this entire movie, which is so cool.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because I've been on the road,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
blogger con, traveling back and forth.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now you know, if you read my weblogged,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I had a six hour delay when I got to,

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or if you heard just a source code, of course,

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that had a six hour delay.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What you didn't hear is that my bag or one bag arrived

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
when I finally landed in Amsterdam.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The other bag was apparently trapped in London somewhere,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
which makes no sense.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I mean, one bag made it.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The other bag didn't shit like that happens.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They found it now.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The bag actually made it to Amsterdam today.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And, you know, I told them that Antwerp Airport was nearest.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I told them the KLM probably doesn't fly there.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I said, you should probably just have someone drive from

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Skippel Airport or Rotterdam Airport to our house.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now they flew the back to Brussels.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And that's about as far away from my house as

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
as Skippel Airport is in Holland.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So whatever.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But, you know, all my shaving stuff and

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Christina's good charlatte wall clock that I had all set up.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know, all of that stuff in that bag.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And, well, a second.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I just want to try a different pair of earphones.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't even know if I sound right.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And which leads me to believe that these headphones,

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
almost a second, shoot.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't go away.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, I don't do that very often.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I actually stopped the recording.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But, hold on a second.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I dropped the mic.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But that was really necessary because I couldn't hear anything.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, all right.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, these Sony earphones,

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I thought would be more comfortable in my ears.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In my tender ears now at this point,

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
really do not sound good at all.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm back to the iPod headset.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The reason I bought a new set of headphones at the airport

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because, well, first of all, I had some time to do some shopping.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Second of all, the wires are starting to come undone here.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You know, where the two wires that one leads to your left ear

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and one leads to your right ear and there's a little, you know,

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
kind of like a triangle thing there that's supposed to keep all the wires

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to keep them from stripping apart further.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But now the shielding is starting to come apart.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So, I figured I'd be ahead of the game, but I guess, you know,

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you've got headphones and headphones.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The Sony little ear buds there are no good.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, back to the iPods.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Man, my ears just hurt.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Anyway.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wow.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Back from, back from BloggerCon.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, we're still talking about it here and there on the podcast.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we'll have some of that coming up on the daily source code later on as well.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Some good comments, some interesting comments.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Got some music on the way by a BloggerCon participant.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And while I did not catch it while I was waiting at the airport,

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but you know, a big fan of OpenPodcast.org is always cool.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just to just a great feed to subscribe to, if someone wants to target you

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
with kind of like a promo about what's coming up on their podcast

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
or something's new.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So, I listened to that a lot besides checking out audio.weblogs.com,

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
which is probably the best place to sample new podcast that come in.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, audio.weblogs.com with every new podcast that's put up there that's pinged

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that server.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can read everything that was accompanied in the posted notes that goes with it.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can subscribe to the feed right there.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You can listen to the show.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can go to the website.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, it's excellent for sampling out sampling new podcasts.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, I do check those regularly and loan behold once the model message shows up.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In there, this is Ian McLeod.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Actually, an interesting attempt, at least I think it's interesting.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've noticed on Adam Curry's live.cray.com that you deleted an airport

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
for four hours and it's been there with live life.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I second up the podcast.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Here's a shot.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I started a challenge to see if possibly he's checking the OpenPodcast.org

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and if so, then Adam you're listening to this.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Trying to get your attention.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Not just your attention.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Can I get everybody's attention?

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Specifically, would like to see if I can get a dialogue going with you

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
at some point.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Check out quest.empowerweb.ca-rss.xml.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's the feed for you.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're just going to quest.empowerweb.ca.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I created a podcast.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Put it up.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Late last week, I'm going to be putting together a follow-up

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
about a whole bunch of really, really cool, very interesting thoughts

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
that I've had aggregated from a few different sources about where we're going

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to go with podcasting.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What tools do you need to create on the aggregators to the site

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and on the podcast production site?

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've seen the future.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes, my brother.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I wanted to put your hands on the podcast a few of the future coming

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
down the pipe.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So that's a good way to get something out in the open.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's what people hear about while you're promoting.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Open podcast.org, love it.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I also listened to Dave's morning coffee notes.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Another one he did on the road.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I was afraid for a second that his recording was going to be skipping again.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I kind of figured that out with him.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It skipped a couple of times in the beginning,

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but then it turned out to be a really clean, good recording.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And he cranked some tunes at the beginning on the car stereo.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's almost impossible to excerpt something from what's on

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
morning coffee notes.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I'm pretty sure Dave does that by design because he doesn't really want to

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
just have the excerpt he wants to go and listen to the whole thing.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I do encourage you to listen to this one.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Because he had some really good thoughts about what I like

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
particularly around 35 minutes into his podcast.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How we're going to work with the red states.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He touched on a lot of big things that came out of

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
bloggercon.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And how should we look at it for bloggercons to come?

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I think it was really just a brain dump that he really needed to do.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And it's cool.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So you should check that out from scripting.com.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The morning coffee notes podcast.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And as I was listening around to stuff that came in

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
through iPod.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I came across, well actually I subscribed to promiscuous bullet.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It was a Thomas and Stephen Bates.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And they had their thoughts about bloggercon.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I just wanted to play a little bit of a commentary.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And they had about the podcast session.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What session did you go to?

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What do you think about it?

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, I went to the podcast to one, of course.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was kind of interesting.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Adam Curry was not what I expected.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can't have a rock star on.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The thanks sunglasses were a little bit overboard.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Now that's interesting.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because I got to tell you that I used to wear contact lenses

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
until I was flying one time.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I put on my regular glasses, which you know,

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
glasses that I had from the 1975 or whatever.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then I discovered how much I was actually missing viewing

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the world through contact lenses.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They're like, this is just as inferior.

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I should go back to wearing glasses.

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And so I ordered out the pair of sunglasses,

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which remains specifically for flying.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And Patricia suggested I get pink glasses,

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
rose tinted glasses actually in my prescription.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because she said, you know, the world looks so beautiful.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I never really considered it from the other way around.

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I haven't really done any public speaking.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I haven't been on television in a long time.

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I consider that people would think that that was some kind of rock star

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
trip, you know, that they're not sunglasses.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They're just rose tinted glasses.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you know, the world looks nice better

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
through rose tinted glasses.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I just never really considered the other side.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I guess it could look kind of rock starish.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wasn't intended that way, certain?

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Other than that, he looked like a guy used to know

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
in Colorado that ran all of the battle bands

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
shows that I judged on named Biff.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And of course that makes everyone who's hearing

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
this thing about Biff Henderson from back to the future.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, it wasn't his real name.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm a Biff, ladies and gentlemen.

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But he made everyone call him Biff.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, I remember Biff.

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I thought that Mkree was a little bit like that too.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He was alright though.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh yeah, I liked Biff.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But I'm crazy.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like we could be.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I never actually got to talk to him.

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I see that's a shame.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And they're going to go on and they're going to talk a little bit more about the session.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They went through a whole thing about the microphones.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
David and I have discussed that on a trade secrets.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And he's discussed it in morning coffee notes that he's posted on his

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
on his on his on scripting news.

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And you know, there's a lot that we learned from that.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I think that a lot that can be done.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But let's just continue to listen to the promiscuous bullet conversation.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But he was kind of elite.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
See, that hurts.

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I certainly didn't want to be elite in any way shape or form.

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, it seemed like when he was doing the podcast thing.

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He stood up there and basically went down his list of people that he found and enjoyed

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and had decided to elevate.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh.

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I certainly, of course, the people that I knew.

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And I didn't know any of these people.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I didn't.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The only person I knew was Dave.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But certainly now the podcast is not face to face.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It never met them before.

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was happy to point him out.

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I wasn't trying to elevate anyone.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And so one pointed out, you know, rightly, it's a, hey, can't any, you know,

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
non-famous people get the mic.

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And this is a whole problem about using the mics of Blader Khan.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And I think really the only reason we were using them in hindsight was,

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
so that everything could be recorded properly for a podcast.

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And it probably hurt more than it did good because

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
the blog was supposed to be like screaming and talking through each other and showing

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
respect that appropriate times and jumping up and having comments.

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And, but I think we're past that.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think we, we understand that that could have been better.

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But certainly certainly sucks.

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I like, sounds like I'm trying to elevate people to some certain status.

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because this is a place for everyone to participate.

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was going to do his level and said, okay, is this guy here?

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Quick.

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Tell us something about your stuff.

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And then is this guy?

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, shit.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't, you know, I'm just waiting for people to raise their hands.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like, tell us about something about your stuff without actually letting the conversation flow

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and I didn't have dynamic way.

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hmm.

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I certainly tried to make it flow better in a dynamic way.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And some parts were slower than others.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And it was just a way to get some energy going, I guess.

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, I sort of felt that that session was a little bit tight like that, too.

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Now, I agree.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I certainly certainly a lot more I wanted to get out of it.

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But it was a blogger call, right?

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
People are going to jump in and say stuff and then we're going to point around the room.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So have the way it went.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There's Matthew Bischoff calling in.

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So we answer.

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Kind of busy.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Real quick, then.

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hey, Matthew.

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hey, Adam, what's up?

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm recording the source code right now.

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Awesome.

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I was just talking about the microphones of Blogger Khan.

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And I was listening to the promiscuous bullet podcast.

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And they're saying that I was elite.

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I made it a leadist.

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I'm hurting.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So we're going to do.

290
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What can I do for you, Matthew?

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Just want to your opinion on this.

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I just started up a cafe pressure up at a cafepress.com.

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So I thought I just wanted to take a look at it.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You realize I'm recording this, right?

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No problem.

297
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay.

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If I press dot com slash I potter, what is it?

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I potter merchandise?

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Cool.

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hold on.

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, right now everyone listening to the source code

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is surfing off to it immediately.

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So what is it?

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Explain what it is.

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, I saw that if you've seen the Doppler video.

308
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I potter client, they started a cafe pressure up.

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And so I figured the I potter limited it.

310
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you call it?

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Should have a shop as well.

312
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

313
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm going to it now.

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hopefully.

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
All the stuff won't crash.

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay.

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Here we go.

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Cool.

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I potter lemon t-shirt.

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Excellent.

321
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That looks great.

322
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Very cool.

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay.

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, you called it the perfect time.

325
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We got your little plug in there.

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, yes.

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Matthew Bishop.com.

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Have you taken it easy, bud?

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thanks, everybody.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay.

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Take care.

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, right on.

334
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And now we're back.

335
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I guess that was enough of a transition.

336
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
As you listen to more of a promiscuous bullet.

337
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The guys do go into something that I think is really cool.

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They play Brad sucks from Brad sucks.

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He said Brad sucks.net.

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think it is.

341
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You'll see it in the production notes on the daily source code site.

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think it was actually Dave Slusher who started playing Brad sucks.

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's, you know, Brad is this guy who does everything.

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He's a one man band with no fans.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's kind of the mantra of what he's doing.

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And so we've been picking this guy up and we've been playing parts of his demos

347
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and of his, you know, what I guess they're called albums and stuff that is yet unreleased.

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But, you know, here we have an opportunity to make one of our first non-RIA stars.

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So I'm going to jump on the bandwagon.

350
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You know, you've got three podcasts playing him.

351
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Please enjoy Brad sucks.

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sounds a little bit like back sometimes a little bit like status quo.

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And you don't have to listen.

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's not bad.

355
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000

It's a dark band.

446
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's a dark band.

447
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's a dark band.

448
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a dark band.

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a dark band and it's a dark band.

450
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's a dark band.

451
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a dark band.

452
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's a dark band.

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a dark band.

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And she'll ride with the brothers and the boys

455
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And she'll ride with the boys

456
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And she'll ride with the brothers and boys

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And she'll ride with the boys

458
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And she'll ride with the boys and the boys

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And she'll ride with the boys

460
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right, sucks

461
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Dirt bag on the daily source code for Wednesday November 10th, 2004

462
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's about 10 minutes to 11pm, so I'm just going to get this one

463
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In under the wire for today

464
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's going to be busy, I mean we are so close to move date

465
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm Monday the movers come in

466
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Tuesday the movers are still here

467
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Then Wednesday Patricia is already in

468
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Actually Tuesday night Patricia flies out with her sister

469
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They're going to receive all the goods on Wednesday

470
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Christina and I stay here in the completely empty castle bar for one bed

471
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And then we fly out Thursday

472
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We're going with a private plane with our dogs

473
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And our cats to get them in at the very last minute

474
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So hopefully all the doors are closed

475
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because the cats have to stay in doors for six weeks

476
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Or whatever so they get oriented

477
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Then all of a sudden got a nice curveball

478
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Where the re-letters send a new rental agreement

479
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, because the owner had come up with some stuff

480
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He still wanted to put in there

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've never rented a house with this

482
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There's a lot of shit in there

483
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If I do anything wrong

484
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm going to jail for so long

485
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
After throw the key away

486
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's like Christ, I have to review all that

487
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What's just a pain

488
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And then on top of that

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Now the BBC has a new show called The Culture Show

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Which actually it starts the first episode

491
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It was tomorrow night on BBC 2 at 730

492
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So that's 830 European Central Time

493
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I guess they have one of these really cute hosts

494
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That host on Saturday or like the other big Saturday show

495
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Or the Sunday morning show on the BBC

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And they've got it totally set up

497
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They've got producers, they've got writers, they've got

498
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The crew, they're coming a day early, they're staying overnight

499
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They insist on coming to the castle

500
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They want to see how a podcast is done

501
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well great, it's going to be a freaking mess

502
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's going to be as real as you can get it

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because everything's in boxes

504
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Basically everything's going to be torn down around me

505
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Except for me and my laptop and my microphone

506
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And everything else will be gone

507
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So that's coming up

508
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's on Friday

509
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So Friday, I will just cut a source code and do it with them

510
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But then there's all kinds of other stuff

511
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Banking matters, just coordination

512
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And I missed a last minute guy

513
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So this is usually when I get into my crunch

514
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So if it's the podcasts are coming up a little bit late

515
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And if you're not seeing a lot of posting going on on my site

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
There you go, it's going to at least take the next week

517
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Until next Thursday

518
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And even then, the whole town we're moving to

519
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's pretty much wi-fi but

520
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, we'll have the car there

521
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a logistical nightmare late as a gentleman

522
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So anyway, new podcasts that I found

523
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The one minute tip you can find this on audio.weblogs.com

524
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Or also in ipod.org in the directory

525
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And by the way, if you're doing a podcast

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And you want to show up

527
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
If whatever you're making your RSS 2.0 feed

528
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Whether you're your podcast feed

529
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If it's not automatically pinging audio.weblogs.com

530
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You can go to audio.weblogs.com slash pingform.html

531
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
PINGFOR and pingform.html

532
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000

536
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So this is where I found one minute tip

537
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Today it's the JKL keys and Final Cut Pro

538
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, it's a short computer tip

539
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hello and welcome to the one minute tip

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
A place to pick up quick tips to make you more computer efficient

541
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In Apple's Final Cut Pro

543
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh yeah, it's right there

544
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But sometimes you just don't want to reach down and touch the mouse

545
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
When you've got your hands on the keyboard

546
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
In Apple's Final Cut Pro

547
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Here is a great tip

548
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The JK and L keys

549
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Clustered right there on your right hand

550
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And what I need like some of these keyboard shortcuts for I chat

551
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
For the video conference

552
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000

553
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000

The JK and L keys

556
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Excited your keyboard are great for moving around

557
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Inside of clips

558
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The K key will stop the playback head

559
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Okay, so you get the idea that's the one minute tip

560
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't just get the URL

561
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Moments?

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Email us at tipat1minute.com

563
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay one minute tip.com

564
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's where you can find out about

565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well, you can subscribe to the podcast

566
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't know if they have separate podcasts for separate applications

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Or platforms if there's one for macro windows

568
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Probably this is a Mac one since it's about the Final Cut Pro

569
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But it's kind of cool, you know

570
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Not the JK L keys, but that's probably an exception

571
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
More than the rule

572
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Got an email now as we move on to

573
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Concentrating on non-RIA music from Jason

574
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
From Hardcore and some of the radio

575
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Of course, the podcast

576
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Been around for almost ever since podcasting started

577
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Hold on, let me just expand the note here

578
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He says you recently proposed listeners

579
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Out here in podcasting

580
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Land, hunt down great music by indie bands

581
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And you would produce the show

582
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
However, I'd like to steer you in a different direction

583
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He says he's teamed up with the Chris at indie feed

584
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And true blues that this has major potential for promoted bands

585
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is already having talks with labels about sending us

586
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The catalogs, things are moving

587
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So that's great, sounds like they're finding

588
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
People who want to participate

589
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Participate by giving them the music

590
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And we're giving the permission to play the music

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So things are moving quickly in a positive direction

592
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So what better way to recruit help

593
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Then they want to ask for some help

594
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Pretty basically here comes

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Need you to ask people why the daily source code

596
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If anyone would be interested in helping to maintain certain indie feeds

597
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay, so if you look at the iPodder.org directory

598
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There's a number of, if you go into the music section

599
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
There's a number of independent indie feeds

600
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So he's handling the alternative modern rock channel with Chris

601
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But the more moving activity get, of course

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The more successful it will be and so he needs more people

603
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, I totally agree, you know, I think that we can have all kinds of

604
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Different subcategories at indie feeds

605
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I love the whole concept of the way indie feeds works

606
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You know, where there's basically a little start-up

607
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Before the song and it says, you know, this is where it's from

608
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
This is who these guys are about

609
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And then you hear the song

610
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And then at the end there's another tag that came from

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Which indie feed it came and what you can do with it

612
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But I still think that just like I played the Brad sucks, you know

613
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You have to have to build a little bit of a platform

614
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I won't, you know, if you guys get that set up

615
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And please anyone who wants to help contribute

616
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Just go to Hardcore and something to radio.blogspot.com

617
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And Jason, I'm sure we have to have you help out

618
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And, you know, someone wants to maintain

619
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Some of those indie feeds

620
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And we can just use more, you know, all I'll do is subscribe to them

621
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And check it out and if I find something I'll start playing it

622
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But still we got to keep playing attention to each other

623
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And make sure that we can, you know, across the board

624
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If, you know, if we're playing the same songs, you know, that's good

625
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
For at least it'll, it'll elevate something

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think. Let's see what happens with Brad sucks, you know,

627
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If you like it, you know, play it on your podcast

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's see what happens

629
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Um, now, let's see where it was. Oh, yes, this was another

630
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
promo that came in on, actually this is very cool

631
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Because we were talking about radio dramas

632
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Um, and the long came, the human dog podcast

633
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And of course, it was promoted on openpodcast.org

634
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And you've got to listen to the drama piece

635
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well, actually, this is basically a trailer of

636
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Human Dogs work in the podcasting drama sphere

637
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

638
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

639
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

640
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

641
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

642
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

643
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

644
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

645
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

646
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

647
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

648
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

649
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Um, now, let's listen to the drama

650
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And we've got to listen to the drama

651
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
of cast-drama anthology that Volgae Odeo, host by yours true.

652
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The series begins this week with the premiere of the casual absurds.

653
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I hope you enjoy your stay within the Volgae Odeo,

654
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and please feel free to produce the rest of the website.

655
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Address again is www.human-dog.com

656
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and please, dear friends, do not forget to add that dish.

657
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They're all of the way to waste those who do not end by warnings.

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I look forward to our meeting, but until that time, I am the man named Ryan.

659
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I received it into the darkness.

660
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay, so the promo is hokeyer than the shows. Seriously, you should check them out,

661
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
but I didn't want to take anything out of contact with the show itself,

662
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
but you should definitely check it out.

663
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's real drama on podcasting, and it's cool that we've got yet another category.

664
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We've got more categories being thought up and created every day

665
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that they're going to start flowing to the directory.

666
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Now, I know that iPodr1.1, the lemon stuff is out.

667
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I guess the new iPodrX is out as well with its directory integration.

668
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So if you want to read about it, just go to iPodr.org and check out the directory

669
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and how you can contribute to building that directory.

670
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So I'm pretty fried. I've got about half an hour down now.

671
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, you know what? I have now officially from the man himself,

672
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
from the base player from the band, American Heartbreak.

673
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So I'm going to have already played a couple times on the daily source code.

674
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Actually, going back more than two months ago, I think.

675
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
He gave me some of their existing CDs and the new one, which is now yet.

676
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I think it's titled This is Rock and Roll.

677
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
From that, the song that I've been playing ever since I heard it on his own podcast,

678
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Rock and Roll to Geek Show. This is the last of the superheroes.

679
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
American Heartbreak. I'm a daily source code.

680
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We've seen them on TV our whole life.

681
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Super the friends, we're the Roman stones of the larger life.

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I can be like any one I see.

683
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
All the record and the drums leave.

684
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is the whole.

685
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's the songs of cash never I see me.

686
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We are we are the last of the superheroes.

687
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We are we are the last of the superheroes.

688
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The last of the superheroes.

689
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We are the 1970s.

690
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Then all the boxes that I've dubbed tonight,

691
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Wond fabulous makes me feel happier.

692
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This life will see back up in me,

693
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Got the stars in the dream release

694
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
London, town, heaven, hell, bed sound

695
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Bowie, men, sweet

696
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
We are we are

697
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Last of the silver wheel

698
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We are we are

699
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Last of the silver wheel

700
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Last of the silver wheel

701
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
London, town, heaven, hall

702
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's the name of the stars in the dream release

703
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,000
London, town, heaven, hall

704
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The stars in the dream release

705
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
London, town, heaven, hall

706
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,500
In the savage song, no one left to call

707
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,420
No no super heroes of the 19th and 19th

708
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,140
The last time I see more heroes

709
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,740
The last time I see more heroes

710
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,340
The last time I see more heroes

711
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,740
The last time I see more heroes

712
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:36,660
We are We are The last time I see more heroes

713
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:43,760
We are We are The last time I see more heroes

714
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,180
We are We are The last time I see more heroes

715
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:57,880
We are We are The last time I see more heroes

716
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:13,880
We are, we are the last of Superheroes, the last of Superheroes, over the 1970s.

717
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Man, back in hard break, the last of the Superheroes on your daily source code.

718
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Whoops.

719
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Sorry, took off the headphones, forgot the Microsoft attached.

720
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Wednesday, November 10th, 2004.

721
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Can you hear it? Actually, I'm just going to listen to, listen to how hollow it sounds now.

722
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Now I'm walking into, listen to this.

723
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Hello.

724
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,880
One, two, see everything's empty almost in the main room.

725
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,880
And the curtains are all down.

726
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,880
We're moving on out of here, just a reminder that

727
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,880
I'm not quite sure how the source codes are going to be going for the next couple of days.

728
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,880
But I'm pretty sure I'll be able to still be able to get to my packing down this weekend.

729
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,880
And so this is one of the last times you're going to be hearing

730
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,880
the tranquil outdoors of Belgium of Flanders.

731
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
So, have a listen.

732
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Because in one week from now, it'll be a different sound.

733
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
I mean, it's quiet there as well because we're out in the sticks.

734
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
But it's going to be a different kind of quiet.

735
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I bet you we can really tell the difference.

736
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,880
So I'll just shut up for a couple of seconds here so you can hear it.

737
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Right on.

738
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Okay.

739
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Now I got to get to bed because it's past 11.

740
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,880
My body doesn't know what the hell time it is.

741
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,880
To my girlfriend, Dawn, I say, I'm still fighting the man.

742
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
She knows what I mean.

743
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:54,880
And everyone else, who I haven't raised to in a lettuce level.

744
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I'd love for you to tune in tomorrow.

745
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,880
When we bring you another daily source code, live from Flanders, Belgium.

746
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,880
As always, you can leave a comment.

747
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Adam and Cory.com.

748
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
I'm catching up on the email by the way.

749
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,880
I had a good 10 hours of computer time on the way back.

750
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:25,880
So I'm getting better in the directories about the flood with new podcasts that I potter.org.

751
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Sample all the latest podcasts.

752
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Don't forget to check out audio.weblogs.com

753
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,880
And then you can always find the latest source code to then sourcecode.com

754
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,880
And when I got some time to post and check it out on 5.4.com

755
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
I'll be back tomorrow.

756
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
We're going to another source code.

757
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,880
We're going to use our developers to get one of the ones that party together.

758
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
Take care, Adam.

759
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Our door, our door, our door.
