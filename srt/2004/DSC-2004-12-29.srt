1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's Adam Curry!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's this?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Take a PC and a microphone into the bathroom?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Not read.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The shower of pure intellect.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you have good light Adam and drink the show?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Cheers.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The shower.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hey everybody, welcome to your daily source code.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's coming to you once again from Surrey.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Surrey.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Adam Curry and Surrey never in a hurry.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's from the Curry Cottage in the United Kingdom.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today is Wednesday, December 29th, 2004.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Once again a full full show for you at the time of recording.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Although I don't know if I should tell you that every single time.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But it's kind of midday.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's 11.30.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We have some friends dropping by.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Actually, they should have been here about half an hour ago.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So I said, fuck, I'm going to start the show.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And if they show up, they'll just actually hear the dogs barking now.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You know that when I start the show, that's when they come.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Right?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Screw it.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They're going to have to wait for 40 minutes.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
As will you because for the next 40 minutes, the source code is

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Chock Full with new podcast, pod save music and general diarrhea of the mouth from me.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've been actually had a great sleep last night.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We went to bed on time.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, it was 11.30.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That was real early for us.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We've been going to bed so late, of course, to Christine.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That still doesn't start school until next week, mid next week.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I was up real early this morning, up around.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
See, I woke at six o'clock and kind of slumbered around until seven.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Got up, let the dogs out, let the cats out and set down.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And watch the sun rise over the downs.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I've posted a link to a picture of the downs before on my weblog.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's just beautiful.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just beautiful.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But then, of course, all the shit sets in, right?

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because wow, you hear that?

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've had this problem with maybe if I just quit my email application.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems like that is somehow screwing up the recording sometimes.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In fact, you should probably quit all applications when recording a podcast.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Directed this.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So the day start off great.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was beautiful.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was drinking my tea.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I could see the animals, frolicing in the back.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You know, looking at other people on the downs through the gate.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And then, of course, I read the news that we are now up to a death toll of almost 70,000 people.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is, this just boggles my brain.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's hard to fit this in 70,000 people.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You know, when we thought that 9-11 was bad or the great Chicago fire or, you know,

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tiananmen Square or, I mean, God, it's so hard to imagine.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And you know what's going to climb?

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know, I'm not sure exactly how they count this or how they do that.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But you know what's going to go up to 100,000.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I'm dumbfounded.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know what to do.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I mean, of course, immediately I gave money to Red Cross.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sure that you've probably done that as well.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a reputable organization.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know that your money is going to be spent well.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But it's got to be a drop in the fucking bucket.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And how many people are affected?

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You know, how many people will you know that lost someone in this great tragedy?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I bet you it's going to be more than you can imagine.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I got an email from Lou Josephs, who's been a weblogger for quite a while.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's also a broadcast guy.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think he still lives in DC or in the Virginia area.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He says, Jonathan, I have a great friend on the island.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know which island that.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A Sri Lanka.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sorry.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's also a ham radio operator.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Old technology.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it works when the podcast doesn't details on his blog and on Mark's blog.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So they've actually had some contact.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I've obviously put a link in to, to lose weblog from the production show notes.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Something about the show notes.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you don't mind me just skipping over the 70,000 dead.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Jesus Christ.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know what to do yet.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Something about the show notes briefly though.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was talking to Dave last night.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And we've had some great conversations in the past couple days.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's almost every single day and he'll call up.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You know, I kind of know where he is because I try to follow along with scripting news.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In fact, I've learned that it's best to make sure I've read scripting news before I talk to him.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because, you know, he presumes sometimes that I've read that.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And vice versa by the way.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come on in.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Come on in.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They're here.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm doing my podcast.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I thought they were here.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come in.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come in.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You just had your coffee, right?

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, but are you offering me another one?

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I have chocolate sponge cake.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I have an offer of...

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What do you have on sale today, Pat?

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Chocolate sponge cake and cheesecake.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Strawberry cheesecake.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, you don't want to leave the cheesecake whole until the guests come.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We first going to taste it.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Could you please bring me some cheesecake?

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How it is.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why don't you?

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We'll check it to see if it's good.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'd love some cheesecake.

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a chocolate cake.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's wonderful.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now the cheesecake will be gone.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I'd love...

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, thank you.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is this?

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What?

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is lovely service.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is this always here in the cottage?

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Really?

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What do I have to do for that?

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You know?

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, boy.

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was just talking about the 70,000 people.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, yeah.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The fuck are we going to do about this shit?

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And why?

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why?

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay.

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thanks.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't deserve it.

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, of course I don't deserve that.

152
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The fuck is that?

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's horrible.

154
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who's God?

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Can you close the door, huh?

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Thanks.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Who's God?

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Did that?

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's what I'd like.

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'd like George Bush to stand up and say...

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This was not our God who did this.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'd like the Buddhists to stand up and say...

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is not our God.

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or maybe some God will take responsibility for it.

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Please.

166
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And the God casters, which, you know, I have great respect for the God casters, pod casters, who

167
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
are doing religious podcasts.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We have quite a bit of them in the iPodod.org directory.

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Where's the explanations?

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where's Reverend Tim and tell me why?

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why, why, why?

172
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'd like to know why.

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If there ever was a time for religion,

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to make a statement, good or bad, this is the time.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is the time.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I wonder if that's going to happen.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hold on.

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let me just reset my audio hijack pro here.

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I told you this is such a weird problem to have this latency.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And everyone has it one way or the other.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you're doing digital broadcasts and you've got stuff...

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Chained together, you're going to run into that.

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, I hope you hook up with the guys from...

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What is it, amoeba?

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Rogue amoeba software?

186
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait, who makes audio hijack pro?

187
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Is that Rogue amoeba?

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Rogue amoeba.

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

191
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Anyway.

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So, I'm just dumbfounded.

193
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know what to say.

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I really don't.

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I wish there was something that podcasting could do to...

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
To make it better.

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
To make the hurt go away, to help these people.

198
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't think there is.

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think the easiest, simplest form that we've come up with...

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Of ways to help people is to send money.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And...

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know, I don't think that an early warning system putting that in...

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And by the way, you know, this could happen in the North Atlantic.

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This could happen in the Pacific.

205
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It could happen in the North Sea.

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You know, what's the Star Wars plan for that?

207
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, and will we have enough money to implement that?

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I say we, because...

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I figure I'm pretty much living on American soil in the UK.

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
By the way, I've noticed that...

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
People in the UK actually like youngs.

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's changed a little bit.

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think in the past that used to be...

214
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There were some apprehension.

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think that there's...

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know what it is.

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know.

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Maybe it's just American culture has steeped in.

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Or maybe we've come to terms.

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Or maybe because we're fighting side by side in Iraq.

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know.

222
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know what it is.

223
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But...

224
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I feel very welcome here in the United Kingdom.

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I seriously...

226
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I really, really do.

227
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And it's so nice to have so many people sending me free little emails.

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know, about the corkiness of the UK, helping me out with learning the culture.

229
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Man, it's...

230
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's really...

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a great thing.

232
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's appreciated.

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right.

234
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your source code.

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Always looking at what's going on.

236
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Where users and developers party together.

237
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
One of our big users...

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Are the lascivious bitties.

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I got a beautiful email from Leon from the bitties.

240
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I thought I'd send you a message of solidarity.

241
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
On vacation for Christmas, first in Omaha,

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
then in Brooksville, Florida.

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In Omaha, I had a kinko's with Timo Wawireless,

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but here in Brooksville, no rental car.

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No wireless opportunity and only dial up.

246
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thirsty for podcasts.

247
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can't wait to get home to hear what you've been talking about over the holidays.

248
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Just a message of solidarity, at least we have cable and pound cake.

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Be well.

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Leon, thank you very much, Leon.

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We got cheesecake here.

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And actually, I've been learning to live.

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This Wi-Fi thing is getting us much closer to ubiquity of broadband.

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because yesterday, you know, that I rushed off after I finished the source code

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to go pick up Christina's friend at the airport.

256
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And I just grabbed the laptop with me, had it encoding on the back seat.

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We'll talk about that in a second.

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And when I got to the airport, I had to go to the departures level

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because there was no Wi-Fi available on the arrivals level.

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Go figure.

261
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's where everybody is sitting and waiting the most, you know,

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
beautiful opportunity.

263
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And was able to just hop right onto the, onto the T-Mobile wireless.

264
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
In fact, it's a, I should have taken a picture of it.

265
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a huge sign at Heathrow, a terminal 1, 2 and 3.

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That says, you know, T-Mobile, the world's largest W-Lan network,

267
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
which is a big statement to make, but you know what?

268
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They are out there.

269
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And it's getting to the point.

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Just look at what Dave, what Dave Winner is witnessing.

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He bought a truck stop.

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Wireless subscription.

273
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is great.

274
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And he says that only in a couple of months since the last time he drove coast to coast

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
has he seen, you know, the ubiquity really, really pop up.

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There's almost, you can get a Wi-Fi almost anywhere.

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So getting pretty damn good.

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And of course, because you can get Wi-Fi almost anywhere,

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you can get some excellent dropcated since this time.

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's a hit.

281
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Remember this one.

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There's a University of Michigan, I believe.

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There's a University of Michigan, I believe.

284
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You remember I'd asked for some hits?

285
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Remember I'd asked for some hits.

286
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:44,720
That was the, oh shit, I messed up the last bit home on shit.

287
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
That was the widest version of Slupia, I've ever heard of.

288
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, this very squinger.

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's very square.

290
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Patricia just walked back in where the great announcement here.

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, no, no.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was just thinking, I was downstairs, the whole house is nice.

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I cleaned up everything.

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
All right.

295
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because we wanted to show the new cottage and the house smells nice.

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have candles on and you know, a little bit of papery here.

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh, curry, everybody.

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And you know what?

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because we're ready for them.

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

301
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And always, and I know people who have cats know this.

302
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Mm-hmm.

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They go to the kitty's house.

304
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Just before you guess.

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
They pooped.

306
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They go on the kitty's box.

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because they don't like the smell.

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They don't like our smell.

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They don't like papery.

311
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They don't like all your candles.

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They have their own papery.

313
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All right.

314
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Isn't it always the same?

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Han, you know what?

316
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

317
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You can come in here anytime to talk about poop.

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I want you to know that.

319
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm so happy.

320
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Anything poop related is good in my book.

321
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm a vegetable.

322
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

323
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Love you, Han.

324
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let me know when they're here.

325
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah.

326
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh, lovely.

328
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Thank you very much by the way for the wonderful drum cadence.

329
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
More hits, more hits, please.

330
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
More hits.

331
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yesterday, I mentioned that I thought that I had solved the entire encoding issue of not being able to play this show on certain palm devices.

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I disabled the filter selection on the lame brain MP3 encoder.

333
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If you don't know what I'm talking about, skip ahead one minute or listen to yesterday's podcast.

334
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So I set it now.

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I deselected all of the filters and set it at 44.1 kilohertz.

336
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I got a lot of comments.

337
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mainly people saying, please change it back to whatever it was because we could hear all this warmably noise.

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because I guess lame brain does have a lot of really cool filters in there that that really processes the sound.

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So today I've tried it differently.

340
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm setting it to 22.050, which should that's a sample rate for the audio, which should work on the palms.

341
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And it should also sound good.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because I've left the filters in.

343
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, let me know because I agree yesterday sounded really warbly.

344
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't quite what I was looking for.

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
New podcast.

346
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Finally, I'm able to create a book category on ipod.org because we have the brand new bound cast.

347
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Fitting a new revolutionary medium like podcasting.

348
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We'd like our first book to be about a revolution in itself.

349
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So our first book is Revolution in the Valley, which is Andy Hertzfeld's book about the development of the Macintosh.

350
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
From all the way from when he was first hired at Apple.

351
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Through the development of Macintosh itself.

352
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And then all the way into the Scully crew of that ended John's first term.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And it's a great start-up story.

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's got lots of light hours and pizza by the ton.

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And you know, strange characters and weird happenings and things like that.

356
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And it's organized into a hundred short stories.

357
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And they're all well-written and quick to read.

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I read the whole book, kind of covered a cover in about three hours.

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You know, that's why you could freak with the sort of stuff.

360
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'd love this story.

361
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The development of the Macintosh for me is the ultimate, you know, expression of passion.

362
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Where the people who worked on it were all just brilliant.

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And it's kind of a story that inspired my whole career.

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I think that applies for a lot of us.

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What's interesting, I think, about the book, is that it shows that the development wasn't anything unusual.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You think about how Revolutionary the outcome wasn't, you think, wow, you know, to be involved in that,

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
was just been insane.

368
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But because the model of the development with the late hours and that dot-com insanity has been reused so many times,

369
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
a lot of what they went through is very similar to what we went through today.

370
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And it's inspiring in a way.

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's inspiring to see that at the end, all of that, you can do something revolutionary and change the world.

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And this was one of the very first times when that happened in the computer industry.

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And Andy's really captured that feel in this book.

374
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So for me, this is a five out of five star book, of course.

375
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I think that if you're going to return some books or return some gifts,

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that you got, you might want to go and take this book out as an exchange.

377
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So there you have it, our first book review.

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Five out of five stars for Andy Hertzfeld's Revolution in the Valley.

379
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, dude, most excellent.

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The bound cast, a little bit soft on the audio there.

381
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I tried to crank it up as much as possible.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Great mic sound.

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And God, I love having a book review that lasts two minutes and 30 seconds.

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That is perfect.

385
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And I guarantee you that eventually will sell some books.

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I bought it out or directory.

387
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can go to the books node brand new node.

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And just select that.

389
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I guarantee you will not regret it.

390
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hello.

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Hi, Mr. Curry.

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, hold on.

393
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's agree on one thing, everybody.

394
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's agree.

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We don't call me Mr. Curry.

396
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Um, that makes me feel the 40 years I am.

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Vote podcasting.

398
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I just got my 40 gig about.

399
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I pod for my 21st birthday on the 9th of December.

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

401
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Now I see why you're calling me Mr. Curry.

402
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
21.

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Higher time from then until about the 20th getting my library organized.

405
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Then I heard about podcasts.

406
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Sorry.

407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was a little slow on the news, but once I did get iPodter, I took to it like a fake.

408
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And let me tell you something about the iPods.

409
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I bought an iPod mini for Christina.

410
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And configuring these things on Windows is not snap, you know, snap crackle pop easy

411
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
123.

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No way.

413
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You know, it's got a reformat itself.

414
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You've got to actually it has to be a little bit charged before you can connect it.

415
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And then you have to disconnect it from from the install process, plug it into the firewire

416
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
plug that plugs into the wall outlet or to the adapter so that it can reboot its firmware.

417
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a fucking horrible process.

418
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And in the Netherlands, and I have received multiple calls about this.

419
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There is no Dutch user guide.

420
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You don't even give you a fucking English user guide.

421
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Now, they're dumping these iPod mini from either Germany and or France because that's the only two

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
user guides user manuals that it comes with is with a French one and a German one.

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And it's complicated.

424
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You know, if you don't have a Mac, we just plug it in and the shit works.

425
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You've got to figure it out by yourself.

426
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And if there's no Dutch user manual or even an English one for that matter,

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
sure, you can download it from Apple.com.

428
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Sure.

429
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's not the point.

430
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Not when you pay that kind of money for an iPod mini.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've been helping so many people doing a basic phone support trying to help them

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
rig up their iPod mini.

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's wacky.

434
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's not an easy install process.

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In fact, it reminded me a lot of the first iPodders.

436
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Jesus Christ is so hard.

437
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So, of course, what we'd want in the future would be obviously to have the iPod

438
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
or built into the iPod.

439
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And do I have that list?

440
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I was going to talk about that today, wasn't I?

441
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
About, yeah, I'm going to talk about iPodzilla, of course.

442
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I have your show, Dawn and Drew Show, Leo LePortz, Pack Report, really learned Spanish

443
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and a whole bunch of others.

444
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So, I'm always listening to the podcast.

445
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Either way, I really want to start my own.

446
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm kind of used to the blog thing because I do a mobile blog on textamerica.com

447
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and I have the link in my email.

448
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But sorry to bore you with the introduction.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know how to explain where I'm coming from.

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Basically, I want some pointers from, you know,

451
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the father of podcasts and passmaskers.

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Okay, if you go to iPod.org,

453
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
hold on a second.

454
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm getting that frickin' delay again.

455
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If you go to iPod.org in the directory,

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
there's a documentation node.

457
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can find all the links you need right there.

458
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It really is the resource for,

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
what they've put on that, the resource for the iPod platform.

460
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
By the way, they've also father of,

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the podcast, please.

462
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The internet.

463
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Don Maselli.

464
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Mother of the internet.

465
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Could please.

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
On how I can get started.

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay, no problem at all.

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Just go to iPod.org.

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's where all the resources are that you need.

470
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I guarantee that's exactly where you're going to find it.

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Glad to see, by the way, that Dave got his audio fixed.

472
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That crapping out was apparently caused by,

473
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
how shoot, what was that thing that automatically

474
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
records radio broadcast for him?

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That was apparently what was causing all the hiccups

476
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
in his recordings.

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I'm glad he got that fixed.

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And he put up a test podcast.

479
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hopefully we'll get some more from the road

480
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
from him today or tomorrow.

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My God, what are we 20 minutes in this?

482
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I have no idea how I'm going to finish the entire show today.

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's see.

484
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We have another first recording here.

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You know, Adam, JT here, soon to be podcaster.

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Just trying to test out my rig here and send you a little note.

487
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I heard that Carlin thing you played the other day

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and just laughing hysterically.

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But just wanted to voice a little support.

490
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let you know you're doing a fantastic job pushing this.

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And I buy into your vision completely.

492
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
In fact, I plan on starting two podcasts.

493
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
One kind of dedicated towards technology for the business user.

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And that's kind of like my business slant, so to speak.

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And second one being geared towards frankly beer and wine.

496
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah.

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
All right, screw the technology.

498
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
All right, finally another beer podcast beer and wine.

499
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Got a little bit lesser expensive wines for the masses.

500
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And doing a bit of beer brewing and sharing those experiences online.

501
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's unbelievable.

502
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
There are at least four beer podcasts.

503
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This is big, big stuff.

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This, this almost as big as religion.

505
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm telling you, large circles of friends and all that.

506
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And they're all totally hyped about what's going on with podcasting.

507
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So keep up the great work.

508
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I won't keep this short.

509
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So you won't have all kinds of bad download times.

510
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You know what's nice about about the bandwidth when you send something through email.

511
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Excuse me, as long as I don't have my mailbox full up, fill up.

512
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Over night, everything comes in.

513
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If you send it the end of the day in the States,

514
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to have it the next morning.

515
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It'll be already down.

516
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's kind of like an email iPodder.

517
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's really, it's quite incredible.

518
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So anyway, great can't wait to see you come along with with yet another beer podcast.

519
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I love beer podcast as much as I love coffee.

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was talking about the sense sale the other day.

521
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Wondering if that was for sale in the States.

522
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
A couple of comments.

523
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Of course, all of these listed on the on the show notes.

524
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
From Jennifer.

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A sense sale machine is on sale in the States.

526
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In fact, she says, my mom got me one for Christmas.

527
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Love it, love it, love it.

528
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And Joan sent me an email, which was actually almost even cooler.

529
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
She says it Christmas, my parents came over.

530
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
A lot of talk about geeky and geek and tech stuff.

531
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They talk about her internet business.

532
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And she says, check this out.

533
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
My dad happens to be the developer of the electronics and processing unit of the sense sale.

534
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And he retired just a couple of weeks ago.

535
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And was actually received a highly tweaked sense sale completely made of aluminium.

536
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We need a picture of that, Joan.

537
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I want to see the the pimped out sense sale machine.

538
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And by the way, I've learned here in the UK it is aluminium.

539
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Not aluminum, as we say in the States, aluminium.

540
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I've been corrected on my.

541
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
In fact, the English are great at correcting.

542
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, at correcting English.

543
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Another excellent email here from Jim Davis, who says that he just received his February 5th

544
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Mac addict.

545
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's the magazine.

546
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It has in there a nine step procedure.

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I didn't know it was nine steps.

548
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I think it could be shorter than that.

549
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
A nine step procedure on podcasting.

550
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And the disk, they always send a companion disk has all the software that you need to start

551
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
to podcast.

552
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So of course, I haven't seen this yet the Mac addict.

553
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I will pick up a copy as soon as I can get my hands on it.

554
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So in there is BB edit.

555
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm not sure.

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Well, I guess BB edit too.

557
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Maybe to create your RSS file.

558
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Does BB edit 8.0.2 have a template for RSS files?

559
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's probably it.

560
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'll have to look.

561
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I potter X2.2, excellent guys.

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Line in, which is from Rogumi, this software.

563
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's a free way to basically get the mic going on your computer, on your Mac and record it.

564
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Soundflower and transmit, which is I think an FTP client.

565
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't know if you necessarily need that.

566
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I mean, basically you can use some blog software and it will get you to the same place.

567
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But kudos to the iPod or X guys for getting that kind of distribution.

568
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's freaking awesome.

569
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So great to see podcasting being propagated once again.

570
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And speaking of Mac, Phil Terone says that he's been using a media center PC 2005.

571
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And an Xbox media center extender kind of as an iPodter.

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And he's posted a link about it on in gadget.com.

573
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So I put that link in the show notes as well for you to check out if you're interested.

574
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Something about the show notes that Dave and I discussed in our talk yesterday.

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I said, how many times do you check out the production show notes?

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
He says zero, never checked him ever.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So why is that?

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He says well because if I wanted to check the notes, then I would have to be there at that moment.

579
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So I would be talking about something he should be able to pick up the iPod and somehow get to that.

580
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Which I think we're totally be a function of OPML.

581
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But then he said something that kind of scared me.

582
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because he says, I don't know where, well, he was, of course he knows where the show notes live.

583
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But he says, you know, when I do my aggregator scan, the show notes don't pop up.

584
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He says, what he would want and this is what kind of freaking out is a way to scan the show notes to make a decision on whether he wants to listen to the show or not.

585
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This is a very frightening thing for a broadcast or a podcaster for that matter.

586
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Makes no difference for any communicator.

587
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Because it's like judging a book by its cover, which means that not only do I have to now make a great podcast,

588
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but I have to make a great show notes as well in order to make sure that people check it out.

589
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So actually, I've decided, I don't want people checking out my show notes.

590
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I want them to listen to the podcast.

591
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The podcast will have a theme, will have a title, maybe one or two notes in the ID3 tags.

592
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Of course, you should be able to get to the show notes to go back and check that if you really need something like the next song I'm going to play.

593
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You want some information on Barry Coral.

594
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You need to figure out where to get it.

595
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But I don't like this idea of checking it before the podcast.

596
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
In fact, that freaks me out.

597
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And I know because it's like the TV guide.

598
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
If you knew it was on the news, of course you know what's going to be on the news.

599
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But if you really knew it's going to be on the news and they promoted that and they gave you the whole rundown,

600
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
not just the highlights, would you watch the news or would you scout around or would you look at the competition?

601
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I think you would.

602
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I think you would.

603
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So I'm not too sure about putting all the topics of a show into the show notes.

604
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I like it from production from a production standpoint.

605
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So for instance, Michael Butler played a song that he received on CD the other day.

606
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Podsafe music. He actually built it as Podsafe music in a rock and roll geek show.

607
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And he played it.

608
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And what I'd like is I'd like to be able to get that song.

609
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In fact, I'd like my, you know, to be able to just click something and get his production notes and click on that song and be able to take the entire song and put it into my podcast without.

610
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It will be beautiful.

611
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I didn't even have to download it if it was kind of just all there.

612
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But it doesn't matter.

613
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If I could just drag and drop that into my, into my production console, that would be enough for me.

614
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But I'm definitely freaked out about, you know, this is what's on the show because you do get the judge book by its cover.

615
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And maybe we'll get there anyway, so maybe we have to learn how to write better show notes.

616
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That could be possibly, you know, just the way it is.

617
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In fact, have you ever noticed that if you, it's almost impossible to get the rundown of Letterman and Leno at the same time.

618
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because you'll start, I think I used to do it.

619
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'd start out with Letterman and, you know, and then switch after the first two names of Letterman because those will be his top guess switch over to Leno in the intro to see if you can see who's going to be on Leno show.

620
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And it's very hard because they, they promote everything almost at exactly the same second.

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So you kind of got to make a decision beforehand.

622
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And maybe people do make decisions, maybe it's based upon the decisions of the promos.

623
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I don't know.

624
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't know.

625
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Anyway, just in the mail.

626
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
What are we at?

627
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Geez, only 10 more minutes.

628
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm never going to make it.

629
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Okay.

630
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In the mail today, I finally got the brand new CD by Barry Coral.

631
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We actually played something, what do we play, aspiring angel a couple days ago.

632
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Beautiful note, Adam, hope you're well.

633
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I've gotten some really nice emails from your listeners.

634
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Thanks for all your support.

635
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We'll smiley face from Barry Coral.

636
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Confessions of an indie girl is the title of the CD.

637
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
One of the songs I liked a lot was midnight trained at Georgia, her rendition.

638
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm not going to play that because I want to play something that she wrote herself.

639
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This is a song I like from her CD.

640
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
This is the world you call home.

641
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I guess it's a planetary premiere everybody on the Daily Source Code, Barry Coral.

642
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, they got your down in your home town.

643
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They tell you when.

644
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
They tell you how.

645
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They find solutions and institutions and things.

646
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
To keep your back.

647
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah, I'm not going to hit them.

648
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Someone here has been in your shoes.

649
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the don't.

650
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They're buying some comfort from your blue.

651
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Have your listen to your radio.

652
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And pull it off a stereo.

653
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I hear it on your own.

654
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
All out of the world you call home.

655
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Well, she broke your heart in a million parts.

656
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And there's no ceremony for the venue.

657
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So now you just move in the talk where the light can catch you.

658
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I just want to hear from someone who's been in your shoes.

660
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the don't.

661
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They're buying some comfort from your blue.

662
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And you listen to your radio.

663
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And pull it off a stereo.

664
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I hear it on your own.

665
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
All out of the world you call home.

666
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You know you found someone who's shrink up for you.

670
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And you listen to your mv3 player.

677
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

678
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

679
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

680
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,080
and V3 player. The world you call home, Barry Coral, from a brand new CD,

681
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,360
conversions of an indie girl, check it out and find out where you actually buy this CD. I'd

682
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,880
say Barry Coral.com, B-A-R-I-K-O-R-A-L. Or as we say in the aviation world,

683
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:58,080
so do it. Bravo Alpha Romeo, India, Kilo, Oscar Romeo, AlphaLima.com. Tomorrow I'll play some more

684
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,360
from Barry Coral. Really digging that CD. It's some of it's downbeat, some of it's slow,

685
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,320
but there's some real good uptempo tunes, and I think tomorrow I'll play the midnight train to Georgia.

686
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,280
I love her rendition of that. It's really cool. Okay, got a little more time that I've budgeted at

687
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,520
least because I don't want to keep you wait and longer than you have to on finishing up the goddamn

688
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,960
show. Podzilla. Talk about this yesterday about loading Linux on your iPod, and once I got back

689
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,000
and after I'd picked up Christina's friend, I did it. I installed Linux on my iPod. It was really

690
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,560
easy. You know, download of the application, click it, select it my iPod, it installed. It's a dual boot

691
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:49,040
if you can believe it. So when I crank up the iPod, I can choose whether to boot into Linux,

692
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,400
or I can choose if I want to go into the regular iPod system. I said like 10 gigs left or the

693
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,720
40 gigs. So basically when you boot into Linux, there's 10 gigs sitting there. Just waiting to be used.

694
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,360
All the executable files are in there. It's amazing. I think this is just the beginning. I think a

695
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,520
lot has to be done, but this is the first time actually the ship was working. I could scroll through

696
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,800
songs that were already on there by the way. In the other memory space that I guess it's

697
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,480
somehow knows how to see that. And I could play them. Of course, a lot of the stuff that you've

698
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,440
come to know and love about the iPod like power management, it turned off automatically. It doesn't

699
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,160
do that in Linux mode, but damn, we've got some really smart people working on this stuff developing.

700
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,040
And I'm going to follow it. I'm going to keep all the updates going. I'm very excited about this,

701
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,760
because if you can get an operating system on to an MP3 player, we could maybe route around

702
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:51,840
everybody and just make what we like. And please check out iPod.org where Dave started a conversation

703
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,040
about, you know, what's wrong with the iPod? What can we do to make it better? And there's lots

704
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,280
of people sending in all kinds of smart ideas. And now we actually might be able to to bring those

705
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,400
ideas to life. One of them, of course, is recording on the iPod. Not in this crappy eight

706
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,440
kilohertz sample bitrate that the built in and I'm Mike and whatever, you know, that they produce

707
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,880
standard out of the box with the iPod. But now you can go up to 96 kilohertz sample rate.

708
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,440
And the guy that turned me on to this is Ford Bailey. And Ford was nice enough to send

709
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,720
executive done it myself, but he sent me a recording that he made on his iPod. Listen to the quality.

710
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,840
Hey Adam, Ford Bailey here. And I'm recording on my iPod at 44.1 kilohertz. 44.1, but you do.

711
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,040
You know, it's unlocked the potential of the iPod for recording this iPod Linux has,

712
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,960
because Apple won't let you record it. I think it's eight kilohertz, which is fucked up.

713
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,640
And, you know, where the artists now, we need to be able to record our shit, right?

714
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,680
Yeah, going. Try iPod Linux out and try the recording. It'll record Mike or

715
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,080
line in beautiful. So you can use it as a recording device from from your power book or whatever.

716
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,880
And it's not invasive install. You can install it alongside your original iPods operating system.

717
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,800
So it's, uh, it's pretty easy.

718
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,800
Give it up. You're warranty may be void. And no, we're prohibited by law.

719
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,120
And, uh, it's put the word so that we can get, you know, development to speed up on this project,

720
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,800
because that will, you know, we have open source software on iPod. We'll be probably be better off.

721
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,960
Thank you. No kidding. And then how far off is?

722
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,200
Okay. Thanks buddy. And how far off is, uh, is the eye river from there? You know, or any other

723
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,160
MP3 player? I mean, is it? I don't know. I don't know why you can, maybe the iPod can do this,

724
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,080
because it has, you know, a disconnect. So it has a discontroller and all kinds of stuff. I don't

725
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,800
know anything about this, but totally, totally exciting to it. Even just to boot up and see your boot up

726
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,240
sequence, you know, if, if you've ever seen Linux boot up, uh, or if you, um, if you boot up your

727
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,520
Mac and you press, uh, Apple key V for verbose, it'll give you the same start up. You see all the

728
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,200
BSD stuff, and it's real geeky, right? But I love seeing that on my iPod.

729
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,200
Yeah, it's exactly. It's time for what is a day number nine of our 12 days of podcasting.

730
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Eight review movies, seven torrent seating, a six pack of hanging,

731
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:54,080
three goofy coke, two punks of cousin and closures in an XML tree. Yeah, okay. If that doesn't do it for you,

732
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,920
then maybe tomorrow's installment will. Musicians, we're not all musicians. That's for sure.

733
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,960
All right, everybody in the kitchen, sing on now. Take it up back. Take your hat for new

734
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,120
music. Take your hat. All making me laugh. Yeah, everybody. Morning, noon, and night.

735
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,160
Good night, internet.

736
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,840
Who are my kids just now? That's it for the source code for today for Thursday, December 29th.

737
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,760
So I didn't get to everything I wanted to talk about today, but that's good because I had some

738
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,960
stuff left over for tomorrow, uh, which we're talking about, and that will make it, uh, Thursday,

739
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:38,400
the 30th almost the end of the year, and only five more days away from absolute total mega

740
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:47,440
bandwidth at the cottage. As always, comments are more than welcome at adamantcurry.com.

741
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,680
If you want to send an audio comment or song or anything, if it's under five meg, it's just a

742
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,800
touch it, send it off tonight, and it'll be there waiting for me in the morning. I'm off to Starbucks

743
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,440
to shoot this one up to the bird. As we used to say in the radio biz, and of course,

744
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,720
the download all the latest stuff, because so many new podcasts every single day between 10 and 20

745
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,080
new ones listed on ipodder.org, which is populating throughout the entire net, got to love it.

746
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,600
All right, everybody. Take care. See you tomorrow. Bye, bye.
