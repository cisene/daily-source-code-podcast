1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Do you like people?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
No I don't.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Do you like all kinds of people?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No I don't.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's wonderful.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Do you like adult films and other visual material?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm looking for a book and television.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Steadily expanding correctional.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I think we can help it.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You do?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's good.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There are just a number of positions.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You will find that there can be great variety and interest.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But you will be rewarded with real pleasure television.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
People like you.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
On wheels.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Did you get me an advertiser?

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't understand a quote.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm asteroid.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And it's like a medic head.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a quote.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let me answer for the order.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A yes doctor.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here it is.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, and though everybody.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Talking in undertones here.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Because I don't want to make up my fellow passengers.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We are on British Airways flight 442 from San Francisco to London with continuing service

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to Amsterdam the Netherlands.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The power of the intercourse.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So this is the, I'm a way home from blogger condition of the show.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But also we have to tone down the energy.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But I really can't be screaming here.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sitting in my seat.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I've got everything all hooked up.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've got the laptop, cracked open.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The AC power is the wide plugged in.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I can get 110 volts out of the power of the laptop.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm holding onto my microphone.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And it is dark.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Anyway, let's see.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It is.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's the show for.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is for Tuesday.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, for Wednesday.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
For Tuesday the night.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For the hour.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The hour.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The hour.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The hour.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, that's what I meant.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's Tuesday.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
November 9th.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
2004.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In London right now it is 2.30 pm.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I ended up on another hour and a half of flying to do.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay.

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So it really, really sucked.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Major league.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But my flight was supposed to be SFO at 7.30.

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And hang out with Don and Drew.

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We went to tower records.

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Pick up some stuff for Christina.

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Of course.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And we had some coffee with Robert's goal.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He was hanging out with us as well.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then Robert went to Microsoft.

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Microsoft to go to work and Dawn Drew and I 1-0 to Stanford to meet up with James.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And we're talking about James on trade secrets.

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's their friend to guy with the cool big low piercings.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It was like a shotgun made the holes.

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so he's at the super genome sequencing establishment.

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And that got a little tour of everything that he's got.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That was absolutely amazing.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That is a sun.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Super computer that.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It was almost like.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So I want to take into a sunwork station and just, you know,

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
blown it up by, I don't know, 200 times the size was unbelievable.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And from there I grabbed a cab to the airport.

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My flight was at 7.30.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I arrived perfectly around 5 o'clock.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I only defined out that the flight was delayed.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It wasn't leaving until 10 o'clock.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, well, luckily, luckily, luckily, luckily.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wi-Fi, probably available.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And I was able to chill out in the lounge.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And download everything.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I had been able to download it at the right height.

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because of poor Wi-Fi.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I did tell them that by the way, I'm away out.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I was checking out.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I said, you know, I really had a good time here and enjoyed it very much.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But, you know, you really should do something about your Wi-Fi.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And he was going at all.

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But you knew that a bridge for better receptionist,

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I said, look, I'm technical.

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's your provider.

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You know, it's just, it was not good.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And he said, well, did you call them?

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And now, now, I'm telling you.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And I don't know if they'll ever get that fixed.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That would be a reason not to stay at the height in the future.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Otherwise, I liked it.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I liked it very much.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So, blogger con.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, man.

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We had a good time.

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not going to make this source code too long.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think the polygons are bringing breakfast by in a second.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I don't know if that, well, I won't have room to have breakfast

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and keep the laptop open.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And there are priorities, you know.

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I want to talk a little bit about the trip.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I had to have some stuff to play for you.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was able to queue some stuff up.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not everything that I'd want to, and tomorrow, when I kind of get turned around,

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
there's so much cool stuff in podcast-wise that you've got to hear.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It really is just so much coming out, including radio dramas.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And it's just awesome, awesome stuff.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But for today, a couple of things that I did find, you know, hanging around the net.

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We didn't really have much chance to talk on the source code about the results of the election,

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but there's always something to play.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I know I'm doing it.

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I just just let me do it, alright?

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I'm the type of guy who sees life in black and white.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You know I think it's better to be certain to be right.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I took financial surplus and got rid of all that green.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
To grow the greatest deficit, the world has ever seen that call me the squander.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The squander.

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll take a stab and down and down and down and down and down.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, there's tragedy in Washington and New York and PA.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thousands gone, wars begun, got to make someone pay.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The goodwill of the world is something I flushed out on the dream.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
When I said, forget oh, silent.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go get sedan who's saying, they call me the squander.

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The squander.

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll take a stab and down and down and down.

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, well, I go from state to state.

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll along that campaign trail and I'll avoid a true debate.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because the more you look, the more you'll see.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I was born to fail, oh, I'm the type of guy who decide in every bush.

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I know what I want when I point a judge.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The billarights have surely seemed a good thing at the time.

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now take those civil liberties.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Put them where the sun doesn't shine.

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They call me the squander.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The squander.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll take a stab and down and down and down and down.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, I go from state to state.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm making water out of wind.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And the people disagree.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll close my ears or else.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You'll see me start to scowl and whine.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, I'm the type of guy who will never say I'm wrong.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't bother me with facts.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm right or I belong.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My dad stayed out of Baghdad.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He was all concerned.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But what the heck does he know?

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He'll be served wonder.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
They call me the squander.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The squander.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll take a stab and down and down and down and down.

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm the squander.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The squander.

175
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll take a stab and down and down and down and down.

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Right on.

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not quite sure.

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm not sure.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not sure.

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm not sure.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I quite sure where that came from.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But clearly, very used parody of the wanderer.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The bush squanderer here on your daily source code.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And we're at, actually, I could probably check that out.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can tell you how we're doing right now.

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let me just open up my onboard video entertainment system.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There we go.

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let me turn on.

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Right now.

191
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So find out where we are.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Time to destination one hour 32 minutes.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We are 844 miles from the destination.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We've got a 96 mile per hour tailwind.

195
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And currently.

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's see.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not going to tell me how, what the altitude is.

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it'll tell me that in a second.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sure.

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
My next one here.

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We're just woke up.

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You looked at me really nicely.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She's getting some stuff out of the overhead bin.

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Ooh.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So we are.

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can see now that we're about.

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We're just underneath the Iceland right now.

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm going to tell you what our altitude is in the second.

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
About half an hour ago.

213
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I felt the descent.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They started to descend.

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's taken a long time for that to come up.

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So.

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Good one more second.

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can I just have a fucking altitude check, please?

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What's our altitude?

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Uh.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It just shows maps over and over.

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it doesn't give me the information I want.

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If it pops up, I'll let you know.

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Um.

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Blogger com.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Boy.

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Don't know where to start.

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Um.

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But I've already started to call some stuff from.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Uh.

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
From the I potter.

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Stuff that has.

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Has.

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Has.

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Come in.

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh.

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
37,000 feet.

241
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There you go.

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
About time.

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
658 miles per hour.

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's our ground speed.

245
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Good.

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Outside air temperature.

247
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Mine is 72.

248
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Who's that?

250
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It was so nice meeting everybody.

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I can't even begin to.

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
To.

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
To thank.

254
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You know.

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Everyone for all that they've been doing in podcasting and.

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And just for.

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You know, putting together an awesome.

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Session.

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
At.

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
At blogger con.

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And besides the podcasting part, just blogger con.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
General was.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Um.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It was good.

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I really enjoyed it.

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We talked about that on trade secrets.

267
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So if you haven't heard that.

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Check out secrets dot scripting dot com.

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But also met people who have been sending me stuff over the past.

270
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There are a couple of weeks and months.

271
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Including.

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Um.

273
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
An announcement about a brand new podcast.

274
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is from honey buddies.

275
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hi Adam.

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My name is.

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm about this.

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I am Mexican.

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I leave in the Bay area in California.

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In Sunnyvale.

281
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, first of all, I wanted to.

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Uh.

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Congratulations for the show.

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And so now here's a.

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Uh.

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A Boeing.

287
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But in.

288
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All right.

289
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Second of all, I want to.

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Obviously.

291
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Uh.

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Tell you that.

293
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Uh.

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
My prayers are currently offered for your mom's help.

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And all of your family as well.

296
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So that you can all get through these difficult time.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Uh.

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In the best possible way.

299
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And.

300
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
After that, I wanted to.

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Tell you that I managed to create my very own podcast.

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This one is in Spanish.

303
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I've uploaded it to my website.

304
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's www dot.

305
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Butis dot or g slash podcast.

306
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Uh.

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Butis is spelled.

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Be a symbol.

309
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
A T is in teenager.

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I.

311
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Z.

312
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, um.

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was a liberal of love.

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Took me.

315
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Uh.

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll say three hours.

317
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh.

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
To get it going.

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And man.

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You should see my setup.

321
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Um.

322
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Totally.

323
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Regimentary.

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't even have a mic.

325
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Um.

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Using my powerful G4 to do all these.

327
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And the most weird software setup in history.

328
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But.

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Anyway, managed to put it up.

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think the worst part was.

331
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Trying to figure out how to set up an RSS.

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Feed.

333
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Never done in my life.

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Had no idea.

335
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Started copying and pasting a bunch of things.

336
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I found on the web.

337
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And then actually on your site.

338
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just to get me going.

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And.

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, I don't know if it's working or not.

341
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
As a matter of fact.

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So.

343
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll appreciate if you could give it a shot.

344
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
See if that works for you.

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, I'm going to be.

346
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Uh.

347
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Right on and actually we didn't meet, which was very cool.

348
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And he was apologizing for a few sleeve for having sent this five.

349
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Uh, megabyte.

350
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Uh, audio comment through my email.

351
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It made it through the email, which is actually kind of surprising.

352
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I thought there was a five megabyte cut off.

353
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But no problem at all my brother.

354
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And it seems to be working.

355
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I love the fact that Jaime, what he did is he didn't.

356
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I didn't have a blogging tool.

357
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He just copied and pasted.

358
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And that's why RSS is really simple syndication.

359
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Because you can look at it.

360
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And you can read it.

361
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And you can understand it.

362
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And you can see what you have to do.

363
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And you can create it with a text editor.

364
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Um, and, uh, it's working.

365
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So check that out by teased.org slash podcast.

366
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Um, someone else who I was really looking forward to to meeting.

367
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Uh, at BloggerCon was Michael Butler from the Rock and Roll Geek show.

368
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And he, it was great.

369
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Um, he hooked me up with the, all the American heartbreak CDs.

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And put in the new one that hasn't come out yet, which I'm not a chance to listen to.

371
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But I'm sure you'll be hearing some music from that on, uh, on the daily source code in the future.

372
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because I do like that man.

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And Michael is exactly what I thought he would be.

374
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And, and actually even, even more satisfying than that.

375
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And he recorded, um, uh, a podcast on the evening before BloggerCon.

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Uh, at the, at the Ricky's High at, and I just wanted to play a little bit of that.

377
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because it, it really, it really tells you a lot about Michael.

378
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's cool.

379
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I went to BloggerCon yesterday.

380
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Left for the show.

381
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The show.

382
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, I guess it was kind of a show.

383
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I had a good time to felt like being in a show to me.

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I went on Friday because I got into a huge fight with my wife.

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Really uncomfortable night.

386
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So I grabbed a bunch of beer.

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Went down to Ricky's High at,

388
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
drank myself a 12 pack of Heinrich and buy myself.

389
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know if you ever sit in a hotel and buy yourself and drink yourself to sleep.

390
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But it was all right.

391
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sometimes it's kind of fun to do that.

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Plugged in my power book.

393
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Got on the internet.

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Up pops.

395
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Um, well, I don't know if you have a Mac, but if you have iTunes, if you have people who share

396
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
in their playlist, you can see their songs.

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So, uh, pops.

398
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Adam Curry's playlist and I think Dave's slushers playlist as well.

399
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So I kind of went through their stuff and see what they have.

400
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And killed the time doing that for a while.

401
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Watch a little television.

402
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Finish the 12 packs a lot past out.

403
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think it was about a half a beer left when I woke up in the morning.

404
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All my mouth was all dry.

405
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But I know it is when you pass out drunk.

406
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't do that too often.

407
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But that was one of those nights where you just have to do it.

408
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I have to talk quite now because the subject in question is in the room with me.

409
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you get my drift, I don't want to get into another fight.

410
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm going to bother by the way.

411
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The fight is pretty much over.

412
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And that was the part I wanted you to hear.

413
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
A lot of people were quite concerned about the quote fight that Michael had with his wife.

414
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So everything's okay.

415
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think he went home and painted the front of the house and kind of got out of the dog house by doing that.

416
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was nice to meet you, Michael.

417
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Matt, it was awesome and good luck with the show and with the course with the band and everything else.

418
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And he's also looking for a, for a sponsorship from Heineken.

419
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I will try to hook you up, my brother.

420
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Maybe they can't at least get you some free cans.

421
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shouldn't it be something like that at the very least?

422
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And now we're promo on the daily source code.

423
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We're on the day.

424
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Three minutes.

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Six, two seconds live.

426
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And by door five and six, don't forget to put the earphones on.

427
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Here's the microphone.

428
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There's this thing on.

429
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
30 seconds.

430
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Is that a yummy?

431
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hello?

432
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Check it.

433
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Make it up.

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
10 seconds.

435
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

436
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let's have a shot.

437
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We're on it.

438
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Five.

439
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

440
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You like it.

441
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sending the globe via the internet.

And if you have a promo for your show, just send it to me.

458
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because that's what I'm trying to do.

459
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
By the way, people are waking up now.

460
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
They turn on the lights.

461
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Which means we're going to have breakfast and a little bit.

462
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So I'll have to clear off my table if I want to eat.

463
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And I got to tell you, I'm freaking starving.

464
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I had the shitiest meal, man.

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It was like the dinner.

466
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was just chicken, chicken, stuff.

467
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why don't they just make on air planes?

468
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Just make it simple.

469
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You know, make a grilled chicken or meat and potatoes.

470
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But you don't put all the saffron and it's all that crappy stuff in it.

471
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I do, I like culinary food.

472
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I just don't think that on air planes is the best place to try it.

473
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I went to tower records.

474
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
As I said earlier, before we got to the front left for the airport,

475
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
we're done and drew to pick up some good Charlotte stuff,

476
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
which is the band.

477
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
My daughter Christina is told he nuts about.

478
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And I think I told you in the last source code or before I left.

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think we need an energizer drink.

480
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
An energizer drink?

481
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's this?

482
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This is the energizer?

483
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's in it?

484
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Fruit?

485
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay, thank you.

486
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Excellent.

487
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I have an energizer, fruit drink.

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hmm.

489
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay, that totally makes up for the shitty dinner.

490
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That was really good.

491
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Anyway, so Christina has been in touch with the manager of this band

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
that is going on tour with Good Charlotte.

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And they're an unsigned band, non-R-I-A-A music.

494
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hmm.

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That really is good, this energy drink.

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I'm trying to find a place to put it down.

497
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't have enough hands right now.

498
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay, there we go.

499
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And so she sent me her favorite track,

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
MP3, which of course is totally clear to play, which I'm so happy about.

501
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So look for these guys on the road opening up for Good Charlotte.

502
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
As they come through the United Kingdom from the UK themselves.

503
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Here's three quarters.

504
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Check out Madeline.

505
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, it's the reason they're excited.

506
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah, it's the reason they're excited.

507
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, it's the reason they're excited.

508
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, it's the reason they're excited.

509
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah, it's the reason they're excited.

510
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And all our songs we care.

511
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Can sense them whenever then.

512
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Stop it.

513
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's silverware.

514
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You trying to listen to rained, it's nice sand.

515
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And we don't say it through it.

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,240
For we don't say that it's one way

517
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,040
Try to know whether it goes bad.

518
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,040
To break my heart

519
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,040
And tell the girl back to bed

520
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,040
To set me apart

521
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I promised that I'd never meet

522
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
The whole life broke no thanks to me

523
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,040
This isn't always out for one more time

524
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Here's your new baby

525
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Don't say things to the girl I know

526
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Something we're supposed to find inside

527
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,040
And we don't say another word

528
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Please don't say this moment

529
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Tell the girl back to bed

530
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,040
To break my heart

531
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,040
And tell the girl back to bed

532
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
To set me apart

533
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,040
To set me apart

534
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,040
To set me apart

535
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,040
To set me apart

536
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,040
To set me apart

537
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:26,040
To set me apart

538
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,040
To set me up

539
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,040
To set me apart

540
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,040
I told the girl back to bed

541
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,040
To set me apart

542
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Set me apart

543
00:22:51,040 --> 00:23:12,720
3 quarters.

544
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,860
Madeline and the be out on the road with good Charlotte check them out at 3-quarters.co.uk

545
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
and thanks for watching.

546
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:48,420
We're plug-in those guys here on the daily source code.

547
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:54,780
The post-collection on every side, everyone's sick of everyone else and they're all

548
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
turning snipe.

549
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,220
Set John Kerry as Bush's vote count was kicking back.

550
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,380
I can't believe I'm losing to this idiot.

551
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,180
Republicans have not been much more tactical though they won.

552
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,660
You turn on many Arnold Schwarzenegger almost came undone when he refused to hear Democrats

553
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,420
attacks from Puzzles, saying why listen to losers when my next office will be

554
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
oval.

555
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,340
Though she's gone to raise a Heinz is not forgotten.

556
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:29,500
Some say she's a hypocondriac, her opinion's not carry advisor sports just rotten.

557
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,620
They wish to migrate to stage to deadly or attack.

558
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:39,140
Even Dr. Rockin France has been rude to George W., he visited a era vet but if the U.S.

559
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,880
lights here he'll snab you.

560
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,300
George W. wanted was to reach out to the people of Europe.

561
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,860
He didn't mean to stir up.

562
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
Back to con syrup.

563
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Oh, hatreds when this time as electoral votes really were up.

564
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,900
Stay tuned for late breaking.

565
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,100
Oh, damn.

566
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Actually, yeah.

567
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,940
That's the snap.

568
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,620
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

569
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,420
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

570
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,300
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt the tap dance and podcast for news but I want to make

571
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,900
sure you caught that little bit of the wonderful service here on British Airways and

572
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,300
they're going to hook me up with my breakfast on the chair next to me for a few minutes.

573
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
I can't do that.

574
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
I can't do it.

575
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
I can't do it.

576
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
I can't do it.

577
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
I can't do it.

578
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Yes, lovely.

579
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Thank you.

580
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
I'm getting ready to English here.

581
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Tea.

582
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Lovely.

583
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
You can sugar.

584
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,300
So one thing at blogger calm that there were a lot of people were talking about was, well,

585
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,300
I was like, maybe just trying to sound here.

586
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Okay.

587
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Hold on.

588
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm trying to get my utensils at mean time.

589
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,300
See, I got a close mic, but otherwise you'll never hear me with all the airplane noise.

590
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Hold on.

591
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
It's not great.

592
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Still getting plastic knives and force.

593
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
It's just a good idea.

594
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Okay.

595
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Right, too.

596
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Nap can in place.

597
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Nice little muffins and nice little fruit here.

598
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Oh, it's looking so good.

599
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
Thank you very much.

600
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I have to say, by the way, that British Airways has this great service.

601
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,300
They have all different kinds of classes of service.

602
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,300
So there's economy class, but there's three different kinds.

603
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:30,300
And that all has to do with the size and of seats and space between your seat and the seat and front of you.

604
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Oh, I got to get my sort of crust on here.

605
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Hold on.

606
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,300
I hope I guess not.

607
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,300
And so in first class, I think I'd like condos up there.

608
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I don't know what's going on in first class.

609
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
But in that business class, they also have three classes of service.

610
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
And I took the lowest one.

611
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,300
And it's great because you're still going to sleep or seat and they actually slept for about five hours.

612
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,300
I'm not that comfortable, but even, and I'm a pretty tall guy.

613
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:04,300
I mean, I could totally stretch out and it was good because I feel reasonably refreshed.

614
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,300
So anyway, back to blogger con for a second.

615
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:17,300
The ground rules were very clear that vendors could not talk about their own products.

616
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Excuse me, does need a cup of tea.

617
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,300
And so there was some action in a couple of the sessions.

618
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
I wasn't in the overload session with Skobelware.

619
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,300
I guess the Kaka hit the fan.

620
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:35,300
But I thought that what the iPod or lemon guys did was the smartest thing they could have done.

621
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,300
By releasing iPod or 1.1, just before blogger con.

622
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't think any of the developers were there.

623
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:53,300
But they certainly had their announcement flowing through the iPod or, I guess, the iPod or podcast feed.

624
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,300
So if you missed it, I just want to play that for you because I love it with the way these guys do their marketing and promotion.

625
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,300
So it's upbeat and it's positive and it's cool.

626
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,300
The iPod or development team is happy to announce just in time for blogger con.

627
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,300
The availability of vision 1.1 of iPod or Windows and Macintosh.

628
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Grab it now from iPod.sourceforgedomnet.

629
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Yeah, it was there you go now.

630
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:26,300
I've been using it tested it out on the Macintosh and I got to say it's pretty cool.

631
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,300
They've got the directory in there and yeah.

632
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,300
It's amazing how far we've come and just a few short.

633
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,300
We will actually just a few months and how we have this software that is maturing.

634
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
It's beautiful.

635
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,300
And I'd like to remind you that Koma 1000 from Seattle as a podcast feed.

636
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,300
You can find it at the iPod or directory or if you go to audio.weblogs.com.

637
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
That's actually a great place to sample.

638
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:58,300
If you don't have an iPod or if you just want to see what is this podcasting all about or you want to see stuff that you may not be subscribed to.

639
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,300
But you might want to audio.weblogs.com.

640
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,300
That's the perfect place to go check out all things podcast.

641
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,300
And Koma 1000 is a radio station in Seattle and her voice bound is the consumer guy.

642
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,300
And I'd like to play his stuff once in a while because today I even learned something about cameras and megapixels.

643
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
How many megapixels do you want?

644
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
4 5 6.

645
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Go shopping for a digital camera and you'll need to answer that question.

646
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,300
The pixel count is a way to let you compare picture resolution from camera to camera.

647
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
The more megapixels the better.

648
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,300
The bottom line of megapixels is they matter but they're not everything.

649
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Paul Reynolds with consumer reports says a high pixel count matters most.

650
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,300
If you plan to make a lot of enlargements from the shots you take.

651
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:52,300
The more megapixels you have, the more flexibility you will have to edit your shots and say take a small part of that image and make it into a full print at an eight by ten or a large size.

652
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:58,300
But Reynolds says for a lot of people and entry level two or three megapixel camera is just fine.

653
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,300
If you're taking snapshots if you don't intend to do a lot of editing or cropping or make them into poster size,

654
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:11,300
a two or three megapixel camera will be fine for most people and of course it will be a lot less expensive than paying for more megapixels.

655
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:19,300
By the way, every Monday at this time from now through Christmas, we'll be looking at another digital product that just might be on your holiday shopping list.

656
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I'm her voice bomb, the consumer man.

657
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Looking out for you on Komo 1000.

658
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Thank you very much.

659
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Oh man, the timing is perfect.

660
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Keeps on showing up right away.

661
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
Something's over.

662
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
Thank you very much for her voice bomb.

663
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,300
For that info about cameras and what to do and what to get.

664
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:48,300
At the foot football dinner, I sat next to the author of podcasting from software land.

665
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
And I tell you,

666
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:56,300
blogger cameras blogger calm is really inspiring because people are going home and starting all kinds of new and cool projects.

667
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I got inspired to help people figure out how to do podcasting.

668
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,300
I've set up a new domain, www.howtopodcast.org.

669
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Not much there yet, but I'm planning on creating step-by-step instructions and links to various software downloads.

670
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
And hoping to get it up before Thanksgiving.

671
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,300
And finally, I got so jazzed by the energy I got from all the people of blogger calm.

672
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm inspired to do some other podcast besides software land.

673
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Once I get them set up, I'll tooth the horn for them.

674
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,300
The plan is to do a series of one to two-minute podcast and try to do that daily.

675
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,300
And then I'm also going to set up a music-only-related podcast featuring music that I've done,

676
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:43,300
as well as music that my daughter, Lindsey Taylor, who's much much better than me, has done.

677
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,300
And so, as I always say, that's it for now, from software land.

678
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Thank you very much.

679
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,300
And we're looking forward to howtopodcast.org.

680
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Which I think it was actually setting up for Mickey.

681
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,300
If you were at blogger calm, you know, there was one girl who stood up and said, you know,

682
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
I'm actually getting paid to blog.

683
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:11,300
She works for a movie company that makes movies about social issues and actually wants people to participate

684
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,300
in the conversation about the topic of the movies.

685
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,300
And I think what was interesting is when she stood up and was, you know, someone said, oh, and he's Mickey,

686
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,300
and she actually gets paid.

687
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Or she, I think she introduced herself a thing I get paid.

688
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,300
When she stood up, I could hear 15 guys in the room in their head go.

689
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Pointing around around around around.

690
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,300
She's the most beautiful Picasso tattoo on her arm.

691
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,300
And she was sitting right next to him.

692
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,300
When he was, so this, that's the thing that's how the whole howtopodcast.org came up

693
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
because Mickey really wants to learn how to podcast.

694
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,300
And, well, you know, there's so many gallon guys that I'll always jump in and want to help her with that.

695
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,300
A lot of people commented on mojones.

696
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
I've played mojones a lot on the show.

697
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
And people have said that they really wanted to buy the album.

698
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Couldn't get a hold of it, which sucks.

699
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,300
So I fired off a mail to the guys and I said, look guys, you got to figure out how we can sell your CD,

700
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,300
where people from the states can get a hold of it.

701
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,300
And I asked them, and this is based upon Steve Gilmore's,

702
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,300
not even recommendation, but almost his demand.

703
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,300
He wants a live unplugged mojones mini concert from the castle.

704
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Before we leave, check it out.

705
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,300
So I sent in the request and I said, guys, come on.

706
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Let's do some cool.

707
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Let's mic it up.

708
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Let's do a little mini concert.

709
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,300
And we'll put it out there for everybody to enjoy.

710
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,300
And of course, they should also figure out how to sell their CD at the same time.

711
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Because I think that people would love to have some live material and also get their CD,

712
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
which is good stuff.

713
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,300
And on openpodcast.org, number 127, I came across a different mojones.

714
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,300
The mojones that I know is mojnons.nl actually.

715
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:06,300
And this is M-O-E, space J-O-N-E-S mojones and a cup of Joe.

716
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:38,300
I'm only cup but Joe.

717
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,300
I crave a plane of table and a door of junk.

718
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
Don't put anything on.

719
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm talking junk of George.

720
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
I sit for mug of dust.

721
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
With the cream and a spoon.

722
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
How many orders that we need.

723
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Give me a pile of sky.

724
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
We top a pair of stands.

725
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Throw in a handful of things.

726
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Bad and do everything.

727
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
To the crap on matter.

728
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
On a tray you'll break.

729
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I'll make the spoon of short.

730
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Do I need to go on?

731
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I want to get but Joe.

732
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Yeah.

733
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Don't add that done.

734
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:37,300
I'll pour a glass of chairs.

735
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Do a tub of Bob.

736
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
I'll smoke a pack of Jack.

737
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
While I'm burning my back.

738
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
I'll eat and drink.

739
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
I'll eat and drink.

740
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
I'll pour glass of chairs.

741
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Do a tub of Bob.

742
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
I'll smoke a pack of Jack.

743
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
While I'm burning my back.

744
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
I'll eat and dish a crisp.

745
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Another bowl of Joe.

746
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
All on a saucer a team.

747
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Would you rather have him?

748
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,300
Just feel me up with.

749
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,300
Fred, feed me your fork of Frank.

750
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,300
And while more healthy a team.

751
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
May it all rise and take him.

752
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Oh, man again.

753
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
Damn it make a meal of Sam.

754
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
But don't give me no more.

755
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Because what I really want to come for, Joe.

756
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Don't add that done.

757
00:36:50,300 --> 00:37:02,300
I want a cup of Joe.

758
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
I'll grab a plate of Dave.

759
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
Open a jar of John.

760
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Don't put anything on.

761
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
I'll charge a jug of George.

762
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
I'll sit for my cup done.

763
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
With the creamer of steam.

764
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
How many more does that leave?

765
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
You beat a bottle of sky.

766
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Heat up a panel stand.

767
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Throw in a handful of things.

768
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
And you every train.

769
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Or in a can of Dan.

770
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
Make a meal of Sam.

771
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
But don't give me no more.

772
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,300
Because what I really want to come for, Joe.

773
00:37:46,300 --> 00:38:14,300
I'll play it all, Dave.

774
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:24,300
We were off steam.

775
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,300
A cup of Joe.

776
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
And what was that?

777
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
A handful of Dick.

778
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Interesting lyrics there.

779
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Well, that's just going to wrap it up for today's Mile High Edition of the Daily Source

780
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
It's still talking in undertones.

781
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,300
People don't look at me like saying, shut up.

782
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,300
You want peace and quiet on the plate.

783
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:56,300
When I get back, it's going to be a second noise.

784
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,300
Guys coming back again.

785
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,300
When I get back, I probably won't be in until 10 o'clock.

786
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,300
I want to get home in the castle until 10.

787
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,300
And that means that Wednesday, as of Wednesday, I have almost exactly one week.

788
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
To get everything ready for the big move.

789
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,300
So that means that I got to spend one of these days back and up the bar.

790
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,300
I'm packing up all of my stuff because that's like the only thing left that hasn't been packed up yet.

791
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:30,300
So I will of course be bringing you a source code every single day as we try to do.

792
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,300
And when I get back, I'll have more thoughts to stuff about podcasting.

793
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,300
What we learned at BloggerCon and where we're going.

794
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,300
And of course, always ready to promote any new stuff that comes out.

795
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,300
So thank you all very much for checking it out.

796
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,300
The source code for November 9th, 2004.

797
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:57,300
And as always, if you want to leave a comment, add a MacLeod.com.

798
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
Audio comments are welcome.

799
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,300
You might want to just send me your L to the MP3 instead of the whole MP3 file.

800
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,300
And of course, you can leave a comment on my weblog live.cure.com.

801
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,300
And you can find a new source code.

802
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,300
No, the archives at dailysourcecode.com and the podcast fee.

803
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,300
A source code.com slash rss.xml.

804
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
All right, everybody.

805
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
We'll be landing in about an hour.

806
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,300
And tomorrow I'll bring you another daily source code from TheCaston.

807
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Take care.

808
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Bye.

809
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
We'll be back.

810
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
We'll be back.

811
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
We'll be back.

812
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,300
The hour is up to zero.
