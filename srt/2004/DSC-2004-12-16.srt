00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,240
Welcome to the Data Source Code, today is Thursday, December 6, 2004, coming to you from

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,280
Curry Cottage in the United Kingdom, and the lovely, affluent, seri, town of Guilfe,

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:36,320
hits the source code, I'm Adam Curry and I've got the sniffles, I don't know if this is man,

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,400
it was like, I thought I was done this season with flu and stuff and it's nothing else bothers me,

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,120
it's all it is, it's 100% snob. It's not like a painting pretty picture there for you.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,960
Once again, it's about 40 minutes, users and developers partying together, got some nerdy stuff

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,480
to talk about today, some pot-safe music, in fact, one of my favorite bands, Mo Jones

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,000
is going to play something like them later on, and also have a bit of cover villa I want to share with you.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Pretty unabendful day, actually, went off to the Starbucks to the band with

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,680
whole to the pipe, had to go suck on the pipe for a while, got that nice and early, I was there

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,520
around one o'clock, usually I'm a little bit later than that, I had my regular Grande Capuchino,

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:41,200
why is it the instead of saying regular large or small at Starbucks, what is it tall, that's

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,760
their small, Grande is their media more, actually kind of looks large, and then humanoid,

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:58,160
like the big golf size, is venti. God knows, makes no sense, but I noticed that I'm starting to

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,200
catch up with a lot of stuff, not with email, of course, I'm planning on catching up on that

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,160
starting Monday, I'll talk about that in a sec, but had some, yeah, really kind of got a little bit

17
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,080
synced up with the podcasts and was able to actually, I think it's because I was playing with the

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,160
I River, you know, that I think I downloaded more than my usual quote, just filling it up,

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
and I was listening to a lot of that today, and came across some excellent stuff, lot of fun.

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,240
See, what else did I do, really? Oh, yeah, of course, God did the network test, put the source

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,640
code up on the old server, which as many of you, not noticed is a dot max server, it's just my regular

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,040
Adam Curry homepage dot mac, where dot mac account, where actually I had the source code, I was running it there

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,840
for a long time, and then we switched over to a new band with the new servers, and it was working fine

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
up until I guess we hit some critical point, and thank you all very much for all the testing you've done,

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
about what at last count there was about 90, 90 different comments of people who've been checking

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,640
out doing AV testing today on the dot mac account versus the Adam.opmail.org URL, where you could find

27
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,160
today's show, yes today's show, I'm sorry, and it was just great to see all the tests going on,

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,360
and it looks like, I guess with the provider that we have, once you hit some critical mass of band with,

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,400
instead of throttling, well, maybe that is the only way you can throttle overload of circuits

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
is to just start refusing packets, and that's pretty much what people are seeing happen is

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,880
packets being refused. Now there's a couple of different options that we can take. One thing I've asked

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,480
I potter developers and I've already seen some requests going and feature requests, so I'm hoping

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,200
that they will have time to put this in, not just for the case that I bumped up against, but

34
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,920
anything can happen, shit just does happen, if you're sitting on a 30 or 40 minute download, and

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,920
the connection breaks or something hoses for some reason, it's a shame if you can't get the show

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,800
anymore because somewhere, there is a certain amount of Murphy in the network, so some kind of

37
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:21,040
recheck, and I think perhaps most, I don't know if the iPodders actually will look to complete

38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,800
all of the bytes, well, what will be nice that they would start the download again, and even

39
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,760
better if they could start it, you know, resume where they left off. That's one fix. Of course,

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:42,240
another one is staggering the RSS files, so you can basically change it. I think does that make sense?

41
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,760
What I'm saying now, yeah, so you release the RSS file with the feed pointing to one location,

42
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,240
and then 15 minutes later you change it to another location, basically load balancing it out.

43
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,280
BitTorrent, of course, seems like something we should be looking at pretty soon, and I think that we're

44
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,840
going to see that, well, there's already been a lot of development going on, and I believe most of the

45
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,840
major iPodders clients support BitTorrent. Actually, do we know if every single one of them supports

46
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,280
BitTorrent yet, is that a given, we should check that, because if they do, then, wow, what are we waiting

47
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,960
for, right? Let's get moving. So I'm going to keep it with the dot Mac for now, but clearly

48
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,880
on the lookout for some really good bandwidth, and the one thing I'd love to hear from, and the

49
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,760
one or two people seem to have a lot of knowledge about networks. If you're really in the networking

50
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,120
business, please shoot me an email or an audio comment or whatever, just so we understand what we need

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,040
to get, where we need to be, and even what is it going to cost? Where do I have to be to have

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,280
not have a problem with number of subscribers trying to get to my content? And is there someone

53
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,920
in this universe who can benefit from that? Oh, joy. Hello to the Prince of Paul at the

54
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,320
boy. I don't know. Written hour from Portland, Oregon. I was sitting on the train on the way home

55
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,080
from work, listening to the source code, and I was fucking shocked. I couldn't believe what I was

56
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,280
hearing about your I-river, because I have an I-river, the hard drive-based one, the Ford

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,840
gang, the I-HP 140, and it's totally different. It does all the things that you said it, you wanted

58
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,960
it to do a record straight to MP3, which is why what I'm doing right now, using the internal

59
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,720
mic, I just can't believe that they did a such a good job of mine and my product and just such

60
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,960
a horrible job on the other. I mean, you got to record straight to MP3, or at least to a wave,

61
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,760
and you got to just boot up just like a drive. That's what mine does. I can't believe they didn't

62
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,760
do that right. That really makes me mad, and I'm sorry, that you got screwed on that.

63
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,720
Anyway, because I think that my product for my rivers really good, so anyway, take that for what

64
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,320
it is. One satisfying question or two is some satisfying customer. So, keep it up, man,

65
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,040
love on the source code. All right, dude. Gotta love the Prince of Paul. Sorry. I haven't written

66
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,120
out of there. Okay, so clearly there's a difference in different models of I rivers, and I got quite

67
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,520
a lot of email and comments about the discussion that we had where I kind of reviewed this,

68
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,840
what is it? The IFP 799? I have to keep looking at that, let me see. Yeah, IFP 799. We have this

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:36,720
crappy I-river media manager. It's not even a media manager. It's a music manager. Imagine that.

70
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
Oh, whoever thought we'd want to manage anything else with music on our I-river MP3 players.

71
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,760
And there's all this DRM stuff in it, and the worst part is just that you can't just stick it

72
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,800
into your USB port and have it mount as a drive, which is clearly what Adams and written hours

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,880
I-river is doing. I guess he has a maybe more expensive model. I think he has one of the square ones.

74
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,440
This is basically like a little triangle of cheese. And what I mean, if you buy like a cheese stick,

75
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:21,520
I-I-river doesn't smell like a cheese stick. So it doesn't mount. And I got an email, and of

76
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,040
course all of this, as usual, in the production show notes, from, uh, this is from, uh, it was from Holland.

77
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:37,440
I remember, uh, Julius, right? Julius says he's got the I-HP 140, which doesn't have any of the

78
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,480
the same problems, but he says that there's some places to look on the net that you can basically

79
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,920
hack the firmware, one of them is MysticRiver.net, and there are ways to get around whatever

80
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,160
he calls the DRM shit in there. Um, clearly, you know, it's like, boy, we really got to figure this out

81
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,920
because otherwise it's a pretty nice machine. In the interface, it can still use work, but sound quality

82
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,600
is amazing. The sound and the options that you can set is quite good. And again, uh, for reporter

83
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,360
purposes, or for, um, on the go podcast purposes to have it, you know, just handy and be able to

84
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,720
record something at good quality, even with the built-in mic for, you know, 30, 40 hours on end,

85
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,880
it's, it's an invaluable tool without a doubt. Over the weekend, I was, uh, checking out, uh, no,

86
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,360
no, over the weekend, this was Tuesday, I think, Monday, or, no, it was Tuesday. Was it, yeah,

87
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,800
Tuesday, I was listening to coverville. Uh, I love, uh, the cover real podcast. Um, and, and I'm,

88
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,000
to this day, not sure about the legality of playing cover songs, but, um, you know, cover realist

89
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,960
playing asscaping BMI fees and has an arrangement. I hope all that's cool. I really do it because

90
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,120
it's so incredible to hear, uh, most of the songs you recognize, uh, but to hear them in different

91
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,560
versions, uh, sometimes original, sometimes covers. It's, uh, it's just, it's a fabulous show and the

92
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,160
frequency of this show. I think it's, uh, three times a week, um, you know, that's, it's great. I love

93
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. And even though it's a pretty big download, uh, the extra

94
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,520
quality, it's 128, uh, K is, uh, it's, uh, it's well worth it. Now, of course, I wouldn't want to break

95
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:27,520
any RIA rules or regulations or want to screw anybody, but, um, I heard this track. It's a cover from

96
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:35,920
1990, uh, a song done by, uh, was not was. I know, uh, Don and David, I've met them several times,

97
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,960
interviewed him a couple of times. So I'm sure they wouldn't have a problem with it. Don

98
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,920
about the record company. Um, and, and, and this song that they're doing is, uh, special to me,

99
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,280
because they mentioned a date in there, which is my birthday. So, uh, automatically, even though

100
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,200
it's in a completely different context in the song, it's the song that is, you know, the lyrics

101
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,920
of stuck with me for all of my life, basically. Um, so I want to play it for you because it is

102
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:08,000
such a kick-ass version. It is so incredibly good that I think in, you know, we could just, it's

103
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,560
news. And this is fair use. It's news. Cover of gold played an incredibly un-real version.

104
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,040
Well, I, you know, I can't even announce it. I'll just have to have the, you know, the, I played the whole

105
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,720
cover, cover real bit for you, so you can. All right, moving on. Let's, uh, we got a great big show

106
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,400
for you tonight. Yeah, everybody. So let's get down to it. Our first group is, uh, was not was,

107
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,120
a bunch of folks from Detroit, uh, let by, I'm going to turn it up to 11 here, hold on.

108
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,080
Not their real names, not brothers, their David Weiss, and Don Fagensen, they went by the

109
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,280
alias's Don Fagensen, or David and Don was, put your earphones on, had a ton of different

110
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,920
vocalists in the band. It's really good. There cover of Poppa was a Rolling Stone, crank it up from

111
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:08,240
1990. Here on cover of it. Oh, oh. I'll shut up. But I bet you, you can't stop pressing down that

112
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
accelerator, baby.

113
00:12:38,240 --> 00:13:08,240
That's what we would have to write on them. Yeah, I'm very mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

114
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:38,240
The day I always remember, yes I belong and all But I moved the day, I need to time, I never had a chance to see him, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah,

115
00:13:38,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I

116
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:38,240
'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, and I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish, but I'm a fish,

117
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,760
One, two, one, but now I'm ready

118
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
And I don't dwell a self-pity

119
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,520
Taking a bottle of life you didn't give me

120
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,440
I remember when I used to tell lies

121
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
When people would ask I'd get fat aside

122
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,440
Taking a story used to make you look good

123
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,840
But the little true one, you was never knowing it

124
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,760
We were used to say, I look just like you

125
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,840
The best to show I don't act like you

126
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm more than that, I'm on my way as quick

127
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
Better, and you can best believe

128
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm much more together

129
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,560
So believe it

130
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
But then I'm up

131
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
And isn't true what they said

132
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
I've never been working days

133
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
In my life

134
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
And my mother

135
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
And I'm going round time

136
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Said Papa had the opposite

137
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
And I love the way

138
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
And that ain't right

139
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
I've been talking about Papa

140
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
But I'm so stupid, freaky

141
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
And I'm not ashamed

142
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
All the time

143
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Doing and done

144
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
It's still in the name of the Lord

145
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
We'll be right over here

146
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
So it's still in the name of the Lord

147
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
And I love the way

148
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
And that ain't right

149
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
But I'm going round time

150
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Said Papa had the opposite

151
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
And I love the way

152
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
And that ain't right

153
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
And that ain't right

154
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I'm a techman

155
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
And I'm always the Lord

156
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm always the one

157
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
And that ain't right

158
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
So believe it

159
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm really down

160
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Oh, he's the first one

161
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Oh, yeah

162
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Think it's been said

163
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
You gave me something you never had

164
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
But that's not always true

165
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
And it's sad

166
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
If I'm myself missing you when I did

167
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
But who knows the reasons you did when you did

168
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
I can't help but to wonder why

169
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
If every life has a big fat lie

170
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
You act like you're having no responsibilities

171
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Because if you did, it's a bet that you wouldn't be

172
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Still if you're back in hustling and screaming

173
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
You've been a gotta job, but did you know what I mean

174
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
And I'm put, I'm talking about it on his day's day

175
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
But used to lazy for the pre that way

176
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Oh, he's trying to take the easy ride

177
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
That's what they tell me, so I don't know it's out

178
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
And for a moment, not for a sec

179
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Because your lack of self respect

180
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
But it's too late, but you that is

181
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Tomorrow I'll be doing all about my business

182
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
And so it's time to put the past behind

183
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
You race to anger

184
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
And clear my mind

185
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I wanna forget the little bit I know

186
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
And make sure that I never see someone

187
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Because I love my kids to go up and know

188
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
And I was always there because I love the soul

189
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
And that's the least thing that I can do

190
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
But that's a lot more than I can't for you

191
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Oh, I'm put, I'm put, I'm talking about it on his day's

192
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
So it's time to put, I'm talking about it on his day's day

193
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,160
But you say, I'm put, I'm put, I'm put, I'm put, I'm put

194
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Still if you're back in hustling and screaming

195
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,160
He's beat, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

196
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
But I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

197
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Wow, oh, oh, oh, That's all i do

198
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
deter the truth

199
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Of that feeling

200
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Oh

201
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,

202
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

203
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. Oh, I see

204
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

205
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:35,400
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

206
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:44,600
ask or what, whoo, I was, man, I was awesome. I just love that version. Oh, that is so cool.

207
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,400
And isn't really a shame how shitty MP3 really sounds when it gets down to it.

208
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,360
Because I've heard better versions, just even though it's a grading coding from cover

209
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,480
ville, it does degrade. It really does degrade after a while. And I'm degrading it with my own

210
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,080
recompression of recompression. So one day, you know, one day will have real high quality

211
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,280
audio or, you know, maybe you'll pay a little bit extra for super duper high quality audio.

212
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,360
You'll have to one way the other for your hard disk space. So it's, it's, it's, but

213
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,520
oh, geez, I love that. Love that. More cool tunes on the way. And, um, uh, when I wanted to mention

214
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,680
that, uh, oh, yeah, uh, the Dutch podcasting scene is finally happening. And I was trying to figure out,

215
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,560
why was it taking so long? Because, you know, I'd post on my dad. I mean, people know who I am

216
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,160
and Holland had posted my Dutch weblog several times. You know, hey, come on over and check out

217
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,320
what's happening on the, uh, on the English side on the curried alive.curried.com. And of course,

218
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,040
I realize now that there have been so many tragic accidents that have, or accidents or deaths

219
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,800
really that have taken place in Holland in the past six months, um, you know, you take a

220
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:06,840
tale of a hook into a count. And Andre Hazes, uh, who is a real folk hero singer, um, Prince

221
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,680
Bernard, uh, they finally buried him, uh, just, uh, just the other day. And he died, uh, um, was it

222
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,240
last weekend, I think? Uh, uh, I mentioned a tale of a hook ride. Of course, uh, pin for town,

223
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,360
three years ago. By now, which is it's, it's been, uh, it's been kind of weird. And I think that now

224
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,800
finally the press is, you know, they've covered all the deaths and the, and the Prince actually did one final

225
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,320
interview a few days before he died. Uh, I haven't actually read the whole thing myself, but apparently

226
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,240
it really took, uh, took the Mickey out of a couple people to put it politely. Uh, so I think that

227
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,880
they, they were done, you know, they had nothing left to cover and, uh, you know, start looking around

228
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,160
and say, hey, what's this commotion gone over there? Oh, that's, that's the podcasters. I'm sorry,

229
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,040
what are these podcasters you speak of? So I think that's, uh, that's what happened. So, uh,

230
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,560
B&N, uh, which is a broadcast company that I worked for for about, uh, was it, uh, over a year?

231
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,920
It was over a year, a little under a year. I did a Friday radio show for them. I love the show,

232
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,360
love doing that show. It was, um, seven to ten did it with the Kid V, uh, you don't

233
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,320
care, I can defect them. And, um, uh, I got admit that we didn't really leave on the best of terms,

234
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:30,920
because I kind of like just like quit. Which, uh, is pretty much, uh, uh, yeah, it wasn't a nice way

235
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,160
to end the relationship in hindsight, but there was a whole bunch of things going on and, you know,

236
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:42,040
it's just, it happened that way. Um, and it's not that I went anywhere else, really, per se. I just,

237
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,200
I just didn't want to do it for a number of reasons. Mainly, uh, there was a big to do about, um,

238
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:59,320
the outrageous salaries that people in the public broadcasting sector were, uh, enjoying for relatively

239
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,880
little work. And I was one of them, basically. And, and this whole report came out, this 110 page.

240
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,560
I think it was a McKinsey or Anderson, Anderson report. And I read it and I was just disgusted.

241
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,760
And I have to quit. I can't do this because this is partially about me. Uh, and I just felt

242
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,360
it was totally wrong because it was public money, you know, and it could have been put to much better

243
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,120
use. And basically it was subsidizing my helicopter lessons at the time. So, so anyway, regardless,

244
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,800
uh, I had a real good time, um, uh, working with them then, I tried to, you know, sell them on the idea

245
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,240
of web logs. And I actually had a lot of infrastructure set up for them, which they, you know,

246
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,800
then they went off and did it themselves, right? Typical story. Um, if you've ever seen blog news

247
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,840
network, you know, that, you know, I basically set that up, you know, willing to sell it to them,

248
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,640
or to, you know, to get them running on it and, uh, they had their own ideas. It's an old story,

249
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,480
but, you know, it's like, they're, I don't know, maybe they're a little corporate,

250
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:03,560
little government, you know, something typical about that. And, uh, uh, so now they've started podcasting,

251
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,080
which is really nice because I know that, you know, basically everyone there's young and smart

252
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,400
energetic and they do a number of, uh, really high quality radio shows, um, uh, and it did really

253
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,080
different formats, a lot of talk and talk and music formats. And so they've, uh, created podcast feeds,

254
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,120
and that's now become pretty much a big news story in Holland, right on the heels of the Heineken

255
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,120
podcast. Uh, so, uh, and I think this is a, a much bigger story, by the way, because it is essentially

256
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,120
what they're doing is they're pointing to the BBC and saying, hey, look, you know, the BBC are doing

257
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,480
a podcast, well, the BBC did like a podcast in a half. Um, and, uh, and, you know, and so the news is,

258
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,320
look, this is a great way to spend, um, the public's money, we're basically, uh, letting you enjoy

259
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,080
our programming, um, any, any time you want, if, uh, you know, if you don't choose to listen to it on the radio.

260
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:00,520
So, uh, that's, that's cool. And, uh, hopefully they're going to get listed in the iPodor.org

261
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,800
directory in the radio, no, they, they sent me an email and said, you know, can you put it

262
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,360
in the directory? So, well, you need to go into radio, I guess, or, I mean, where would you want to be?

263
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,840
And, uh, they just have to use the suggest to link feature. That's, uh, the beauty of the, uh, the

264
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,400
openness of the directory. But I'm sure that'll work out and they should show up. And, uh,

265
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:25,400
welcome to have them here in our podcast space. Hi, this is Craig Patchett from godcast.org

266
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:33,480
with the Living Word for Wednesday, December 15th, 2004. Our verses for today are Matthew 6,

267
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:42,280
19 through 21, and the translation is the NASP. This is Jesus, speaking as part of his sermon on the

268
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:51,160
Mount. Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where Moth and Rust destroy and where thieves

269
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:58,280
break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither Moth nor Rust

270
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:06,680
destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal. For where your treasure is, dare your heart will be

271
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:18,920
also Matthew 6, 19 through 21. Okay, and that's beautiful. So, um, I subscribe to the, uh, to godcast.org

272
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,240
to the Living Word because this is what comes through. And, um, and this is actually, of course,

273
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,240
you know, I think the heaven here is a metaphor, right? This is, uh, it's about what's in your head,

274
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,160
basically heaven head. So, uh, basically this is not, this is, I think what this is saying here is,

275
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,240
um, you know, all the worldly possessions really don't mean anything. It's, uh, it's the possessions

276
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,680
that you collect along the journey of life and that you, uh, carry with you and that you cherish.

277
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:56,680
And I can tell you, um, from someone who was amassed an amazing amount of stuff. I mean, really

278
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,800
stuff, and I've seen it because I've given half of it away in the past, in the past four weeks,

279
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,760
just given away our stuff because it's sickening. Um, it really, it's, uh, it's nothing compared

280
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,000
to the experiences that you keep up in your head, and in your heart, which in this case, I think is,

281
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,960
in this verse of Matthew is, uh, uh, what's being talked about, uh, what's being referred to as heaven.

282
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,960
And what thieves do not break in or steal? That's cool. Yeah, because thieves, where are your treasure

283
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:33,480
or your heart? There, your heart will be also. Matthew 6, 19 through 21. Don't you feel refreshed?

284
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,440
Now, now that we've been posting to the living word, comments and verse requests are always welcome

285
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,440
and we'd back at godcast.org. This is Craig Patchett. Hoping that God blesses your day today.

286
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:52,120
I'll see you tomorrow. God bless your day as well, brother. Excellent. Godcast.org.

287
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,920
Hey, got an audio comment from Lee Wilkins, an update on Alfian Benson.

288
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,480
Hey, Adam, it's Lee Wilkins. I was just listening to you going on about, um, and half the

289
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,800
listening to Robert talking about the paper and the phase involved. Well, as you know, that's right.

290
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,840
We were talking about that yesterday, um, uh, uh, what PayPal charges, because we did, uh,

291
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,840
we raised the money for Alfian Benson, um, uh, VIA, uh, a PayPal donation link.

292
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,880
It managed to raise the funds to get Alfian Benson back. You! Hey, boy. Now, they're going to be

293
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,320
back Friday morning instead of Thursday morning because the quarantine people can't pick them up,

294
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,160
but at least they're coming back. That's the main thing. But going back to the question anyway,

295
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:40,440
uh, or a solution. Whatever, um, is that PayPal, we transferred the money to a guy in Houston,

296
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,160
who was going to pay us cash over the count. Wait a minute. That sounded really dodgy.

297
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,360
Wait a minute, you paid it to a guy in Houston who was going to pay it cash and bring it in a

298
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:55,720
brown paper bag with the hellest. What's going on here, Lee? Uh, in the US, um, and we transferred

299
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:04,840
to 1,200 and something dollars, okay? But what I'm trying to get to PayPal and PayPal took their

300
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:15,000
fee. They took a fee of $43 dollars, um, for, for the 1,200 something. We said them, which I don't

301
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,720
think is, I personally don't think it's too bad considering the urgency in the matter. But I can

302
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,920
understand where Robert's coming from, where you're coming from, but you know, PayPal do take a large

303
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:34,680
chunk. Right. But here's, here's the question. How much did PayPal take? Um, when we sent it

304
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,600
to you, is that also a piece that they, so PayPal was basically grabbing it twice in this case.

305
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,640
But, okay. I mean, yeah, I kind of agree with your point. And so it's, uh, what does that? It's like,

306
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
three and a half percent or something. It's at the service trip, about three percent.

307
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:56,680
You know, the other day, PayPal, our business and these banks. Um, I'm so I got in

308
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,360
the introduction there. We, we don't call that a businessly. Hold on. We just, we call that a

309
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:09,720
business business. And these banks, um, online payment companies have got to make this money

310
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,640
somewhere. So one of screw over us consumers. Yeah. And that's it. As I said, Alfie invented

311
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,760
a back tomorrow Friday, the 17th of December. Um, touchdown and morning, we're going to visit

312
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,040
a meeting afternoon. I'll upload a podcast and some pictures and all that over the weekend as

313
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,720
well. So have fun. Take care, Adam. Bye bye. Yeah, excellently. Okay. Well, looking forward to pictures

314
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,920
and, uh, and sounds of Alfie and Benson, uh, happily barking away. Have anyone else noticed by

315
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,360
the way, uh, that if you've gotten into podcasting, and I mean, really just listen to podcasts,

316
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,600
that you may not necessarily be watching as much TV as you use to, as you use to, and I'm really

317
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,720
finding this. And it actually may be not even that I'm, um, that I'm watching less, but I find that

318
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,880
less interesting. This is so little television that is compelling to me. I mean, news is no longer

319
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:08,360
compelling because I get my news on the internet. Um, some, well, BBC news, I, I like to watch because

320
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,680
it has some regional stuff that I'm still not tuned into, and I'm trying to figure out who's

321
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:18,280
what and who's doing what, uh, but still I, I think I get most of my news, uh, online. And then

322
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,760
reality shows, at this point, they're not really reality shows anymore. They're, you know,

323
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:30,280
very preconceived type of reality shows. Um, I don't know. I just, uh, podcasts seem so much more

324
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,920
exciting to me. I actually look forward to, I guess that is kind of like weblogs used to be when we

325
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,400
had weblogs.com just in the beginning, uh, you sit there and you hit refresh, you know, I was like,

326
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,000
oh, you know, what's it? When, oh, look, this guy just posted, oh, she just posted, you know,

327
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,720
here's that weblog that I've been following. And the same thing now with audio.weblogs.com,

328
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,200
it's great. And if, if you don't know how that works, uh, definitely go to iPod.org and there's a link

329
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,120
on the, uh, the couple of links to get help on that. Because you want, if you have a new podcast,

330
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,440
you want to be pinging that server as what we call it, which means you basically say, hello,

331
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,320
I have a podcast that's updated here. I am, and, uh, you'll show up on the top of that list and

332
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,080
believe me, a lot of people look at that list. And also, that information is available in XML format.

333
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,240
So that's being pulled into, um, uh, into new applications so that when people open up their iPod or,

334
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,840
uh, and eventually, uh, this will all be on your MP3 player. I hope you'll see on your MP3 player that,

335
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,440
uh, that something new is, uh, is available. Um, and you can make decisions about that, uh, on the go.

336
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:38,120
So, uh, uh, I think radio's getting back for that, uh, that video killed the radio star thing.

337
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:44,040
Oh, yeah, it's a show called audio. This episode won a body with a camera on the last one.

338
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,040
Let me answer your monies. Let me begin and just start proposing to you this idea that I've got of an MP3

339
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,920
key ask. So if you're like me, you've spent countless hours and airports, hotels and on highways,

340
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,160
with nothing good to listen to. So, uh, everybody who's like that raise your hand.

341
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,800
Okay. You know, you, you, you gas up at a truck stop at travel America or a loves. And what do you

342
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:11,320
find inside, but, uh, I use condom. It'll be more on audio cassette, which I would never buy,

343
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,840
or you're in an airport terminal. And what do you find for sale there? But uh, you too, it's all

344
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,600
you too with the airport. $30 audio books. And you can't listen to the narrator ahead of time. So,

345
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,800
you know, if you don't like the way the voice sounds, you're screwed. You know, I'm sure a few

346
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,280
years will all be downloading audio content onto our cell phones, Dave Winner and Adam Curry,

347
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,840
or forming a company as we speak on this premise of micro stations. I think it's a terrific idea

348
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,720
and I'd love to hear more details. But until we have universal adoption of their service, which

349
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,880
sure is going to take at least a couple of years, there's a market for another idea, I think,

350
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,760
and it's the end of it. Wait a minute, let me just stop there because I had you, I was completely

351
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:55,560
there for a second. I totally love the idea of at an airport where there's like a Wi-Fi and, um,

352
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:02,200
and in your iPod, your MP3 player, your iRiver, your creative labs. Go, it's bling, you know,

353
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,320
and then maybe there's a transaction, you pay for something, but, you know, it comes, it's comes

354
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,840
boiling in and along with anything else you happen to be subscribed to, it's like a filling station.

355
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,280
I can, yeah, why not have every gas station via an iPod filling station? MP3 Kiosk. So, with

356
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,920
the wireless broadband connection and a touch screen, the public can easily pull audio content onto

357
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,920
a portable device, right? Or burn it right there onto a CD-ROM. The back end is just an iPod or a

358
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,520
Doppler derivative and the gooey's got an autopsy. I'm going to go to gooey with me, please.

359
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,600
Oh, that anybody, even your grandmother understands it. No, I bullshit. So, you can sort the content

360
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,120
by genre and popularity and, you know, if you wanted to try, listen to it. Okay, totally. I love it.

361
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,960
I love the idea. It's a great idea. I mean, just the fact that we can have point to point sales, you know,

362
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,760
of, you walk in and, and you can fill up really cool. And that, of course, is only a step,

363
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,320
you know, from, from when, entire cities are blanketed and Wi-Fi. So, a lot of interesting stuff

364
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:21,000
coming up in the future people. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to me, I'll come.

365
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,080
Merry Christmas. I just wanted to let you know, the scalp.net will be featuring nothing,

366
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,880
but Christmas music for the rest of December. From the obscure?

367
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,320
To the classics?

368
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
To some stuff you've never heard before.

369
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,160
So, tune in to the scalp.net Christmas kit.

370
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,800
All right, talking about being a total TV junkie, reminded me that it was time to pull some

371
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:19,480
loads of jones out of iTunes. Roll it out for you. These are a couple of brothers, cats, who, you know,

372
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,560
home-seedy up in the rannick on their mat.

373
00:35:49,480 --> 00:36:04,280
I'm sorry. That really sucked. That's just no good. We're going to have to do that again, I'm sorry.

374
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,880
I just can't live that way. I have to do mojones just as, you know, we got to kick it off again.

375
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,160
TV junkie, mojones on your daily summer scroll.

376
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm sorry for the radio drop. We're not happening again.

377
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:52,440
Call me Mr. Scream. I can't tell you now. What you long child free?

378
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,680
I can't take it no more. But some fact keeps me dead.

379
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,080
I'm alone.

380
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:13,880
I'll free to turn it off again. Maybe you won't come to an answer.

381
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:31,800
Go out here, mojones, mojones on your daily junkie, mojones on your daily junkie, mojones on your daily junkie.

382
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,720
No, my computer is not broken.

383
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,560
Splinter, give me something else.

384
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,520
Faint up my ground.

385
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,240
Wait, this might have been sped. I can't take it no more.

386
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,360
No, no. But some fact keeps me dead.

387
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm alone.

388
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,400
I'll free to turn it off again. Maybe you won't come to an answer.

389
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:26,680
Go out here, mojones, mojones on your daily junkie, mojones on your daily junkie, mojones on your daily junkie, mojones on your daily junkie, mojones on your daily junkie.

390
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,680
Splinter, give me something else.

391
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,480
Splinter, give me something else.

392
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,760
Splinter, give me something else.

393
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,000
Splinter, give me something else.

394
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,160
T-D-A-V.

395
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,080
Junkey, and I'll do it for the Thursday edition of your daily source code.

396
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:10,080
And got to get prepared because we got some road shows coming up pretty soon.

397
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:20,080
On Monday, I fly to the Netherlands and I have chosen my hotel based upon weblog readers

398
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Curry.com. They say this is the place that has the best Wi-Fi.

399
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,080
That in a 24-7 bar.

400
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I'm not really a drinker, as you know.

401
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,080
At least there'll be life, you know, people will be doing stuff.

402
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,080
And I have bandwidth.

403
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,080
You know, it's me, all by myself, with a television and bandwidth.

404
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Wireless, I think that I'll be just fine.

405
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,080
So I have all kinds of adventures on the horizon.

406
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Of course, we'll bring you the Friday edition of the show.

407
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,080
We've got some cool stuff to talk about tomorrow.

408
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Meet you here on the source code.

409
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Oh yeah, if you want to send me an audio comment, add a link for read.com

410
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,080
