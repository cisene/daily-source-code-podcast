1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, good afternoon everybody! Welcome to the Daily Source Code, coming to you live!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Almost live. Bit delayed, maybe it was yesterday, maybe it's tomorrow. It's from

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Flanders Belgium from Curry Castle. This is your daily...

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh boy, got a lot of stuff lined up for you today. I know I always say that.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
on a quick Skype call to Dave Weiner and I said you know I could do the stuff I

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
receive every single day I could put together three source codes it's just

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
how do I weed through all this stuff to find the good things right well

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
basically my iPod are does a

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I've got a what's new playlist set up. It's a smart list. So basically the rules are it's just like an email

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
If it's happened to be played before and it's in this category then

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
line it up.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
And that's how I get all kinds of cool tunes and stuff coming off the blog

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
dear

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
mp3 feeds.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Just so much so much stuff coming in.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
And this is the source code where of course users and developers make the

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
pot-tay happen.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
And I got to tell you last night I could barely sleep.

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
It was all day yesterday.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I was doing interviews mainly with journalists based on

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
the West Coast.

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,500
So it was LA Times, Wired magazine, Business Week, which was she was in

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
New York, had a great, great chat with her.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Susan is a she's an old radio pirate herself.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I'm expecting a cool article.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Let's see who else that I talked to.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
I talked to publication in Minneapolis, St.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Paul, hoping of course to reach a prince through that interview.

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
And, oh man.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There we go. Leo La Porte has a radio or whatever.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
So, he's going to interview me tomorrow.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
That'll be a radio interview.

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I've been doing just so much work on this that I got in bed last night and I just had

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
URL ipodder.org circling my head and I started to, I got like cold.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
had to pull out a fan to cool down and to walk around.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I was buzzing.

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I was just electrified, full of energy.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
You know what that's like when you can't sleep?

39
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
It's just like sparks flying off your brain, man.

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
So that usually means that I'm really excited about something,

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
and I am because this is just so nice,

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
everything that's taken place.

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
So I've got a couple of songs that I want to play for you.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Of course, I also want to talk about some iPod'r stuff.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
just bringing up the speed on what the latest developments are and what's going on.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I've finally had some time this morning to start updating the directories on iPodder.org.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I'm far from finished. What's cool about the directory, you have two. One is the software

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
directory. Now I'm still working on getting all that together. It's a little harder to

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
figure out who's doing what and where. But since I voiced that concern, I'm getting a lot of

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
emails with the introduction saying, okay, we're the new iPodder.net team. Here's who we are.

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,500
If you go to iPodder.org and you go to the shows directory, there's a hyperlink and you

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,500
click on it and you get a form and you can say, okay, I want to add this show.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Just type in the URL and the RSS feed of your show and I'll add that to the directory.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
That resource is finally picking up a little bit.

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
But I also want to do a redesign and just get this a little bit tighter and make it

56
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
a little more efficient for everybody.

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I've had some excellent offers of help.

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Gregory is offered to help.

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,500
So I'm working on setting up some stuff to make it a little more easy to work with.

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
See what else we've been doing.

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh, here's something.

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Actually, I'll talk about that in a second when I get to iPodder.

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
First I want to do a request song that came in from...

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Ray, I think it was, yeah, it was Ray Slakinsky.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I think I hope I pronounced that right.

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Ray, I think he got me started on some bit torrent stuff.

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
He wrote a Python script.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I believe he's the author of Nucleus, which to this day,

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I still have running up on my cloud in the server space

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,500
somewhere.

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
It just scans the supernova bit torrent files

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
for certain keywords.

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
If it finds one, then it pulls it in,

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
and then it downloads the file from the bit torrent.

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
And then, of course, also lets me know.

76
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It notifies me that there's something new.

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
So that's how I get all my recent TV shows,

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
my American TV shows.

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
And he requested.

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
He's also obviously involved in a lot of iPod development.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
And he said, dude, why don't you

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
play this song by Julia Hatfield?

83
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Because this song happens to be about sticking it to the man.

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I can just hear Dave Slusher.

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
His ears are perking up there in Carolina.

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
We're sticking it to the music man, to the music business.

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
So let's just get a little vibe going.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
here on this Tuesday on the SuperSource Code with Julie Hatfield. This is Sell Out!

90
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Right on. This is the Daily Source Code. I'm Adam Curry. Glad to have you along for the ride.

91
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Okay. A couple more notes about iPodder. If you've been following along with the developments on iPodder.org,

92
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I'm happy to let you know that we have three new Windows versions coming out

93
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,500
that will work with a variety of MP3 players and playlist management systems.

94
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
The installs, I've been beta testing some of the installs look really, really good.

95
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
System tray icons, all the stuff you'd expect as a Windows user

96
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
and I've actually broken out the Windows laptop to try and figure,

97
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
try and install them and see what they're doing. The Java version is pretty cool too.

98
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,500
I mean, it's just so much. But what it all comes down to when we've discussed this

99
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,500
on the iPodder development list is making sure that users get that first, oh wow, experience.

100
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,500
And I've had some varying results in the past, well in the past couple of weeks.

101
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Basically, I've heard a lot of this banter going on saying, well you want your...

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
mom to be able to figure it out.

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And that of course is true.

104
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So it's all about the defaults.

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And one thing that we've kind of been sloundering around with is what happens when you first

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
install an iPod or what is the first experience.

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Currently, we've whittled it down to you subscribe to a feed or a couple of feeds and

108
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
it's going to go and get the first couple of shows on the first pass round.

109
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Just so you're not plugging up your machine or you're bandwidth, you're getting some

110
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
joy at that first moment.

111
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're like, oh well, it's working.

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But we thought this through a little bit more and after some conversation on the

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
list and also some requests came in through email is for a default feed and

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
a default file.

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now just hack something together, which is going to have to live with for now.

116
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm not really happy with the URL, but we're going to.

117
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,500
to come off of iPodder.org so that it's identifiable as the default feed.

118
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,500
So essentially, if you're developing an iPodder right now, you put this feed in as your default

119
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,500
subscription to give the users an idea of what a URL looks like.

120
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,500
It'll end in .xml, which of course not all RSS feeds do.

121
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
But when you see it, it's a little easier to visualize.

122
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
And the feed basically will just sit there and be dormant.

123
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It only has one file in it.

124
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
So that means it's going to bring in that file.

125
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
It's half a meg.

126
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
to get pretty much instant joy as a user.

127
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
And well, I'll do that.

128
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Actually, I have it right here.

129
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm just going to play the default welcome

130
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,500
that you will get whenever you flip open an iPod or upon a first install.

131
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
And if you have any ideas about how to make this better,

132
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I just try to keep it short to the point as simple.

133
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
It's surely let me know.

134
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
So once you install iPod or if you hear the following,

135
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
you know that it worked.

136
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Hi, I'm Adam Curry.

137
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Welcome to the iPod platform.

138
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Hearing this message means you have successfully installed

139
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
iPod on your computer and you should see a new playlist

140
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,500
on your MP3 player titled iPod test channel containing this file.

141
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,500
You now can add any URL that points to an RSS feed with enclosures

142
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
to automatically receive new podcasts by subscription.

143
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
You can use iPod.org as your guide to new software, news,

144
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,500
and pointers to new podcast directories and services.

145
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
We really hope you enjoy receiving and creating your podcasts.

146
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
And please remember, this stuff's supposed to be...

147
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
fun. So enjoy. Right. And I'm going to take the stick out of my ass. All right. There we

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
go. So anyway, it's just a, it's a placeholder now. And if we come up with a better script

149
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
or I'm not too happy with, you know, the, the just briefly passing over an RSS URL,

150
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you know, is it, is it simple enough? Will people, will people get it? Do you need any

151
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
kind of knowledge of RSS? I'll tell you a lot of the journalists that I spoke to hadn't

152
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
actually used the news aggregator. They've heard of it. You know, they're working

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
on it. Yeah, I want to test that at home. One of them, I think it was the reporter

154
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
from Daniel, the reporter from Wired. He was using newsgator. So he was, you know,

155
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
very advanced and he knew that it synced up with this machine at home and the

156
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
machine at office, at the office. So there's all different levels, but I want

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
to make it as simple as possible. And maybe we need more fanfare and, and, and

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
some fun stuff or more production. But at any rate, now we have a default

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
feed. And if you want me to change that or change, you know, if you think there's any

160
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
ideas for the MP3, the first welcome MP3. And I think we can do better.

161
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
better. But just let me know. This is just a placeholder for now.

162
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Okay, I already mentioned that I'm updating the show's directory.

163
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Just a couple of pages I found around the net.

164
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm going to go to this now, I hope. Let's see.

165
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Russell Beatty wrote a pretty, and of course as you saw from

166
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
yesterday's show, I'm now linking to all these resources that I'm talking about

167
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,500
source code. And he wrote quite a nice bit about podcasting.

168
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Let's see if I want to get a quote from here.

169
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Now what he's basically saying is he's identifying something

170
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I think I feel happening as well. Is it going to be the MP3 player

171
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
or is it going to be your mobile phone? And I think that they're

172
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,500
two sides of the same coin. We have MP3 players doing a beautiful job

173
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
playing and organizing MP3s and mobility and battery life.

174
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,500
And we have this basically this asynchronous...

175
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
where you connect your iPod to your machine

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and it updates with new stuff thanks to iPod or whatever

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
you know, whatever you downloaded and paid for

178
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
if it comes to music it will also

179
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
automatically sync up your machine.

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And of course what the iPod is screening for

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is some type of connectivity that is wireless.

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So I can fully see that being Bluetooth,

183
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can see it being WiFi, but also I could see it being

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
third generation cell network.

185
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Could be UMTS or GPRS or ABC Element OP

186
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
whatever the hell all these acronyms are for

187
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
because a lot of cell phones now have MP3 players inside.

188
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And I think that this is all just a function

189
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
of what kind of iPod or software do you need?

190
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It seems to me that most handheld devices these days

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
are a lot of them are running Java.

192
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So I think the Java iPod or development

193
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is gonna be really important for cell phones.

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Their storage capacity is growing but leaps and bounds

195
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
whether it's a...

196
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,500
half a gig now. I have a half a gig of my camera which fits happily in my cell phone.

197
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Granted, the OS, just the power of the process, takes a little while to create a directory

198
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
listing everything that's on the card, but it does work. And you can certainly store

199
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,500
stuff on it. And what a cell phone does really well is connectivity. It's good at roaming,

200
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,500
it's good at picking stuff up, and it can be made intelligent to grab stuff off of the

201
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:22,500
network during off-peak hours. There's just all kinds of all kinds of ways to do that.

202
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,500
And I think that that's why iPod.org is going to be important for quite a while now

203
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
because this is

204
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I've got this type of device.

205
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I want to get my podcasts on it automatically.

206
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
How do we make this happen?

207
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
So that is the resource for you.

208
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,500
And Russell is saying that he thinks, and I got to agree to a certain extent, that he

209
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
feels that cell phones will get there quicker than the rest.

210
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Hi, hon.

211
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Bring me a candle.

212
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Thank you.

213
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Aromatherapy?

214
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Relaxing.

215
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
What? Don't stick them where?

216
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Those, those batteries.

217
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Uh-huh. Thank you.

218
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Go to Sada.

219
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Patricia just came home from doing grocery shopping.

221
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
And she's totally into the production chain now.

222
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
She brought me two 9 volt batteries because I seem to eat a lot of food.

223
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Thank you.

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I said, please go get him.

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And well, she told me where I could put him.

226
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And you know what?

227
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The sun don't shine.

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Anyway, also had a, let's see, there was a,

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Scobal had an interesting post, Robert Scobal from Microsoft,

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
who was also becoming, you know, really quite a cheerleader

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
in all of the stuff.

232
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hold on a second.

233
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I can find it.

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, basically there was a conversation about iPods

235
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
with Steve Ballmer of Microsoft.

236
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I'll point to this as a part of the post for this podcast.

237
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Scobal pointed out a lot of that conversation

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and there's a transcript of it.

239
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And well, I guess the bottom line is, you know, all,

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
everyone who uses an iPod as a pirate, right?

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're a thief.

242
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's kind of the gist of it.

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And Scobal says, whoa, wait a minute.

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know, hold on.

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That just ain't true.

246
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Or at least he posted about this.

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And because what we're doing with these podcasts, you know,

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
bar the music rights that we may or may not be infringing upon,

249
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
which is easily solved by not.

250
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
doing that, the content of the message is in the message, right?

251
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
But that's also solvable, I think.

252
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
You should be able to license that.

253
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
We've talked about that before.

254
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
But the one thing I'm really happy about is because I played a bit from the Gilmore Gang

255
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
yesterday.

256
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
The Gilmore Gang actually is posted now, so I don't feel too bad about previewing a

257
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,500
bit on yesterday's source code before the show was even up.

258
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I think it was Steve Gilmore talking about Scoble pulling stuff out of his ass and

259
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
being such a supporter of this stuff.

260
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
And I said, yeah, you never underestimate the bandwidth of Scoble's ass.

261
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Well, apparently he almost crashed while he heard that.

262
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I got to be careful.

263
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I should say warning, I'm going to talk about you now.

264
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Be careful.

265
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Put down your coffee.

266
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Don't be dreaming.

267
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Don't be driving a car.

268
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Yesterday I had Hugo Schottmann on the show just briefly.

269
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
And I do want to hook up with him later this week or maybe over the weekend.

270
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Hugo is really leading the charge in a lot of the set ups of how we get our audio working.

271
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
And we need more help.

272
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
We need people.

273
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
who were doing podcasting on Windows to send in screenshots, advice, just give me a URL

274
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to point to because it's such a small percentage and I'm now even getting the questions, well,

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
if I just get a Mac, will that solve all of my production issues?

276
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And no, in fact, I think it should be just as easy if not remembering a little bit of

277
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
how the PC architecture works, maybe even easier. It's just all kind of hidden within Windows.

278
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Not that it's not, you know, that it's not hidden within a Macintosh, but in Windows you have a

279
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
little mixer panel and I know that you can you can mix and match audio feeds because I've done it,

280
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I've done this before on Windows. So we really need some help on that. And while we're on that

281
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
topic, Rogamiba software who makes Audio Hijack Pro for the Mac and as they say themselves,

282
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
have no plans on porting to Windows, I think they're pretty close for the Mac, you know,

283
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,500
close on understanding what we need and they've got a weblog, I don't know if it's the head

284
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:39,500
of development but there's a weblog at rogomeba.com which of course will also point to.

285
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
We just got to keep the conversation going because they're the guys for the Macintosh

286
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
that can make this happen.

287
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Something else and I really want to you know put a big shout out to the Skype Skype developers team.

288
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
We're working on Skype for Mac OS I think we're now at beta.

289
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's check.

290
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I have it running here.

291
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Where beta, come on, about Skype.

292
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What does it say?

293
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Beta 0.10.0.1.

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Right on.

295
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You know, so obviously I'm not complaining too much because it is working

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and by far it has the best sound quality far and above iChat, AV with AIM,

297
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
far and above the X10 stuff.

298
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Skype really has the quality going and they seem to be able to keep

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the connection a little bit longer.

300
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But if we need to get to the developers of Skype, I don't know,

301
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sure on PC it's a little more advanced.

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It was born on the Windows platform.

303
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But for the Mac there's only one thing we need to make it the,

304
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
well two things, to make it the perfect application for enhancing

305
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
a podcast and doing a little bit more.

306
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The main thing is we need to be able to switch

307
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
audio devices that the application uses.

308
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Now this is, I know it's, and none of the, I'm sure none of this is trivial, you know,

309
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,500
when I just want to make one little thing happen in my iPod or script, it took me two weeks.

310
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I broke everything and overwrote old code and, you know, it's, by no means trivial.

311
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,500
But a lot of Mac applications that use the core audio driver allow you to select between

312
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,500
different audio devices. So where you can, on the built-in audio device, you can select between

313
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:39,500
the default or line in or your built-in microphone. But I can also choose a virtual audio device,

314
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,500
like Soundflower, which we talked about, or an external one, like the DigiDesign breakout box.

315
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
But Skype doesn't allow you to set those preferences. And I think that it's, well,

316
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
from a development standpoint, what needs to be done is those hooks need to be put in,

317
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,500
so that you can select that in the preferences. Once we do that, you know, then, first of all,

318
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,500
it'd be a lot more stable because high-jacking applications.

319
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
applications and then adding applications to it that really aren't talking to the sound

320
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
drivers in the same way, just like Skype does currently, makes for shit to happen.

321
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It crashes, it can just disappear, sometimes it gets really slow and buggy, and logging

322
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
may even be on for all I know within the beta client.

323
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But if we have any way to get in touch with the developers, let me know, because

324
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
we need their help.

325
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And we can make their product better.

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And add to that the ability to conference two calls together.

327
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And then we're really talking, because with Skype out, you can basically make a

328
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
phone call anywhere in the world for about four or five cents a minute.

329
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And the quality is equal to actually sometimes, because you're just calling

330
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
a landline phone, it's a little bit worse than if you're calling someone directly.

331
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What I'd like to do is I'd like to be able to make a Skype call with Dave,

332
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
for instance, that'll be a direct Skype call, no phone system in between.

333
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And then like the conference in, another person or a phone call, you know, if we could add

334
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,500
one or two more lines to Skype then it would be great.

335
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
So any help that we can get on that is way appreciated.

336
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Did you know that there's a new movie coming out about the life and times of Peter Sellers?

337
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,500
I saw one of the actors, a couple of the actors were on a late night talk show in England

338
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
while we were there over the weekend.

339
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
And it looks like a great movie.

340
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
And while I was thinking of that and just running through the iTunes playlist today,

341
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I bumped across something that is classic Peter Sellers in reminiscence of the Beatles that

342
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
we played on Trade Secrets the other day.

343
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Here's Peter doing his rendition of She Loves You.

344
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
This is the end of the video.

346
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Thank you for watching.

347
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,500
I have made several experiments and I have come to this conclusion.

348
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
So?

349
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,500
You think that you have lost your love?

350
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Well, I saw her yesterday.

351
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,500
It is you that she is thinking of and she has helped me ever to say.

352
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
She says she loves you.

353
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Yeah!

354
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Yeah?

355
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Yo!

356
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Ya!

357
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Ya!

358
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Ya!

359
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Ya!

360
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Ya!

361
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
She loves you!

362
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Ya!

363
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Ya!

364
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Ya!

365
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Ya!

366
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Ya!

367
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Ya!

368
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

369
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Ha!

370
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
He said,

371
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
You hurt her so!

372
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Good!

373
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
She almost lost her mind!

374
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Good job!

375
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
And now she says,

376
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,500
She knows that you're not the hurting kind.

377
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
She says she loves you.

378
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Ya!

379
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Ya!

380
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Ya!

381
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Ya!

382
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
She loves you!

383
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Ya!

384
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Ya!

385
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Ya!

386
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
She loves you!

387
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Ya!

388
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Ya!

389
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Ya!

390
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Ya!

391
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
You know,

392
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,500
It's up to you.

393
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I think that it's only fair.

394
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I can hurt you too.

395
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
She loves you

396
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
BOOF BOOF BOOF

397
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Alright, Peter Sellers, she loves you.

398
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, here on the source code,

399
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
and only a version that Peter Sellers...

400
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
some tunes, because hey, it's Tuesday.

401
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's like it's the day when we kind of are getting over Monday, you know, just getting

402
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to the vibe of things.

403
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Grace Jones pull up to the bumper.

404
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm not a problem for me.

405
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm not a woman who goes into a maze.

406
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
For love, you're a problem for me.

407
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You don't have to be.

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
For love, you're a problem for me.

409
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm not a problem for me.

410
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
For love, you're a problem for me.

411
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Don't ride,

412
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
go away.

413
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Wagging,

414
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
unquiet,

415
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
all right.

416
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This night.

417
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
All the way down the hall,

418
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the lord of you and me.

419
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This place forever.

420
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
One you my friend

421
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Life is short of it's walk

422
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
One you see tomorrow

423
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Shining in the dream

424
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
You leave your heart on your heart

425
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Short of you, my love

426
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Can you love me more, see

427
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Short of you, my love

428
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Can you love me more, see

429
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Short of you, my love

430
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You know, I just realized you were probably doing exactly what I was doing.

431
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The minute a little break happened, you like crank up the volume, I did that on my laptop

432
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Damn if I didn't fuck up the reporting

433
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
If Jones pull up to the bumper, baby, and drag it straight into Queens on the source code,

434
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
so that's lesson learned.

435
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Do not turn up the volume on your Macintosh while doing a podcast.

436
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So many things that...

437
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
There are times when I just say, screw it, I want to get all my mixing equipment out,

438
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
all my outboard gear and just only use the computer to record it.

439
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I get as far as...

440
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I go to the closet and I'm going to open this up and get all my gear out because I

441
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
know it's going to be perfect.

442
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I say, no, we've got to figure out how to make this work.

443
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We are very close.

444
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We're getting a lot better.

445
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I've got the next trade secrets that I do with Dave.

446
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I hope to have a good Skype quality call.

447
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So we're working on all of this test.

448
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
By the way, thanks to Tom from Down Under for the Peter Sellers Hard Days Night link.

449
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He sent me that one.

450
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Tom also, by the way, has been following my radio career since the early 80s.

451
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Even at the Pirate Radio Station, I was working at an Amsterdam.

452
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I had a radio show which started around 83, 84, which I did with a partner called Curry

453
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and Van Inkel.

454
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
His name was Van Inkel, of course.

455
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,500
And, you know, we did hundreds of hours of radio and I have hundreds of...

456
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:38,500
of skimmer tapes and the skimmer tape is basically when you're on the air live and you crack

457
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
the microphone then it starts recording and these are all cassette supports, that was

458
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
the technology of the day.

459
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Really basically just a micro switch, you open up the fader on your mixing board or

460
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,500
you open up that channel and it clicks the pause switch and it starts to record the

461
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
air signal so that after the show you can go back and listen to yourself and listen

462
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,500
to if you sucked or not, which of course we all think we sucked and that's a skimmer

463
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
tape and that's also an air check tape which you'll hand to the next program

464
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,500
director down the line say hey here's my stuff that I did on station A.

465
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And what Tom has done, he's jumped on the iPodder wagon.

466
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And he is, and I added it to the directory, to the iPodder.org shows directory,

467
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and it's much more for my benefit.

468
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But he's put his entire archive, he's loading that up into RSS files, which is great.

469
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I'm sending him two boxes of tapes as we're about to move.

470
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm so happy I can do this.

471
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm sending it off to Australia, and he's going to digitize all that.

472
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I guess he's going to put those on the feed as well.

473
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So that's just another perfect use of this kind of technology.

474
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
If you do a show, if you do a live radio show, you're working at a quote real radio station,

475
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
then get an MP3 archive going, and just add that to your RSS feed so

476
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that you can expand your listenership overnight.

477
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Just briefly talking about a couple more things we could use.

478
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
If you're thinking about doing a podcast, and really a podcast,

479
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
it sounds like we're doing all this difficult stuff.

480
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But if you have the balls to record your own voice, then you're already there.

481
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And you can do that on almost any computer today.

482
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
You don't have to get fancy with mixing in songs and tunes.

483
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,500
You can even sit in your car and play something on the CD radio.

484
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Car is great because you sit in your car while it's not moving preferably.

485
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
You've got a closed sound environment.

486
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
You're mobile so if it's loud, where the ambient noise is loud, where you are, just

487
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
don't...

488
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You've got a power supply, you can start recording, and you can use your CD player, you can use

489
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
your cassette player, you could use your MP3 player connected to your car stereo, and just

490
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,000
put a mic...

491
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
It'll work.

492
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
It'll be a little, it's a hack, but it'll work.

493
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
And I've heard people do it.

494
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,500
But more importantly, if there's anything that you're an expert on, just like web logging,

495
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,500
if you do a top five stock picks of the day, record it.

496
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,500
And if you don't know how to make an RSS 2.0 feed out of it, let me know.

497
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
We'll try and help you out.

498
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Or just join the mailing list.

499
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Just check out iPodder.org.

500
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
We're happy to help.

501
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Short is good.

502
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Short stuff is really good.

503
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
I'd love to have just a little quote of the day.

504
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,500
You know, if someone could do one quote of the day, there's lots of quotes of the day services,

505
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
but they're all text based.

506
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
So here's something you could do.

507
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
You wouldn't have to write.

508
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,500
All you have to do is every single day just record these two lines and then whoever the

509
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
quote was by.

510
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,500
And it'd be nice if you could post the quote in text and link to the source or whatever

511
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
if we wanted to have it.

512
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,500
But those types of things I love to see on my playlist.

513
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
A joke of the day.

514
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
A stand up routine of the day.

515
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
These things really work.

516
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Why do you think David Letterman's talk...

517
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
top 10 list is so phenomenal.

518
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
By the way, Dave, if you're listening, Dave Letterman,

519
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
give us the top 10 list.

520
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Cut an audio recording of that and make a feed

521
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
so we can listen to it every day.

522
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
We love the top 10 list.

523
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I shouldn't have worked on the iPod platform.

524
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I think it will.

525
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay, one more thing I picked up.

526
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
This is in the Equal Airtime Department.

527
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I picked up from the Blog Digger Media Feed.

528
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We've done lots of songs and mixes about President Bush,

529
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
so it's time for one about the next president

530
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
of the United States, John Kerry.

531
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Democrats got a man named John.

532
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Got no clue what...

533
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Flip, flopper and roll in the equal airtime segment on your daily source code.

534
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Hold on a second, phone is ringing.

535
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I'm expecting a call actually.

536
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,500
So you know what, we're gonna leave it at that for today because I do have phone calls

537
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,500
coming in and I'm gonna get this compressed and shoot it up to the server for consumption.

538
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,500
