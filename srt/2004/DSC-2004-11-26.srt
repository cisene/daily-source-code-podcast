1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And it's Curry!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The power of the Lord is always...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And all everybody!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How you doing? Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It is Friday evening.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And God, it's Friday.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's November 26th, 2004.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good Daily Source Code.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The power of the Lord is always...

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As you probably noticed, I managed to skip a day for a podcasting.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Although I didn't really intend to do it.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But it kind of finniggled my way through...

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thanksgiving.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And now is it...

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thanksgiving?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Or is it thanksgiving?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because...

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't know.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But that's my family.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Like cousins.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Always say thanksgiving.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I've been saying thanksgiving.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So...

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's awesome.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's like...

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It doesn't matter who I'm thankful you're here.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Users and developers party together on the Source Code.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We got stuff to talk about today.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Including some cool stuff.

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It turns.

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It turns.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Power of the Lord.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Power of the Lord.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Power of the Lord.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Power of the Lord.

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We do it.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So I spent some time at my favorite hangout today in town.

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's Starbucks.

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Downloaded a whole bunch of podcasts.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Which I'll need because I'm off a little journey tomorrow.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to the Netherlands and Belgium.

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Check up on the castle.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Which is just about to be handed over to the new owners.

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know if my mail was sick when something's coming.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Because it actually turned off when I'm going to podcast.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And it's on my checklist.

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know, turn off iPodder when you're podcasting.

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Power of the Lord.

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And maybe you should turn off email or write it as well.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It is time for a garbage show of robotic.

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the...

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I had something new, especially I wanted to use here because...

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here you go.

58
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is the Michigan drum cadence part of the...

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
None RIA music that we play here on the show.

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This came through...

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I guess I'm still on email.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think there's even a podcast coming out.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A drum podcast.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Check this out for a second.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was really rock.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pop it up.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know, they don't have that almost anywhere else in the world.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But in the United States, they have drum bands that swing the way American drum bands do.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't think they've ever seen a drum band in any other country during this sport

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
or a half-time or anything like that.

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is...

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's nice.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Michigan drum cadence.

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So that was just a little bit of drums there for you.

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's see what's happening.

79
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A lot of responses today from the culture show, which aired on BBC 2.

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Last night, Thursday night, which was the way we celebrated Thanksgiving here

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in the cottage in the UK.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We had our nice turkey dinner.

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We had a TV turkey dinner, Patricia Christina and I.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And at 7 o'clock, the culture show came on.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I should actually find out how many people watched it because the viewing numbers here are

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
it's nice.

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can get millions of people watching the BBC easily.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And it was a pretty good time, I guess.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, I guess the time slot was good.

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They started off with something about some Welsh cultural centrum.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Which I hope people didn't immediately go,

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
which is apple way.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It was marginally interesting for me.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But we were at like item number two all-out podcasting.

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was extremely happy with the way it turned out again.

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Kudos to Colin and his crew who put that all together.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There is a...

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now the website itself, BBC.co.uk slash arts slash culture show.

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Didn't have a archive video up yet.

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And even worse, I'm not quite sure how this happened,

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but they put a link to podcast.org,

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
which is a site that hasn't been maintained since October 20th.

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I've contacted the owner.

104
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I said, hey, why don't you just redirect it.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He doesn't want to sell it.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's fine.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just redirected to iPod or please put a link up or something.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So people are basically going into a big void.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I don't understand how the BBC could have messed that up.

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know, somewhere someone's not thinking.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And hopefully if someone's listening, they'll change that.

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I know that people have sent emails to the beep to the...

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, here.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let me hear me there.

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The beep.

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's my... I'm getting localized here.

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
People sent emails saying that they definitely have the wrong site

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that they're pointing to.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So on iPod.org, I put up a link to a torn file.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And it's a really high quality MP4,

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
which is immediately a problem because

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think that there's no standard player on Windows for MP4 files.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you can get... and by now people have responded.

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Just look in the comments and I pot it out.

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Or they've responded to software you can use to check out MP4.

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
On the Mac quick time doesn't automatically.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And it's beautiful.

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a really high res 16 by 9.

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So it's a... it's the wide screen format.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I thought it would probably be of some benefit

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to people who haven't seen it, to at least be able to listen to it.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And that's easy enough for me to set up for you

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because I've got it here.

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm just going to play it.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It is about six minutes.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So if you've already seen it, you can skip ahead.

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But I kind of enjoyed listening to it for the second time and watching it.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So let's put it on right now.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Again, this is from the BBC's Culture Show.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is the segment on podcasting.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Enjoy.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now, here's a new term for you.

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Pod casting.

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
At the moment, it's something enjoyed by a small

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
but rapidly growing group of internet enthusiasts.

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And it could change the way that we all experience radio.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It works something like this.

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Anyone anywhere, amateurs we're talking about,

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
can record a radio program and then post it on the internet

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
from where it can be downloaded onto any portable player

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
in particular an iPod hence the name.

152
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So you go on the web when you check out

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
or you find the kind of show you might be interested in,

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
music, discussion, gardening, then you download it

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
whenever you want in order to listen to it whenever you want.

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a sign of the time sign of things to come

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and it should.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sure strike Tara into the hearts of all the radio networks

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
who are trying to hang on to their listenership.

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Zina Sara Weaver has been listening in herself.

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Pod casting.

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, it's coming up on 6.20 coming to you from Flanders Belgium

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
from Curry Castle, almost live.

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It is the Bailey source code.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And God, it's Friday, everybody.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The technology in the ability to make

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
do it yourself internet radio has been around for a while

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and if you know you're way around a computer

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and have the time then you can download MP3 files

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but what Pod casting has done is make it easy and automatic.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If you subscribe to a Pod cast

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it automatically downloads any new shows

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
onto your portable MP3 player or iPod, hence the name.

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And off you go.

175
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Take away time shifted radio to enjoy

176
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
wherever and whenever you want.

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's one little piece of software you downloaded

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and the magic begins.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hey, everybody.

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's Donna Drew Show for November 14, 2004.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm Donna Sally.

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You subscribe to a number of shows

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and there's a directory of five or six hundred shows already.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You pick and choose, you can sample the few things

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and then basically you forget about it.

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Welcome to Tokyo Calling for Thursday, November 3rd, 2004.

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The beauty of Pod casting is that it's just user-friendly, right?

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Plug it in, subscribe, there's your content.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello, wherever you are and welcome to a week with a big win.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This only started three months ago.

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I start off with maybe ten people

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
subscribing to my daily show.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now it's up to 50,000.

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The idea of portable radio on demand,

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
dropped onto a device I just picked up in the morning from its cradle

196
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and take away with me.

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's a really important idea.

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Good, that's out of the way.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
iPods, MP3 players and the introduction of 3G phones

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
have enabled us to listen to our entire music collection

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
where we want and when we want.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Pod casting allows you the same with radio.

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've come to Belgium to meet web millionaire and Pod casting Daddy

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Adam Curry.

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Welcome everybody here to Daily Source Code.

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It was Adam who first had together the programming

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that made Pod casting possible.

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We're Pod casting now.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're Pod right now and how much subscribers you have?

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
50,000 more or less.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I post casting to 50,000.

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
At least.

213
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
At least.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
At least.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We have last count 592 podcasts in the directory.

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And that's by no means everything.

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Every single day there's new podcasts pop, popping up.

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I just added radio for it to the directory.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That just happened this morning so it's going so incredibly fast.

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Just a captain deal.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think I'm going to be reading the raven.

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's a lot of stuff out there.

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But it's certainly not as slick as Adam's.

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There's a certain knife charm about some of the radio programs.

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And it gets some interesting humorous, some wacky and odd stuff.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But it just makes me really interesting listen on the,

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the training on the mornings.

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Today's the day we learn who our new leader is or we don't.

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This woman who does the tap dancing podcaster news.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
At least we know the turnout will be heavy.

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No one really knows who she is.

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think she's a newscaster who's been fired from a couple of jobs.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So she's totally right for pod casting.

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Podcaster.

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is one of my favorite ones coverville.

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The vapors, the hollies and Hank Williams senior coming up tonight on Coverville.

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There's a podcast that I've tell Keaton Alaska.

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Guy is wife living in this 12 by 12 cabin.

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I just got back.

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm running late.

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can't even click directly.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A lot of it's just American talk radio done by Geeks.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So you can imagine a lot of stuff they're talking about.

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's like how to write great open source software and other

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
since letting topics like that.

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It was written by three kids sitting in a garage.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And they said, well, we can part this over to an animal,

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Macintosh.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The world of pod casting with joysticks and it's amateur status.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's chaotic, it then provides.

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's its charm, though.

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thing is it's growing really fast.

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And the big boys have started to take notice of it.

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Some public radio stations in America regularly pod cast editions of their shows.

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The BBC have tried it out.

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Pod casting in addition of Melvin Bragg's radio for program in our time.

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Commercial, music-based radio is also something around.

260
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But for them, it presents some challenges.

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The music radio will be as terrified as this as the labels were of peer-to-peer file sharing

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and illegal downloads, because the undermines their basic economic model.

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Music radio is basically funded by advertising.

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Anybody who's got an iPod will just zip through the ads.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He's fast forwarded, why wouldn't you?

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So if you sit in our independent radio thinking,

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that's the way of extending my reach.

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's the way of getting a new audience.

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I want to be tied to this incredibly cool piece of technology.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But they're not going to use their heads.

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So what do I do?

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Radio has not been challenged.

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The way magazines have and newspapers and television.

274
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
iPod alone, 6 million units sold.

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's Apple's numbers.

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
MP3 players in general, 30 million.

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The next cell phones will have 600 million MP3 players just waiting for something to put on them.

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So there was an incredible void just waiting to be filled up.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The feature could be absolutely huge.

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But if and when established radio stations muscle in,

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
let's still be room for podcasting's amateur pioneers.

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Some of the stuff go fall by the way side.

283
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But it doesn't mean that that's better than the Don Andru show

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
or the rock and roll geek show or the Engagit podcast.

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's all different forms of entertainment.

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it's really equalizes it.

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Everyone can party along.

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And we want everyone to party along.

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Zena Sarawira reporting.

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And if you want to listen to some of those podcasts yourself,

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
there's more information on our website.

292
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Boy you own, yo you own your are you own yourself,

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
excellent piece.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And just watching that again,

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
reminded me,

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
just how cool it is to see our listeners.

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know, almost every single voice shared closer to a

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
call, like who is he was it was titles UK podcaster,

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
very cool.

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Was a listener.

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And you saw people on the train and the buses in the sub way.

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And there was one guy, the new Media consultant.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Um, he said something, and I, of course, I, you know, the, the BBC was at my house for seven hours, you know, so there was a lot of stuff that they, well, they just physically couldn't put it into the, into the time that they had, but he was talking about how the traditional guys, the, the traditional radio broadcasts should be freaked out about this or are going to be freaked out about podcasting the way record companies are freaked out about peer-to-peer file sharing, because they, under my, he says, quote, it undermines their basic financial model.

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Um, where people can skip ahead past the commercials, and we discussed that in the interview, and it's okay that it's not in there because it gives me a chance to talk about it again.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What, I mean, this is a really big concept, right? Um, if we had commercials and podcasts, what if we actually made the commercials interesting, huh?

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What if they didn't have to be 30 seconds and with the, or 20 seconds with a 10-second tag? What if we actually had interesting advertisements instead of prepackaged stuff?

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You know, I predict that people wouldn't skip past them. I predict they'd listen to them again, and maybe again, and pass them around and say, wow, listen to this entertaining advertisement.

309
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think we have that part figured out. I really do. Don and Drew are leading the way. They did their first paid advertisement before the, the elections.

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Um, but whatever, excellent, excellent piece. I'm really pleased with that. Of course, there's, you know, so much that, you know, they didn't talk about the podcasting is based on, on RSS and, you know, the basically us podcasts are standing on the shoulders of giants who created all this wonderful infrastructure for us to, to run it all on.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So, okay, but you can't have it all. Still, I'm very happy. And the response has just been overwhelming. Unfortunately, a lot of people couldn't leave comments on my weblog because I use a,

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I use a vanilla site for updates and for a comment. Sorry. And an update came through on the vanilla server, which basically broke my comments.

313
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Thank you very much, Marcus, for figuring out how to fix that. That was definitely a dig. Certainly on Turkey day, but I really, I was happy to get my comments up and rolling again, but people said plenty of email. So, thank you very much. And again, thank you BBC. That was, that was great. And we welcome more BBC podcasts guys. Certainly, you know, don't let,

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you know, this, this one podcast, you know, that you had on a radio for, don't let that be the only one. And I know, because I found some, some websites, I'm a little reluctant to point to them because,

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think, BBC technicians who are probably sitting there under the covers, creating podcast feeds.

316
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So, you know, and I understand that could be kind of touchy from a, excuse me, from a political standpoint, whatever they're doing on the inside, but guys, let me know. I'll totally cover your ass.

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Now, get the podcast feeds out there because you make some great, great programs. Now, while we're on the topic of BBC in the UK, I have a couple of observations to make that we've been here for a little over a week.

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Now, we know that they drive on the left hand side of the road here in the UK. By the way, I have no problem with that. I've been driving for the, for the past week. Now, I have a right hand side drive car, which means I sit on the left hand side, right?

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It isn't a little more complicated when you're, you know, making certain turns. You just can't see traffic that well. You kind of have to lean over. So, eventually when the least runs out on the Audi, I'll get rid of it and I'll buy a UK model. Oh, by the way, have you seen the new 886.0 leader.

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm saving up for one of those boy, I tell you.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
By the way, Audi, I'll gladly endorse your product in my podcast for a little barter there for a 886.0 boy.

322
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I've noticed some other strange things, and I wonder if it's protectionism or if it's, well, I just don't know what the thinking is behind it.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let's start with televisions. Now, it's been well known that on broadcast, and I thought that this has already been fixed, and I thought that most televisions already knew how to understand this.

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Basically, 90% of the TVs we brought with us. We brought about five or six, you know, lots of smaller sets. We like having TVs all over the place, kitchen, you know, etc.

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Can get the picture fine, but can't get the audio. And I remember that the BBC used to broadcast their audio with a different separation of their audio.

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So you can basically hear kind of crackling, but you can't really get a clear audio sound.

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I remember that from years and years and years ago, putting up home rigged antennas to receive the BBC while living in Holland and putting them on my rooftop.

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, you know, it's like Pittsburgh on the wire, let's not only got the BBC on the TV, and it was cool because you got a great signal, but you could never hear the audio.

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I've always wondered why that is. Why? Why would they do that?

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now, these days, of course, you get cable and you plug it in and everywhere in the world, you receive it.

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But if your TV doesn't understand the the English system with their different separation of audio channel or whatever that works, then you're basically hose.

332
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I'm wondering why is that why do they do that? I think it's the only country in the world that has that.

333
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is that protectionism or is it is there a real technological reason? What's the history behind it?

334
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sure there's some geeks out there who will help me out with that.

335
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Number two, and this is even though they use 220 volts over here, which just about the entire world uses, except for the states, which is still 110 volts.

336
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I don't know if that's inferior or superior, I have no idea, but they have different plugs.

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So every single plug you have has to be changed.

338
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And of course, what's happening now is that I'm looking at TV set saying, damn, you know, at the change of the plug.

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It won't receive the audio throw it out by one locally.

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We were smart enough to bring over a whole bunch of Dutch extension cords with, you know, extenders with breakout boxes so you can plug in five.

341
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then basically, you only need one converter module to plug into the wall, but why?

342
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I don't see the UK plug is big and three pronged and ugly.

343
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I do that as very safe because something else that's interesting on all the UK wall sockets is there's a switch on every single one.

344
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So you can switch the actual socket off.

345
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That I think is probably a very good thing, but why are they that different size?

346
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And then finally, and this is the one that I didn't know about everywhere I've been in Europe and in the states.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Your light bulbs have a screw socket.

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Here, the norm seems to be a bayonet, which is basically too little, too little raised things.

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Basically, the way a car lamp fitting works, if you're just seeing that, you know, you push it in, twist it 45 degrees and then it's stuck.

350
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So all of the lamps we brought over, as long as the lamps don't burn out are fine, but the minute the lamps go, we're screwed because you literally can't screw in a bulb.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You have to get a new fitting, so I'm wondering, what's up with that?

352
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What is up with that?

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Please help me.

354
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm trying to understand.

355
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Otherwise, we're loving it here.

356
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We're having a great time.

357
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I wanted to play a Thanksgiving podcast for you.

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Even though it's after Thanksgiving, it was just such a beautiful podcast.

359
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's Tony Khan from Morning Stories, WGBH.

360
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And the reason why I want to play this for you is because it is a personal morning story about him and about his life.

361
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And where he comes from, and it's a very important piece of American entertainment showbiz history that is discussed in his first Thanksgiving.

362
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hi, everybody.

363
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's Tony Khan, the director and producer of Morning Stories.

364
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry I got to cut you off their Tony.

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You are a real podcast to my friend.

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Did you hear that?

367
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He didn't ever bother.

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hi, everybody.

369
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's Tony Khan, the director and producer of Morning Stories from WGBHFM in Boston.

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In the true spirit of podcasting, we're going to start breaking a tradition right away.

371
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Normally, we podcast on Fridays or actually Thursday, Eastern time.

372
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But as soon as it's Friday, somewhere on Earth, like Tokyo.

373
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But this is Thanksgiving Week.

374
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So we thought we'd have podcasts before the tea day actually comes.

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Thanksgiving is the holiday that more Americans travel farther for than any other holiday during the year.

376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So I thought we might tell a morning story this morning about,

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, the kind of trip that Thanksgiving has been for me.

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Starting with my very first one a long time ago.

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The first Thanksgiving I remember was in 1947 in Beverly Hills.

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Given a chill in the air, it might as well have been the North Pole.

381
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
A month before, the House and American Activities Committee had accused my father and

382
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
19 other progressive screenwriters and directors of being communists and traders.

383
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Since then, Warner Bros. refused to renew my father's contract, and no one was calling with work.

384
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He'd been blacklisted, and knew he'd never see another paycheck unless he cooperated with a committee,

385
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
recanted his views, and informed on all his friends.

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Instead, that Thanksgiving he invited them all to a feast with two turkeys,

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
tons of trimmings, and a small fortune in fine wine and liquor.

388
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I remember how noisy the grownups were that day.

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They're jeers at the committee.

390
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
They're cheers of support for the 19 blacklisted men.

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And through it all, my father, lifting everyone spirits, sweeping up the ladies in a tango.

392
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And a dessert, gracefully jiggling a chocolate pudding on his palm.

393
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
A display that not only confirmed his reputation for irreverence,

394
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
but concealed the fatigue and chest pain that had been troubling him for weeks.

395
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He was quite a performance for all of them.

396
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
For beneath the hilarity, lay silence and fear,

397
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
19 of them had already lost their living for having the wrong political ideas.

398
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Who would be next?

399
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And how well would any of them hold up to the hard realities of being jobless and Hollywood,

400
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
or the soft persuasions of the committee that all you had to do to clear your name

401
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
was called someone else, a red.

402
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
When you think of it, it was a classic American Thanksgiving,

403
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
a gathering in a wilderness with a common determination to ride out the winter together.

404
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Are you a member of the Communist Party?

405
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?

406
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I now know what no one knew then.

407
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That the winter of that cold war would last over 20 years.

408
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That it would blanket not just Hollywood,

409
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
but the entire country and denunciations in fear,

410
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and that the group gathered around our table that Thanksgiving would soon fall apart.

411
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
To escape persecution, some like us would flee the country,

412
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
some would stay and try to make a living under another name,

413
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
some would capitulate to the committee,

414
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and in a desperate attempt to save their names,

415
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
drag someone else's through the dirt.

416
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Over 40 Thanksgiving's have come and gone since then,

417
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and have given me if anything and even greater feeling of poignancy

418
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
for the impermanence of all our ties.

419
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Perhaps that's why every year,

420
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
my wife and I now try to welcome at least one new face to our Thanksgiving table

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and to remember the family and friends no longer there.

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's also why this Thanksgiving,

423
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
the first my young son may remember.

424
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I plant a raise a special toast to my father,

425
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
who though he died blacklisted and with next to nothing in the bank,

426
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
left me something that appreciates and value every year.

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The example of his unfailing good humor,

428
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
his refusal to sell out his principles or his friends,

429
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and for a so-called un-American,

430
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
that most American virtue,

431
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the courage, if conscience demanded, to stand along.

432
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Morning stories is produced by WGBHFM in Boston,

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and we podcasted to you,

434
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
well once a week,

435
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
we used to do it on Fridays,

436
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and we'll kind of keep to that schedule,

437
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but come on, it's a podcast,

438
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
whenever we think we've got a really good one,

439
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
we'll have it coming to you,

440
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but at least once a week,

441
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
in the meantime,

442
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
if you downloaded this before Thanksgiving,

443
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
well, happy Thanksgiving,

444
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and if it's after happy trails and many safe returns home.

445
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And from my assistant Gary Mott,

446
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
as well, your Thanksgiving wishes,

447
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
well, Tony, you know, it's Thanksgiving,

448
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
it's a day when family comes together,

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
you know, maybe this is the only time you'll see your family this year,

450
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
but we are asking you to put a smile on your face

451
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and a spring in your step,

452
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and a point on your podcast,

453
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
of the turkey moissens in the album,

454
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and the cranberry sauce.

455
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Like blow, blow, shake your cross.

456
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
No, no, no.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
No, seriously, you know,

458
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I love that.

459
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Those guys are wack,

460
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that's when the podcast really gets good,

461
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but a beautiful story that the Tony come put together,

462
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
therefore morning stories,

463
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
you can check it out at WGBH,

464
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and of course theipotter.org directory,

465
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
excellent,

466
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and happy Thanksgiving to you guys as well.

467
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now, there's someone else who works at WGBH,

468
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that's Rick, I'm going to ruin his name again.

469
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Rick was a witch,

470
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but I, Rick, I'm sorry if I screwed it up,

471
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and Rick has a religious,

472
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
or a podcast that's listed under the religious note

473
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
in theipotter.org directory,

474
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and he got a promo for me.

475
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Thank you.

476
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You are clear,

477
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
it's your voice print identification.

478
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You see,

479
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
we're on a mission from God,

480
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
kind of bad feeling about this.

481
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
This is Rick was wits with the ICM Raw podcast,

482
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and you're listening to Adam Curry,

483
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
really source code.

484
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Cool, man.

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Check it out.

486
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That's the ICM podcast.

487
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You can find it at ipotter.org.

488
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Time now for a tune.

489
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
What I'd like to do,

490
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
whenever I don't really have something

491
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that I've lined up myself,

492
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
as I go to garageband.com,

493
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
check out what at the top picks are.

494
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is from the Pop Rock category.

495
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This is Arthur Yoria.

496
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'll pretend.

497
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I begin as you come in.

498
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It seems to slow that something wrong again.

499
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're the room.

500
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And don't look bad.

501
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So how it seems to scare in my head.

502
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can't explain what it's so too late.

503
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But if you see my signboard,

504
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
don't just turn the phone.

505
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Don't hide our freedom,

506
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you're the best.

507
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm just depressed,

508
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and I'll realize when covering up the rest.

509
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Are you saying when?

510
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And don't leave them.

511
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We'll never make this same mistake again.

512
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I can't explain what it's so too late.

513
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But if you see my time,

514
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
don't just turn the phone.

515
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And you won't know why it hurts too late.

516
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But if you see my time,

517
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
don't just turn the phone.

518
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Don't hide our freedom,

519
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
that I'm listening.

520
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll pretend.

521
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
When we're dancing,

522
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'll pretend.

523
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That I'm listening.

524
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'll pretend.

525
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
When I feel it won't you

526
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and kiss you and take you.

527
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And don't you?

528
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I can't explain what it's so too late.

529
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But if you see my time,

530
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
don't just turn the phone.

531
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And you won't know what it hurts too late.

532
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But if you see my time,

533
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
don't just turn the phone.

534
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I can't explain what it's so too late.

535
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But if you see my time,

536
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
don't just turn the phone.

537
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't hide our freedom.

538
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Hey Adam.

539
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I wanted to join the longest people to welcome you to England.

540
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So welcome.

541
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I also wanted to let you know that recently

542
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I started my own podcast over at

543
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
mashuppodcast.co.uk

544
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
all about my favourite musical genre.

545
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
mashups or bootlegs.

546
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
As well as pretty much anything I want to talk about,

547
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it seems it is my share.

548
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Already it's three times more popular than it was I thought.

549
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Judging by their response,

550
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
a whole three emails.

551
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Anyway.

552
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Best look with the share.

553
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Adios.

554
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah.

555
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
All right.

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I've actually listened to that and I got to say,

557
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I like it very, very much.

558
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Of course, I can't play too much of that because

559
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
there's some RIA issues there.

560
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But mashuppodcast.co.uk

561
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
definitely Ross.

562
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Thank you very much for sending that in.

563
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Now I've been working with a whole bunch of people on the iPod.org directory.

564
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And if you go to the contribute node,

565
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
you can find out how you can actually maintain a node.

566
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We just added an educational node today, which I'm really proud of.

567
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And I've been working with or trying to work with

568
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Andy Skin, I think his name is,

569
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
getting a sports podcast node.

570
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We have one up there, but he wanted to maintain one.

571
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Because he's actually doing a sports podcast.

572
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We've had all kinds of issues with the OPML file that he's creating.

573
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm not quite sure what the problem is.

574
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Although it seems that if you do

575
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
an 8-bit encoding, and I'm going on an old name here,

576
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
because I don't know what the head I'm talking about,

577
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
that messes it up.

578
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I think the best thing to do is just to look at the OPML file

579
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
for the whole directory itself.

580
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
There's something about the headers that are important.

581
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And I wish I could give you all the specifics,

582
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but just copy that stuff and replace owner email and owner name

583
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
with your name and your email.

584
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And then it should be okay.

585
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And you can create these OPML files in a whole bunch of different types of software.

586
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There's also a link in the iPart.org directory to OPML

587
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
to the OPML.org website and to applications

588
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
that you can use on Mac and Windows to create them.

589
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
First time using radio user land, which is great,

590
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
because it has just a real simple outline and all kinds of

591
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
excellent bits in there that I use to hack up my,

592
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
my lethal programming efforts.

593
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Leathal meaning that if you're a real programming,

594
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
you look how to might have a stroke.

595
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Anyway, even though we still haven't gotten the,

596
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
the sports note up and working,

597
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I didn't want to hold back on this excellent podcast.

598
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And I have the URL, it's anti-skinned.com slash skinny.

599
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That's in the podcast production show notes for today's show.

600
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Just a little bit of the skinny on sports because it rocks.

601
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This is the skinny on sports.

602
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
On today's show, we'll be discussing the MBA, the NFL.

603
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Over the hill athletes at university sports in Canada.

604
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Fastest 10 minutes on your iPod.

605
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The sports stories that matter.

606
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the big show.

607
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm Matt.

608
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm Andy.

609
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
First quarter is coming up.

610
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
See, that's what I like about it.

611
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
These guys totally are making a show that I can handle.

612
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I don't know shit about sports.

613
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I do know liking a little bit about what's going on.

614
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You know, of course, I follow some stuff.

615
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But this is exactly what I want.

616
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You know, I want 10 minutes.

617
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Pop out of my iPod.

618
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Give me the top stories.

619
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I love the over the hill stuff, the over the hill athletes.

620
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's perfect.

621
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Great podcast.

622
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Skinny on sports.

623
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Anyskinned.com.

624
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Check it out.

625
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Something else that's exciting that we're working with users and developers on is

626
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
a bit torrentizing the iPod or process.

627
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What does this mean?

628
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
If you're a podcaster,

629
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
most podcasters by now who have been keeping out of it

630
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
have been going, going strong, doing regular updates,

631
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
which doesn't mean every single day could be every week

632
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
or every month as long as you're in that groove

633
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and trying to be consistent.

634
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That's how you keep listeners.

635
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That's how keep listeners interested at least.

636
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Is that, you know, the more success you get,

637
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the more bandwidth your podcast starts to eat up.

638
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's exactly what happened to the Ken and Squip show.

639
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
My old buddies from thinking of, from thinking of ideas.

640
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So one of the fixes to that is instead of just transferring

641
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
these MP3 files as MP3 files from one web server

642
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
that you probably pay for, you know,

643
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
your bandwidth to all these people to the iPod or download programs

644
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
is to split it up and share it with a wonderful peer-to-peer

645
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
sharing protocol called BitTorrent.

646
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That's probably heard about this, if not,

647
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
do Google search for BitTorrent.

648
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And what we want, and when I say we is day-of-one

649
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and I've been thinking about this for a long time,

650
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
lots of people have been thinking about it.

651
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Shit, Dave Slusher has been distributing

652
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
his eVlogenus Chronicles through BitTorrent for weeks now.

653
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Is we want to make it so that it's a little more transparent

654
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
the way we set this up.

655
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What does that mean?

656
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It means that if you're currently creating a podcast feed,

657
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
we're going to make it real simple for you to add

658
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
BitTorrent capability.

659
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Now, with BitTorrent capability,

660
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you could literally run your podcast

661
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
over your home broadband connection.

662
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Because all you have to do is be basically

663
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
seeding at least the file from your connection.

664
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And once other podcasts are downloaded,

665
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
they'll also be serving this up to the entire universe.

666
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And we've seen, particularly from Dave Slusher's example,

667
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
this works really, really well.

668
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's very efficient.

669
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And of course, what you want is you don't want the situation

670
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I had in Belgium.

671
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You want a situation where you have an ADSL or a cable

672
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
modem.

673
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We have unlimited bandwidth.

674
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Sure, it's limited in how fast it can leave your home

675
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and go into the Internet,

676
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
but just not the amount of data.

677
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And I think most home providers have that by now.

678
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That's what I've ordered.

679
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
By the way, I didn't go with the BT,

680
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
British Telecom.

681
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I went with another outfit,

682
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
which I'll post a link to, who have unlimited bandwidth

683
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
for my home here at the cottage.

684
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And I've put a link to basically a request for comments

685
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for this Bitcoin RSS module.

686
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What it means is you'll be,

687
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
instead of having to make two different feeds available,

688
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
so people have to choose.

689
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They want the Direct MP3 or the Bitcoin.

690
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Most of the iPod are software by now,

691
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
supports Bitcoin.

692
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So now we're just making a little extension on to RSS,

693
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
which is your podcast feed,

694
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
so that your iPod or software will be able to recognize,

695
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
oh wait a minute,

696
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
there's a bit torn version of this,

697
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and if you've decided to use Bitcoin,

698
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
it'll use the Bitcoin to download

699
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
instead of the MP3.

700
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And eventually,

701
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I predict that we'll be turning off a lot of the MP3 stuff

702
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and just using BitTorrence as we progress.

703
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But that'll take quite a while,

704
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
but it's going to be a lot more efficient for everybody

705
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
to use this system.

706
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So if you're interested,

707
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and if you're a user,

708
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
you should be interested because we've made it simple enough,

709
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
so you can understand if not,

710
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
leave a comment.

711
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The link is on the podcast show notes for today's show.

712
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Now tomorrow,

713
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and Sunday,

714
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm going to be traveling,

715
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
so I will be online.

716
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
In fact,

717
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I wanted to say that I chose my hotel

718
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
for Saturday night,

719
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
based upon Wi-Fi availability.

720
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So if you're out there,

721
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and you're thinking about what

722
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
do people book their trips for,

723
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
what do people say?

724
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's no joke.

725
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I literally looked at the hotel

726
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that I have stayed before,

727
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and that is recommended hotel,

728
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and decided not to go with it,

729
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
because they did not have what,

730
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
they didn't have any real broadband

731
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that I could see on their website,

732
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and so I went with the Wi-Fi,

733
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and that is definitely something

734
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that's going to get you more business,

735
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
so if you have a hotel,

736
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
or a bread and breakfast,

737
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
or whatever it is,

738
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
please install some Wi-Fi,

739
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
so that we can use it,

740
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
y'all, everybody.

741
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Then I'll do it for one of those

742
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
thank God,

743
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
it's finally so scared.

744
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'll probably post something

745
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and maybe Saturday or Saturday night,

746
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
when I get back,

747
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
so you'll have it on Monday,

748
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and all you know,

749
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
we're just waiting for the bandwidth,

750
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
the castle,

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and still a real pain to ask,

752
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to have to go to Starbucks with the upload,

753
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and actually I'm going to upload this one tonight,

754
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and it's snowman.

755
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Since it's only 10 pm,

756
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it should be up before midnight.

757
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
