1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Well, good afternoon everybody. It's Monday. It's October 4th.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to power all the door is closed.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And I got a lot of partying to do, another fabulous weekend,

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
although I was actually in the United Kingdom.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Trish and I went over to check out the new house,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we'll be moving in, oh man, it's coming up quickly.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Somewhere around the third week of November, so this,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you can imagine there's so much to do,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and meanwhile I'm sitting here,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
three quarters of my waking hours with headphones on,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
talking into microphones, talking to other people

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
by my computer, I have to divide myself up a little bit more.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So this is your daily source code,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and I've been actually doing interviews about what we're doing here,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
podcasting, getting calls from, particularly from the West Coast and the States,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and I'm really excited about everything that's happening.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There's so many things I want to go through today,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to try and make the show a little bit shorter than the normal.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I tend on having a guest on the next source code, which may even, I might even release

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that right after today's show, kind of have like a today plus one.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hugo Shotman, I've pointed to him before and we've spoken about him as really leading

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a lot of the charge, certainly in documenting ways of setting up podcasting software.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And so I said, you know, why don't we talk on daily source code and we'll see if we

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
can come up with something.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, I've been going through more set up shit and I did another trade secrets with

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dave last night.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now granted, I was probably a little bit tired just from coming back from the

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
UK, you know, a little bit of car travel than flying.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And it was around 9, 9.30, 10 o'clock my time when we recorded the show.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was so unhappy with the quality of his sound.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know, we've tried just about everything and the best quality by far

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
of all the different chat.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
that we can use cross-platform is Skype.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It's bar none. It's great quality.

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,500
The latency is, it appears far lower than anything else.

37
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Mind you Dave's on Windows and I'm on a Mac

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
and we're just, you know, guys just want to use something.

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
So we're not great technologists.

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
tweaking everything and it seems that we have almost tweaked everything but Skype is still

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,500
in beta and it won't let you choose a virtual audio device at least not on the Mac.

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,500
So until that's in there it really isn't 100% what we need but we're going to continue,

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,500
we're going to try and use Skype from now on even though it does once in a while also

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
just kind of quit.

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Anyway, so I was really pissed off about that.

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,500
It just it bothered me so much and I started to work on new setups in the meantime.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I discovered something very important as we were doing the show last night, the quality

48
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
of his call degraded significantly and I couldn't figure it out and he says actually we could

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
understand him okay but he couldn't understand me and it's like what's going on and it

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
wasn't until much later that I realized that I'd become victim of my own success

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,500
in a way because it was iPodder that kicked in and started downloading stuff at whatever

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,500
desig-

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
time it was. And that of course used up all the bandwidth and crunched the connection.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So whenever we come up with some software or something that helps you record a podcast,

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
we need a big old red button that turns off all iPod activity because it's like that

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
has definitely messed up a lot of the recording of the show.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I had a couple of new podcasts that I wanted to point to and I have met a resolution

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
by the way that when I post a new daily source code I will have to put up some

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
links on the weblog portion of it and I'll refer it I guess in the somewhere in

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the ID3 tags I'll refer to the promo link of that weblog post so you should be

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
able to find it because there is just too much stuff you know going on now and

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
there's good stuff that I don't want to get lost in the shuffle so I want to

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
start creating some some links to some of these new things.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm seeing how I didn't have GeekSpeak here.

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I have enough for three shows, believe me.

66
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Actually, I'll start off with this one.

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
This one was announced through the iPod or dev list.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I'll just play the intro of it because it's kind of cool.

69
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
It's got some good production value and I think it's...

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Particularly if we're looking at the audience that currently is using iPod

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
or I think this will be a show that's going to fly.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
of missions to explore both homes.

73
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
figure out what that word is that shit

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
the software lands

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
let me just listen to that I get it

76
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
what is it 5 4 3 2 1 and then shift

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
let's listen to that

78
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
what was that

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
1

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
shit

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
hold on a second

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
hi young

83
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
what?

84
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
new?

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
okay I'm coming

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
alright

87
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
looks like we're gonna have to pause this recording

88
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I'll be back in

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
a nanosecond for you as I eat my dinner

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
okay most excellent

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
that was a nice

92
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
35 minute break had some dinner and I'm back

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
and now everything's almost actually

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
on track I think that in about 15 minutes

95
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I can

96
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
give Hugo a shot in a call

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
and we'll talk to him

98
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
so let's play a couple of things

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
before we get to that

100
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I already played you the program one there

101
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
the brand new podcast

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Michael Men's

103
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
brand new podcast

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll make sure I point to that in the notes to the source code for today.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Something else I found that, and a lot of this is coming through on the BlogDigger media feed,

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
of course, now that I have iPodRx 2.0 running on my Mac, and it's really, it's quite wonderful.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I just got to say I love the way it installs and how it sets everything up. Although,

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think that probably something that all iPod developers could think about is creating a

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
a default feed. It's a feed that is already in there just to show the user what even what a

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
URL looks like. Hold on a second, my dog wants the little dog. Come on, so I'll be back. Let me go.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And maybe that's a feed that only has one small, kind of like a hello world. Welcome to my iPodRx

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
MP3 audit. So, you know, just the first experience doesn't necessarily have to be with a 20 or 30 meg

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
download from something like the day.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And I got a... what was this that I found?

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, it was probably an audio blog post, but it was just kind of... well, you'll hear it.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's interesting how technology, even though it's supposed to be so slick, can really,

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
really fuck you up when you're traveling.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is titled 10.0238.mp3.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So don't know where it's coming from. No.mp3 metadata, but check it out.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hey, good morning. It's 4.20am and I'm in Des Moines.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Here's another reason to hate United.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
When I booked this flight to get home this morning, I decided to have it automatically add the flight to my Outlook calendar.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So it told me that I was leaving at 6.12 in the morning.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The trouble is I'm leaving Des Moines at 6.12 in the morning, Denver time, which means I'm leaving Des Moines at 7.12.

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So I'm here at the airport way earlier than I need to be and needless to say.

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I'm a chap that annoyed.

127
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
So that's another way you can use this kind of technology to just let us know how you

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Also, it appears that podcasting is breaking through in other countries.

129
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I posted on my weblog, I posted to an Italian explanation of iPodder and today comes iPod

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
soft audio.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
IpodSoft.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hello. The first audio news from IpodSoft.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's see how it goes.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
First, computer test. Left, right. OK.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So if it works, we'll do it regularly.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh wow, that was tricky. Did you hear that?

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Did you hear that go from left to right?

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's like, that's how they start their show off.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Say, wait, hold on.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We're going to test you now. Left, right, left, right.

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That was cool.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Left, right. OK.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We'll keep.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Anyway, so some German iPod news.

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I could understand most of it being,

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I could speak Dutch pretty well.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But about at least a third of what they're saying is in English anyway.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So I was going to scoop the Gilmore Gang,

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
on the Gilmore Gang, by uploading,

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
or actually by playing a little bit of the,

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
what's that, huh? Two balls?

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Two balls. What kind of balls are these?

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We have cream balls.

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We have cream balls.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Do you have those in there?

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They do now.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I like our donkey balls.

158
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,500
No.

159
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Who's that?

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
No, whipped cream balls.

161
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Filled with...

162
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Filled with whipped cream.

163
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Thank you.

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Thank you, cream sushi.

165
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Right on.

166
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Okay.

167
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
So I said I was going to scoop the Gilmore Gang,

168
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
who did their show live from Nome Dex,

169
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
which was in Lake Tahoe, I believe.

170
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Oh, shit.

171
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Now the other dog wants to go in.

172
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Come here, Jess.

173
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Come on.

174
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Come on, go.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Now, I'm telling you, it's been like this all day.

176
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The phone's been ringing, people interrupting.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I just can't get down to doing a show.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So anyway, I knew that Doug Kay was down there

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
doing the streaming stuff.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I actually recorded the stream of the Gilmore Gang

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and I wanted to play back a little bit

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
because they were talking about iPodder

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and iPod platform and podcasting was great.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now it's jumping up and down as I was.

185
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
in our inn, the room at the inn in the UK where

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,500
was really cool but then raster web audio scoop me to the scoopage

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:33,500
well

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the Gilmore Gang. I think John Udell said something really significant here and I

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
just wanted to share that with you.

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't believe I hit the ball.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Quite impressive.

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It landed in the water.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, but the splash was quite impressive.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This place is so beautiful. I can see just coming here to think or read, though that

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
probably defeats the purpose of the holes with the flags and all.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's something rather serene about walking around here.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You come here every week?

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No, when I can.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm often working on the weekends.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Bummer.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Isn't it?

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Crap. Okay. You know what? I'm pretty sure that that wasn't the Gilmore Gang.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't even think that was John Udell.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think that was the Gilmore Girls.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry, everybody.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm forgetting.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hopefully that had the same effect on you as it had on me the first time.

208
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I was like, what the hell is he playing?

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What does nothing do with the Gilmore Gang?

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Indeed, the Gilmore Girls.

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Always.

212
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Nice to have pizza, rice, and humor on the daily source code via raster web audio.

213
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
So I do have a bit of the Gilmore gang.

214
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,500
This is kind of cool because this in effect is bootleg.

215
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I think I may be posting it before it's even posted on ITConversations.com.

216
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm just going to play a little bit at the end of the show of what Steve Gilmore said

217
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
was so incredibly nice.

218
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Just like Hugo Shopman, I'm going to ask Steve if he'll let me interview him on a daily source code.

219
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,500
He clearly understands the opportunity that is in podcasting and iPodder, etc.

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
And he's very vocal about it.

221
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Check it out.

222
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Final bit from the Gilmore gang soon to be up at ITConversations.com.

223
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:37,500
You know, as somebody, the second executive at a major software company asked me the other day

224
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,500
when's the Gilmore gang going to go, you know, national?

225
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
And I said it's all...

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where did he go?

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Act it.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What do you want?

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I mean, as Chris said, we're being broadcast through the iPod

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
platform to anybody, anywhere, who has access to the network.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The streaming audio that Doug Kay is doing

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is we had questions on the first day of this conference

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
from Australia, from New Zealand.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Georgia.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Even Georgia.

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I just want to say one thing about professional content.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I've been a record producer.

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I've directed films.

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They may not be professional in the sense

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
that they weren't Hollywood blockbusters,

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but I know how that stuff works.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I'm telling you that what Adam Curry is doing

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and what Dave Slusher is doing from Conway, South Carolina

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and what Robert Scobal is doing from pulling it

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
out of his ass.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wait a minute.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Never underestimate the bad.

248
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
with the Robert Scoble's ass.

249
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
It is just as professional, if not more so,

250
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
because these technologies, as they boil down

251
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
and virtualized into a Mac today and a PDA

252
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
or some sort of cell phone tomorrow,

253
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
this is the recording studio of the future,

254
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
and the future is now.

255
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
This is happening today, and it is going,

256
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
when people say in four or five years,

257
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
when the iPod platform really takes off,

258
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,500
they're missing the boat by about four or five years.

259
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
It's happening right now.

260
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
I really encourage you to listen to the entire Gilmore Gang,

261
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
and I'm sure they'll also have other bits of the conference

262
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,500
from NomeDecks up on ITConversations.com.

263
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
I listened to a bit of Will Wheaton.

264
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Dave and I got to figure out a way to be able to record that

265
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
and comment at the same time, because it's funny.

266
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
You listen to something together and you comment.

267
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
You come up with...

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
with wacky stuff and there was also another conference. It was the future of content.

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
session that was and there was also a lot of iPod or talk so make sure you catch

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that it'll probably be another day or so until they get all of that encoded and

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
sorted out you know and this conference is can be pretty grueling

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
particularly if you're doing streaming stuff. So let me see I got about five

273
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
more minutes till we can call Hugh.

274
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,500
past seven right now in Belgium. And I believe he's either in the Netherlands or Austria,

275
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,500
but we're going to find out where he is. But while I was in the UK, I was looking around

276
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:39,500
to see how the British citizens reacted to the presidential debate. And you know, from

277
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
one thing leads to another, and I stumbled across a piece of video, which is, it's all animated,

278
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,500
but I want to let you hear this because the voiceover is self-explanatory. And this, I think,

279
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,500
is something that will be, well, you'll have to check out. Just listen to what this is. It's

280
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:03,500
only about a minute and a half, and it's simply titled, Barry.move. This is how stuff comes

281
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
along, and unfortunately there's no metadata whatsoever, but in the credits, and I'm

282
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,500
going to link to this from my weblog for this source code posting, in the credits

283
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,500
there's all kinds of information about who's behind this and what their drive is. But I

284
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
think it gives a view of what...

285
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But Britons think of the United States in general and perhaps of the presidential elections

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and the world at large.

287
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.

288
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,500
In itself, this goes a long way to explaining the things it does around the world.

289
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
At present, it's conducting a war on terror.

290
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Or more accurately, a campaign against opposition to US domination.

291
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Others prefer to call it the beginnings of the Third World War.

292
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
United States has an insatiable appetite for conflict.

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
career in the 1950s.

294
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
one or other in some corner of the globe non-stop right up to it as a day.

295
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This drive is now led by the weapons manufacturers themselves.

296
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a highly dangerous project.

297
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
It's the door of a new fashion being pushed open.

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The reality, as we see from the Iraqi invasion, is that the presidency has been...

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And this ghastly molecule aims to turn the world into its very own enslaved global mark.

300
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
by Al Qaeda on the World Trade Center. It's just one response to it.

301
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Is this a conspiracy? Quite the opposite. It is a high-profile project known as the

302
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,500
project of the new American Century. People like Dick Janie, Donald Rumsfeld,

303
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Richard Pearl are the major players among politicians right-wing thinkers

304
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
and

305
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,500
The project is a neoconservative manifesto, which includes in its toolbox the unbridled

306
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
use of war and clearing a path for US interests.

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Iraq came entirely from this visible yet sinister group.

308
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And so who's next to wonder Iran, North Korea, France?

309
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
None of us really matter to them.

310
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
So then it goes into some credits.

311
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Barry McNamara, I know that name from somewhere.

312
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
That's who did the voiceover.

313
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:01,500
And then there's a final credit here, knife-party.net, directed and produced by knife-party.net.

314
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
So you want to check that out.

315
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I've heard this theory before about a new world order and the new world movement.

316
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:18,500
And I, yeah, it's the wonders of the internet that gives us the power to have this stuff

317
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
put together, all this art, you know, and be able to play it for you.

318
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
So, you know, this is, keep more of it coming.

319
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't think we'll ever, you know, this is the election.

320
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,500
This is the chance where we have to use all these digital media tools to really get our

321
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
point across and say what we want to.

322
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
You can also, of course, just do it in traditional song.

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I didn't know I was an American

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
to give a damn

325
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Or on patriotic

326
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
For Darren to take a stand for what

327
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Looks like freedom to me, expressions of liberty

328
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Warning our America to be a responsible agenda.

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Didn't know I was a communist

330
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But wanted to share the wealth

331
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So are you than what I believe?

332
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I didn't know I was un-American and uh, just a nice little tune on the daily source code for October 4th, 2004.

333
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Would it be this way?

334
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
I hope I can find out who that is.

335
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Okay, it's time now, I'd say, to see if we can get Hugo on the...

336
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We're calling him via Skype.

337
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There we go.

338
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's like it's working.

339
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Hi, how are you doing?

340
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm good.

341
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm recording already.

342
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
That's good.

343
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
So welcome to the source code.

344
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Thank you very much.

345
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
You know, Hugo, you blew me away.

346
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Hold on a second.

347
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,500
This is, I'm trying to get the, this is exactly why I wanted to call you because I want to

348
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,500
make sure we get, we get squared away on the best personal setup for this kind of stuff.

349
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Okay.

350
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Well, you're kind of breaking up a little bit.

351
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
How am I on your side?

352
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Yeah, you're coming through okay.

353
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I'll say what, I'm going to try calling again.

354
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Okay?

355
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Okay.

356
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Okay, we're, we're back and we've, I think now, by now we actually have it set up so

357
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
that not only will you hear me talking, but we'll also hear Hugo talking.

358
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I mean, Hugo, I mean, I've had so much, you know, success and failure and all kinds

359
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
of crap with this.

360
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I mean, what?

361
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
I mean, help me out here.

362
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Where, where do we have to go?

363
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Who do we have to talk to?

364
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,500
How do we get to the end of this?

365
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
we have to get this working better and do you think that there's something we can bootstrap

366
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that'll get us further than where we're at right now because this is giving me many sleepless

367
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
nights?

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes.

369
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Well, one answer is with the things that we have right now, we can write down different

370
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:15,000
setups and lessons learned and exchange the best setup with each other so that we can learn

371
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and record it somewhere, which I have started on my side.

372
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We have to ask developers to actually create an all-in-all all-in-one

373
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Don't come up with a service.

374
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You've mentioned this service, and probably we've only recorded the fact that you mentioned

375
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
it once.

376
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So, we've talked about it three times.

377
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Tell me about what your idea is, because I've heard a couple of other people mention that

378
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the idea of a service, how do you envision that?

379
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What would that be?

380
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What kind of service can we make?

381
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Can we develop that will bring all of the technologies that we're trying to figure

382
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
out, all of the audio routing?

383
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Can we make something that will bring that to the people who want to do the show

384
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and not worry about the rest?

385
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, I think so.

386
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Just like you had a web log service right now where you post to.

387
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
For instance, Radio Userland, it can run on your own machine, but it can also run

388
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
completely somewhere else.

389
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Now, getting text to that server is...

390
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,500
easy and we have lots of tools to do that already. Audio to it is a bit more

391
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:49,500
difficult and intuitive for just users. Now you could SPP it to the service or email it or...

392
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Well you're talking about it is really is really a publishing system though.

393
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,500
That what you're talking about? Yeah but maybe also a recording system because

394
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:09,500
the next step is you open a line with the server through something that we are all

395
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:17,500
familiar with like iChat or voice over IP and have that be the recording.

396
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,500
And okay and so then the server will record can this in the server or this

397
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,500
service will also be able to combine stuff so say I want to talk with you we

398
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,500
don't have to restart this thing 25 million times it'll just combine those

399
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,500
sources okay

400
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I also, yeah, I'm listening.

401
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, you'll have a chat with multiple people

402
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
or a conference with multiple people

403
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and it'll record everything.

404
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So shouldn't Apple be doing this

405
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
or shouldn't AOL Instant Messenger,

406
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,000
shouldn't these, I mean,

407
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
is this something we really wanna jump into?

408
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Is this something that we as, you know,

409
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
mere mortal developers and users

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
really wanna put our foot into?

411
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Well, we can use those tools already.

412
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We only have to put the pieces together.

413
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
For instance, with SIP,

414
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
there are SIP routers, SIP routers,

415
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that you can reprogram to almost anything.

416
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And it would be easy to add

417
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
publishing capability and, you know,

418
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
those are automatic enclosure generation MP3 encoding.

419
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You can put everything.

420
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
in that same server.

421
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,500
So I think, well that's a, but I think this is an interesting thought, you know, because

422
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:49,500
I have to agree that there is, I mean there's such a high barrier level of entry on doing

423
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,500
this stuff, figuring out how to connect all the bits so you can record the audio and your

424
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,500
microphone and someone else and maybe a phone call.

425
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Is this something that maybe, what's that PBX software that everyone keeps raving about

426
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
it's open source.

427
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah, I have a link.

428
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I forgot the name.

429
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Actually, I had a little time the last week.

430
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
It's too bad that it's bad timing.

431
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Because I was traveling.

432
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I was like in the Netherlands when you were there

433
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,500
last Wednesday and until Sunday.

434
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Oh, OK.

435
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Well, I mean, is this for work related stuff

436
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
that you're doing?

437
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Yeah, I was there for a perfect person.

438
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
And then I went to a family.

439
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,500
And I kind of...

440
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Well, you're allowed to do that.

441
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
You're allowed family visits.

442
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I think there's no such timing as really good timing.

443
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
There's all kinds of stuff that always comes and goes.

444
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,500
But I'm so happy that we could just

445
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
want to reach out to you and just say hi.

446
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
And let you know that I certainly

447
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500
appreciate all the work that you're doing

448
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
on figuring this stuff out.

449
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,500
And I'm fascinated by the service idea.

450
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
And now it's...

451
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Is this something that you would involve your employer with maybe?

452
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Is that something that Siemens would be interested in?

453
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, I'm in a small division of Siemens.

454
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Siemens is really, I'm not in the right division.

455
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So it would be difficult.

456
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay.

457
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
If I wanted to do something with it, then it would mean something from my job.

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Right.

459
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Right, all right.

460
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So what is your background?

461
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What are your hobbies?

462
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
What's the kind of stuff you like to do?

463
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Background from school actually is very technical.

464
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But I started to do consulting early on.

465
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I've been to Cambridge Technology Partners.

466
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah.

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I remember that.

468
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I worked for them in Amsterdam in the dotcom years.

469
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I went to Accenture here in Zurich and went to Austria for a PhD instructor.

470
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
So that's what makes me take as well.

471
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Okay.

472
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Okay.

473
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
And came to Siemens.

474
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Okay.

475
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,500
And what's it like to live in Vienna?

476
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
No, Zurich.

477
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
I'm trying Zurich.

478
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
What's it like there?

479
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Is it nice?

480
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Yeah, it's the Amsterdam of Switzerland.

481
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
It's...

482
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,500
I don't know if that's a compliment or if that's good or bad.

483
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
media. You know, you've got lots of international people, you know, it's

484
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
well, I could get away with, with not speaking German. You know, it's,

485
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
it's lots going on, lots for single, you know, expert type people. Yeah. And

486
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the quality of living is just, it's good. Plus, it's close to the

487
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
mountain. Where you like to ski, right? Exactly. Perfect.

488
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Perfect. Well, you know what, we're following your, your research

489
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
very, very closely. And, you know, I'd like to, now that I've kind

490
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
of figured out what the best way is to contact you, maybe later

491
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
on the week, we can hook up again. And then by then, I'll

492
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
have had some responses, and maybe there'll be some questions

493
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
or reactions. And we can

494
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Sure, I'd be happy to.

495
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, so on email we'll set up a time and a day and then we'll chat a little bit more.

496
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This is a great introduction.

497
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Alright, can you play me a song of the day or is it I'll set up?

498
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's not set up so that you'll hear the song of the day, but I can certainly play

499
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
a song of the day.

500
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Well, I really like Prince, but I just bought the Supper Club 7 and that's like really relaxed.

501
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Have you heard it yet?

502
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
No, no, I haven't heard the...

503
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think I have Supper Club 2.

504
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I certainly don't think I'm anywhere near 7.

505
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Anyway, no, no.

506
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But my setup is bare bones.

507
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I don't have the regular setup subscribed on the site, so I cannot play you any music

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of days and we'll check in again.

Alright, on one y'all.

575
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You hear this old school joint?

576
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Don't you ever touch my stereo.

577
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This set up got good and plenty

578
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
of what you need the most.

579
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And that's

580
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
TRI

581
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
P

582
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah.

583
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Okay.

584
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And so it just keeps on

585
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
jamming and jamming and jamming and jamming.

586
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And it's kind of like,

587
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
you know, it's kind of like the

588
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
gods were playing with this because I've been talking about

589
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Prince. I think

590
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think Dave and I talked about it on trade secrets.

591
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
We, you know, we said, you know,

592
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Prince would totally understand this stuff, right?

593
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He'd be so completely into it.

594
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And

595
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
lo and behold, if I wasn't interviewed

596
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
by Julio

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and Julio works for

598
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
it's kind of, it's a night-ridder publication

599
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
in Minneapolis, St. Paul.

600
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Uh, hold on a second.

601
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Julio, here we go.

602
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Julio Ojeda Zapada works for the, oh there it is, the St. Paul Pioneer Press.

603
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,500
And so I said, you know, as Julio was interviewing me, I said, you know, I think this is all

604
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
meant to be because, you know, Prince is going to read this and then he's going

605
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
to listen to the source code.

606
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
He's going to call up and he's going to get it and he's going to want to use this

607
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
for the distribution of his music.

608
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Okay.

609
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Maybe I'm just rambling on a little bit too much.

610
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,500
I'm going to leave you with one last bit that I found online.

611
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,500
My gosh, I'm not sure where this came from, other than the

612
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,500
blog digger media feed, right?

613
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
You've probably read about the number of times during the

614
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Republican National Convention, how many times different words like

615
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Osama bin Laden, no, I'm sorry, Saddam Hussein, Iraq, war on terror,

616
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
etc., but not Osama bin Laden.

617
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
All these different terms were used.

618
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
over and over and over again and maybe you heard some audio of it. I don't know but someone finally

619
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Went through the trouble of putting this all together into a video

620
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Let me just see I think the video is from

621
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's live. It's probably from C-span and what I thought I'd do is I'd play this it only lasts a couple of minutes

622
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
But it'll really freak you out when you hear how many times they're they're repeating these words and how many different people

623
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And who these people are and so if there's a caption that comes up

624
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Maybe I'll just break in and tell you that what it says like here

625
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
it says, how do you run a convention on a recathive failure and

626
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
so now it starts off with of course

627
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Invoke 9 11 the heart of this great city. We saw a tragedy arrive on a quiet morning

628
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
September the 11th September the 11th September the 11th September 11th September 11th September 11th September

629
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000

630
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
September 11th September 11

631
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000

632
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
11.

633
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
September 11.

634
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
September 11.

635
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
September 11.

636
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
September 11.

637
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000

638
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
September 11.

639
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
September 11.

640
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
September 11.

641
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,500
September 11! September 11 September 11

642
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
September 11 September 11 September 11

643
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,500
This is Giuliani by the way. Now it says no your enemy.

644
00:42:51,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Saddam Hussein

645
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Handle the bin Laden matter appropriately.

646
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And that's just got crits playing and everyone being quiet.

647
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Above all, spread fear.

648
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,500
And danger.

649
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Continuing danger.

650
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Power of danger.

651
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Very, very dangerous world.

652
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Brave new threat.

653
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Horrific acts of atrocities, murderous regimes.

654
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Dedicating to killing us.

655
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Tyranny and terror.

656
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Slaughtered thousands of weapons of mass destruction.

657
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Weapons of mass destruction.

658
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Weapons programs.

659
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
The deadliest of weapons.

00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Terrible weapons.

661
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500

Torture chambers.

665
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Mass graves.

666
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Deadly technology.

667
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Radical ideology of hate.

668
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Terror of threats.

669
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Terror.

670
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500

He's the best one of all of them.

679
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
They continuously have thousands of quotes by Giuliani.

680
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000

681
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000

George W. Bush. Keeping America Scared.

693
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
That's what it winds up with there.

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Wow. I like Barbara Bush's the way she speaks.

695
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
She has a nice accent.

696
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Terrorist, terrorist.

697
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Anyway, that's your food for thought there.

698
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm going to wrap this up. What are we at?

699
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
All kinds of ideas and stuff so

700
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,500

706
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The power of your Insta-Code.
