1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Bye everyone and good afternoon in South Korea it's Monday.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And it's about what is it 430 in the afternoon and coming to you from Curry

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Castle in Belle

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,500
It's frightening. I'm trying to do everything virtual. I'm sitting here with hot metal touching hot metal and trying not to burn myself

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,500
And this is mainly because I got a real panicked email from Doug Kay said oh, you know your the latest source code was out of phase

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Now out of phase is this is what the best way to describe that

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,500
You don't you don't really hear it if you're listening to it on on headphones

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,500
and and look at it this way you know so you send an electric current through the

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,500
wire to connect to the speakers and that produces a vibration now if it's out of

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,500
phase then what happens is the vibrations are happening but they're

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
happening exactly the opposite direction so basically the sound is

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,500
So, and that's usually a wiring configuration and that was pretty sure the culprit was going

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,500
to be the patch cable that I hacked together yesterday to get the 3 to get from the 3.5

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:44,500
millimeter jack headphone jack out from the power book into the mbox virtual or the mbox

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:54,500
external audio device and which has XLR inputs and so I actually called my father-in-law he

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
used to build studios back in old patch cable days and he told me exactly

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
told me where the soldering iron was in my own home which was pretty cool. I had no idea where it was.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So Doug, thank you very much for pointing that out and hopefully this is all in-phase. It sounds

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
good to me now. What I don't have is a phase meter. I have no idea. I have so much software

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
running out. I have so many things patched through. It's just unbelievable. I just did a test

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
with iChat AV and that works perfectly. I can also send stuff back down the line.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now to do that, what I need to do is I need to just in iChat, I can open up the preferences while

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the iChat chat is continuing and just select a different input which is actually from a Q monitor

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
from the MP3 player, the DJI 1800 software that I have. So that works perfectly well.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And just got an email from Steve Garfield. There's good news and he's thinking of me.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's see. Apple's next generation operating system.

27
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
That's going to be Tiger will include an updated version of the company's core audio technology

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:13,500
They'll deliver new tools and functions to improve the audio handling experience of Mac OS X applications. This is obviously

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
cut and paste it in.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So Tiger's version of Core Audio will also support the...

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh here we go.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The creation of aggregate devices,

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
allowing developers to combine multiple audio devices together

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
under the auspices of a single audio device.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Exactly what...

36
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
For example, developers can take two devices with two input channels, combine them to

37
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,500
create a single aggregate device with four input channels, and then let core audio take

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
care of routing the audio data to the appropriate hardware device.

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Lovely.

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Very, very cool.

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Okay.

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,500
So, got to figure out how we can let people know about what we need and how we can get

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
some more cool stuff done.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I was in checking out the iPod or developer list and I actually got an email, the

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
latest version of iSpider and I figured it was time, I've seen a lot of different

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,500
versions go by, I think three in an hour, three version updates at one point, but this

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,500
software kick ass, it's really, really good.

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
The only thing it's missing now is it's almost

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
installer, you double click the installer on Mac OS X, there's also Windows installer,

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
it just opens up, you install the software answering one or two of the typical questions

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
like where do you want it to be installed.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the tip of the very common Apple installer, package installer I think it is.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And it creates a nice little folder in your application folder and everything's all set

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
up.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It talks to iTunes perfectly.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It also sets up a cron job.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I heard David Slasher talking on his Evil Genius Chronicles that the cron job is set

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
up to run every single hour.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I checked it is.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've just got a 00 and the rest of it.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So we'll run at the top of every hour.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That is indeed one thing that maybe just in the install process you could answer a question

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to say, hey, I want to.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But these times and the other thing that doesn't quite have in the install yet or doesn't have

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
at all is an overview of what feeds you're subscribing to, the opportunity to uncheck

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
a couple of feeds or maybe add another one.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But we're so close.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I got to say, iSpider is really good.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm very happy with the performance.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And add to that that it also recognizes bit torrent enclosures.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What it does is so if you've created a bit torrent, then instead of distributing the

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
MP3 file as your enclosure, you're going to distribute the bit torrent file as the

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
enclosure for each show.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
iSpider recognizes that, brings in the enclosure, opens up a bit torrent client,

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
downloads it, and then transfers it to your iPod.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it's phenomenal.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Really, really cool.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I can't wait to try that out.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've just been experimenting a little bit with a couple different.

80
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:28,500
bit torrent creation programs. In fact while I was doing that I did something wrong. I'm not quite sure I was messing around with the server that I have at the hosting.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
running, which is off right now. I did something weird and then Python just, you know, got away from me.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And at a certain point, I tried to kill all the Python processes and it was just out of memory or

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
whatever, just it couldn't handle my request anymore. So I had to have it physically reset

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
at the hosting facility. So I'm going to chill out a little bit on messing around with bit

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
torn on the server. Took hours to get them to reset it. But I heard that even Dave Slasher was

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
thinking of switching. He created Get-A-Closures, which I've been using up until this point. And

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
only today have I switched over to using iSpider. And there's only one thing that I don't believe

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
is in the code, which would be just a great addition and something that would all iPod or

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
script should really do is after it's finished, it's finished, it's run, it's completed getting all

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the new enclosures, putting them into the playlist, then just do an update iPod.

91
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
And I don't know, I think you might have to specify the name of the iPod, which means

92
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,500
we'll have to figure out how to get that name when you connect it to the dock.

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I don't know how to do that.

94
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I'll look into it.

95
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
But maybe that's just a variable you said.

96
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I think with me it's updateAtom's iPod.

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,500
And that would just make it the last perfect bit because now in the morning, if new

98
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,500
shows have come in, then I have to lift the iPod out of the dock and re-dock it

99
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
to get it synced up with the latest shows that came in.

100
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Or I have to go to iTunes and tell it to update the iPod.

101
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
It's just one minor step.

102
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
And I'm just afraid that people are just leaving in and they're thinking,

103
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
oh, OK, I'll get all the latest shows while really they're getting it two days

104
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,500
late because of a delay on downloading overnight and then a delay on the next

105
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
time it's been synchronized.

106
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
And then, of course, something we haven't talked about.

107
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
It doesn't really matter all that much.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is naming conventions.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now you know what, it really doesn't matter I guess.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think if we're all talking the same thing here.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So just keep everything under iPodder.org.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What I'm struggling with here is there's so many

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
different names and brands and things running around,

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
even though this is a total open source project.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I just wanna make sure that if someone's looking

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
for a great iPodder script that they're not

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
overlooking, you know, iSpider because,

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
first you have to come to iPodder.org,

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
then you go into the downloads directory.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, okay, let me see these different ones.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What's iSpider?

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You know, after you've gotten to three different

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
other types of scripts.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So we just think about, are we all gonna call them iPodders

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and specify what they are, you know,

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
iPodder slash or dash whatever,

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
or do we just want all kinds of names?

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It doesn't really matter to me.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's just I think at a certain point,

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we're gonna be done with the iPodder development.

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
At least on the receiver side.

132
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
And then hopefully we'll all start on the publishing side.

133
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I just want to make it easy for users as possible.

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
And that is the type of stuff that we

135
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
want to talk about here on Source Code.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
This is the place where users and developers party together.

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
And of course, a big feature request, which will come up

138
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
soon.

139
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
And I think this is maybe this is the right time to talk about it

140
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
since we're going to be dealing with subscriptions

141
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,500
on the installation process and also going back later

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,500
and adding or unsubscribing from feeds is OPML support.

143
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
That makes a lot of sense.

144
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Maybe that's even the simplest way to edit these subscriptions

145
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
is to do an OPML file.

146
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Of course, you need some kind of OPML viewer or editor to use.

147
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
But somewhere I think that that should be in there.

148
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Makes sense.

149
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
And we probably shall just look at the aggregator world.

150
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,500
And most of the answers are going to be there.

151
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Let's see.

152
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I wrote down.

153
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Oh yeah, there was another thing, another topic.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I saw on the iPod or dev list, which is at Yahoo groups, is something called Coral.

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And it probably is just like archive.org.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And the way it works, basically, is if you have a URL that points to a file, and I think

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it has to be at least five megs or bigger, you basically put either a part of a URL in

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
front of the file name, or in Coral's case, you add something onto it.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You actually add a Coral.org, or I have to check it out.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And you have to specify a port as well.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Anyway, so you're basically just adding something onto your URL of this piece of

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
content at the beginning or the end.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And what happens is that request doesn't go to your server, it goes to a cache.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And they have a whole network of caches set up around the internet.

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
A lot of them is at universities.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then it'll basically store the file there.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And every next request, in theory, it's going to cache it.

168
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,500
to bring in from the cache and not from your hard drive or from your server.

169
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I've used this with archive.org.

170
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
They have a, what is it?

171
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
They call it free cache.

172
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
It's freecache.org.

173
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
It's a part of archive.org.

174
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
And it was working for a while and it worked really great, but then I think stuff started

175
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,500
to fall off the edge or after a while it does get deleted if the file, it gets deleted

176
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,500
from the cache if the file isn't being requested enough.

177
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,500
And I heard a couple things just surfing around that either it wasn't working

178
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
or maybe it was broken temporarily.

179
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
And Coral sounds like the same thing and it certainly seems to be working

180
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
because I tried it out.

181
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
But I don't know if that's really a good solution to the bandwidth

182
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,500
and storage problems that we're looking at with the iPod platform.

183
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Because if it's running through university networks, eventually that's just,

184
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
we're just going to run into a brick wall and we won't be able to

185
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,500
replicate all the work that we probably by, by then will have put into it.

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:50,000
else that's good. Moveable type is, and I posted this on my web blog and on the, on the, on

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the, I think I put it on iPodder.org as well. Moveable type, there's now a plugin available

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that will allow you to add enclosures to your blog post. So it also spits out an

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
RSS 2.0 with enclosures syndicated feed. And there's a couple links around them.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's also one of my weblog live.curry.com where you can check it out. I don't use

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Moveable type. I never have. I have no idea how well the plugin works, but just want

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to make sure everyone's aware of it. And more on the iPodder dev list. Yeah, so some

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
folks are starting. Oh, wow. Listen to this bird for a second. Hold on.

194
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Just walk out.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Of course now that I'm outside you immediately stop singing come on

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There he is here.

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He's in this tree here.

198
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's see him.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay, enough nature intermezzo. Back to work.

200
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We're talking about talking about

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Now is it going all these keeps going off so yeah, so on the iPod of dev list where a lot of people

202
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
publishing. So that's good. And I think we're pretty close to really being able to focus on that.

203
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And I'm, you know, we're just going to have to continue the conversation and figure out what we

204
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,500
think is the is the best way to do this. And I'm feeling that some people are going to come up with

205
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
some really interesting angles to how we can make this as easy as possible for everybody. And it

206
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
also appears that screen scraping is out. It's like everyone has said, Hey, you know, okay,

207
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
not such a good idea. And that's kind of dying off. And there's some some talk about, you

208
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
know, what's the best way to, you know, to keep this development group going? I personally

209
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
really like the Yahoo! list because it has an RSS feed you can subscribe to it, you know, email

210
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:15,500
notifications, it's free. And you know, the only other alternative I've heard so far is a wiki.

211
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,500
And I don't, you know, I understand what they do, but I just don't get wikis. It's,

212
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,500
it would be too difficult for me. And now of course, I'm going to a lot of wiki people saying

213
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,500
check this out. But it has probably just wasted breath on me, you know, you know,

214
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
how you get attached to one one type of application or one type of car or one type of woman.

215
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Alright, let's see, why don't we play a song? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now it's kind of, I was

216
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
going to, because it was, you know, it's a really rainy day and it's cloudy and it's

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
just, it's not really nice. I was thinking I was going to play something nice and rough

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and now I hear this bird singing so beautifully. I almost don't feel right about playing

219
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
this but we need to kind of wake up for this Monday. That was Cooper here. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

220
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I got no friends, got no readin' papers, I'm back in this theater room.

221
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
And the past is gone

222
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Mr. Nice Guy on the source code.

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No final bit of drums there.

224
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's see, just two quick things I wanted to play for you here that I picked up, even though I was really busy in the past couple days.

225
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is probably the shortest podcast ever from Raster Web Audio, and it's just so silly that it's only 13 seconds.

226
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I think you'll enjoy it.

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
This is Raster Web Jokeo for whatever day it is.

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The guy walks into a pole and says,

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Ow! Hey, didn't there used to be a bar here?

230
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Who put this pole here?

231
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Thank you, goodnight.

232
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll be here all week.

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I caught the second session of Live from the Formosa Tea House.

234
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It came in, they have an RSS 2.0 feed, lovely, and it came in automatically.

235
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And these guys are getting pretty good because I was really jealous that when I heard the beginning of the show,

236
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
listen to this, they've got it really sounding very professional. Check it out.

237
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Live from the Formosa Tea House.

238
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Wow, from the foremost e-house.

239
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh man, that's so cool. I got a whole jingle going on.

240
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Now I gotta get a couple of those set up.

241
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Wait a minute, maybe I can... hold on.

242
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
When I was working at Z100 in New York,

243
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
they had a top of the hour jingle that went,

244
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
serving the universe from the top of the Empire State Building.

245
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Maybe we can do this.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
podcasting across the universe almost let's try it with reverb instead of with echo I'll be better

247
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
podcasting across the universe

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
podcasting across the universe it's the source code code code

249
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
cool

250
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
All right enough playing around for today. I'm gonna wrap things up and I'm gonna hopefully Dave and I'll

251
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
this week. I'm going to be pretty much home all week except for Wednesday in the afternoon.

252
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to Rotterdam. I've been scheduled to

253
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
a speech for some company, a paid gig, you know, so I actually got to concentrate on that Tuesday and figure out.

254
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
people.

255
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
As always if you want to respond send me an email.

256
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
