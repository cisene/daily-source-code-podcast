00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hi everybody, it's the Source Code and today is September 7th, 2004.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm Adam Curry and good evening or good morning or good afternoon wherever you're listening

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to the Source Code.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thanks for downloading, thanks for subscribing.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Welcome to you today or this evening I should say from the bunker in Amsterdam.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's the house that we've had in the middle of the city for the past four years.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We call it the bunker because it used to be a museum and it's completely fortified.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's got alarm systems up the yin yang, double enforced doors, bulletproof glass, all this

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
crap.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And Patricia and I are staying here tonight.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's 10 minutes to 10 p.m. so a little bit late with the show because wow, had a very busy day.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We got up, let's see.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I got up at six o'clock, which is still my time to rise, apparently.

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I still haven't gotten out of the morning show rhythm, I guess.

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I was going to say algorithm.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
I haven't gotten out of the morning show rhythm yet.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And at 6.30 we have to get up to get Christina off to school properly anyway.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,500
And we had to drive for about an hour and 15 minutes to Grandmaster View today, which is

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
a flat-screen company that I own a share in.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
I've been around since it's half inception.

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,500
And it's actually, you should check it out, grandmasterview.com.

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
And it should be coming to the States pretty soon.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,500
We're already in Germany, in Spain, in Italy, and of course the Netherlands and Belgium.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Really huge flat screens.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
I'm talking like, what do we have?

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Two, I see the largest.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
stock model we make is two meters and 25 centimeters diagonally.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So that's, what is that?

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's about seven feet.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So these are pretty big.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And so just, you know, I try to get up there once a week

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and hang out with everyone.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Basically, you know, production is running.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So it's all marketing.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I am part of the whole marketing scheme.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Everyone knows in Holland, Adam Curry,

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
helicopters and flat screens.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And after that, we went off to one of our partners.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And Patricia, by the way, had never been up to Grand Master View.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So it was really nice to show her that and I had a quick meeting.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then we went 15 minutes further up to Kuehlenburg,

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
which is just around Utrecht in the middle of the Netherlands,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to a company called Design Concepts,

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the one of our partners with Grand Master View.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What they do is they do these really beautiful frames

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
around our flat screens and do them in leather

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and different types of material.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And they have a showroom where they're selling their furniture.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And they have...

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
at least five different setups where they have the living room setups.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Only now they have it in addition to a beautiful living room.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,500
They also have one of our screens custom designed to fit that particular style.

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
So Patricia and I checked that out and I think we probably bought a couch or something.

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm not sure.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
She saw something she liked a lot, but it was really cool.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
And I think that's a great way to combine two different products.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
And it's working because we actually have one of our salespeople sitting there in

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
the in the design concept store.

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
You can check out design concepts at design concepts dot NL.

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
So let's see that got us back.

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
No, after that, then I had to go off to see the accountants for our quarterly sit down.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Most of you are rolling your eyes and going, you know, accountants, tax lawyers,

63
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
whatever, I actually enjoy it.

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
There's nothing better than having your accountants and your lawyers and your

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
tax lawyers all at the table and knowing that each one of those guys

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
is charging you three to four hundred dollars an hour.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
So I just make the.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
best of it. I make sure I get plenty of all the tea I want and I make jokes and we have

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
a pretty good time. I don't mind it. They're supposed to be saving me and helping me and

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
usually they do. At least I think I've found a team that's pretty damn good. And that

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
took obviously took quite a while and then by the time I got home it was time for Patricia

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and I to go grab a bite to eat and then of course I passed out on the couch. I

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
think Patricia might have passed out as well. We both kind of a woke around 9

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
o'clock this evening I said well guess what you know I want to go record the

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
source source code and I hadn't had a chance to crack my computer all day

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
since we left the house. Man I hate that so much you know there's so much email

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that's come in that I just can't even start to look at right now I'm just too

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
tired to do it. There's all kinds of things that need my attention and

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that's oh man. And of course I don't even know if there's more any audio

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
stuff that's come down the pipe. Luckily tomorrow we're driving home. I'll have a

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
chance to catch up on any program.

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
that I may have missed.

83
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Let's see, so I do want to talk a little bit about...

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Let's see about iPodder. I had a couple of updates there.

85
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
What did I have? Oh yeah.

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Looks like we have two new versions coming up,

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
and tomorrow I'll know for sure,

88
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
and by tomorrow night I'll have updated ipodder.org.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I saw on my email just a brief scan that there is now a Java version of iPodder,

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
and there's also a Coco version,

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,500
which is I believe the Mac OS X native scripting or programming environment.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm not too sure, but I will be checking out both of those programs

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
and putting them up in the directory as appropriate.

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
If you know of any feeds, please let me know,

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,500
because I'd love to add something to the MP3 RSS directory feed,

96
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,500
so people can subscribe to that with their MP3 devices.

97
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Also got some feedback on using the metadata,

98
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
which is a big word for all the information you're stuffing.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
to a file that you send along. Basically, that's the stuff that when you play the source code

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
on your MP3 player or in iTunes or whatever you're playing it on, that's why it actually,

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
instead of just giving you a file name, it says source code, Adam Curry, and then it

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
may have a date. It may show you a genre which should be speech track one of one.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And then maybe like the past two or three shows, I've actually put a subtitle for

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the show in there. And so that should run across your display of your MP3 player.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And on the iPod specifically, I started off with the title is source code and then

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the date and I spell it full out. So it's source code September 7th 2004.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Apparently when you're in the playlist menu and you're browsing through

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
different shows, you only really get up to like half of the name of the month.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it's source code August or source code September.

110
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Clearly not handy when searching for a particular title.

111
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
So I got to figure out what I'm going to do to change this.

112
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I don't know if I want to put the date first and make it a seemingly easier to parse date.

113
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,500
So for today, should it be 09072004, source code?

114
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Or I don't know.

115
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,500
But clearly the way I'm doing it is not making it very easy to archive and browse in iPod

116
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
and playlists.

117
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
So duly noted, let's see who did I get this email from.

118
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
This was from Paul Pilots.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
And I will definitely work on some kind of naming convention that works a little bit better

120
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
on the iPod and I guess presumably on other MP3 devices.

121
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,500
And please, if you're subscribing to the source code and you have iPod are running through

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Windows Media Player on any other device other than the iPod, please let me know.

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,500
I'd love to know people using it that way as well because the reason I'm sitting here at

124
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
5 to 10 in the evening.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
because I'm getting a lot of feedback and I'm getting a lot of people are

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
listening to the source code also

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, you know, it seems like stuff's working.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, now I had promised you something yesterday,

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
which I'm now going to bring up.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a real clip.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So I'm mixing all different kinds of media here today.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I remember I told you, I was discussing,

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was discussing, oh, the big DJ voice.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think it was where, you know,

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
DJs always have to talk really loud

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and have to really enunciate everything

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and they're hitting on it, punch and make it sound

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
like you're hitting home when you're talking to that listener.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, a lot of people do this.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And a lot of people record their shows,

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
pre-record their shows.

142
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'd like to do it direct to tape

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
or direct to MP3, as it were in this case.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Casey Kasem, we've probably heard used,

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I guess, I don't know if he still does the American

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
top 30 countdown, what is it?

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The American or the Casey Kasem's top 40.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He probably still does that show, it's syndicated.

149
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,500
around the country actually around the globe I've heard it all over the place so at a certain point in the show

150
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
He does something called the long-distance dedication and it's someone

151
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,500
You know who lives in one part of the world or one part of the states and have a song played and dedicated to someone else

152
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,500
And there's always a story behind it's a little bit sappy in fact the whole show KC Kasem show is so sappy and is so

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Well, so it's so early 80s

154
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
well at one point

155
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,500
You hear the real Casey Kasem as I'm I'm confident I've only met a couple times

156
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
But I'm confident this is exactly the way he can be if he's extremely pissed off

157
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Certainly at the height of his Casey Kasem days when people would run around do anything for him because he was

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Mr. Casey Kasem, Mr. Countdown on the radio

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Check it out this little bit where Casey Kasem told hi. This is Casey Kasem

160
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
American top 40 has moved to a new time

161
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning at every Saturday morning at 2 to

162
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Okay, so there you go American top 40

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now listen to the dedication and listen to Casey lose it on this one.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Now we're up to our long-distance dedication.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Whether we have kids or pets or neither.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And here's what he writes.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and it'll meet a lot if you play it.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Recently there was a death in our family.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of...

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's come start again.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm coming out of the record.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Play the record, okay?

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Please.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
See when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers man, it's impossible to make those transitions

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And then you got to go into somebody dying. You know they do this to me all the time

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't know what the hell they do it for but goddamn it if we can't come out of a slow record

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't understand it is down on the phone

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo record every time

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I do a goddamn death dedication

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a god last goddamn time

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I want somebody uses fucking brain to not come out of a goddamn record

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That is that's up tempo and I got to talk about a fucking dog dying. Well, he's a fucking ponderous man

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ponderous fucking ponderous

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ponderous

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And don't we all feel like that once in a while there's a yelling everybody and boy does it sound good when you yell at someone and

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You've got that compressed mic sound you've got the headphones on you can hear your voice really well and just go yell about your

191
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
fucking dead dog dedication. Perfect radio history moment.

192
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Now let me take you right into a song because it's our song of the day I felt like playing

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,500
something by the motel so sit back and enjoy. Only the lonely.

194
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:32,500
We walked. The loneliest man. We smiled. Without any style. We kissed, fought, together, wrong.

195
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
No intention.

196
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
We laughed.

197
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:48,500
About each other's strengths. We lived. Without each other. Thank you what everyone would do.

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Without me and you.

199
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:00,500
It's like I told you. Only the lonely gets laid.

200
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
So dark.

201
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Here we go.

202
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
So dark.

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
To nothing we know, our feelings go lowing

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Way up steaming

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You better, the time we were together

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So long ago, with that girl, remember all I know

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is it makes me feel good now

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's like a song you, all the way below you can't play

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All the way below you, all the way below you can't play

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So long ago, with that girl, remember all I know

211
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Only the lonely, only the lonely can be

212
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
You're early 80s, huh?

213
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,500
The motels, only this summer on your daily source code live from Amsterdam, coming to

214
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
you from the bunker on the Emperor's Canal.

215
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I'm going to leave you with one final thought.

216
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
As I said today was going to be rather short just because it was so hectic and so much

217
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,500
to do and I haven't really had a chance to even look at my aggregator really barely.

218
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I was reading a Q&A with Bill Gates.

219
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
I think Dave Weiner pointed to it.

220
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,500
And at one point, and it's obviously talking about competing devices with the iPod

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,500
and with iTunes and their competing service with the service that will

222
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
compete against the iTunes music store.

223
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
And here's the quote that Bill Gates gave says,

224
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,500
but the work we've done with these device manufacturers to get them to build

225
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
support for subscription music in.

226
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
That's a big contribution.

227
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
It's kind of a weird sentence, but basically what he's saying that with Windows Media Player.

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The work that Microsoft has done to get them to build in support for subscription music has been a big contribution.

229
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm thinking, you know, subscription, this is exactly the stuff we're doing.

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is real subscription stuff.

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know, you can always build in a money channel if you need to, but you know, why is it all music that we're talking about?

232
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Stop focusing just on music.

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
These things can be used for a hell of a lot more than just music.

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Pure transfer of information, data, you know, just like the source code.

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But it is good that they've got that subscription all built in.

236
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Anyway, that's it for the source code for today.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm going to hit the hay tomorrow's reasonably easy day for me.

238
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We have a production company coming to take a look if they actually would like to rent this place for several months

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to do a Dutch version of, I think it's the Apprentice.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, that would be nice if we could rent this place out.

241
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And pretty soon we're going to be looking for new digs in the UK.

242
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So I'll keep you up to speed on that when we meet again tomorrow.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
On the source code.

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Take care everybody.

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The power.

246
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:16,500
And of course, if you want to respond, send email to adamantcurry.com or leave a comment

247
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
on my weblog, live.

248
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:29,500
The power of your intelligence.
