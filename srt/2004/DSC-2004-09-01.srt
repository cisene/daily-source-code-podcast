1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm not gonna have to do it in the evening, good morning, wherever you happen to be listening to this more rather than the source code.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's go to the list.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
home as a framist of my web world. Even though it's been really crazy.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to record a source code. And in this case, I'm joined by a guest, although he'll only

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
be a minor participant in the story. His name is Taxi Eric. He's my regular wheelman.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And besides being good buddy, he's also kind of like a gypsy ring, wherever I'm stuck.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Whatever problem I'm in, I give McCall and he'll come and bail me out if necessary.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So let me just explain what...

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
from the car right now we're doing about what are we doing Eric 150 kilometers now we're coming

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
from the northern part of the Netherlands in the province of Croningen which is near the city of

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Croningen which is a big college town and what else they do there yeah they suck natural gas out

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of mother earth that's what they do in Croningen and it's quite a drive from my house it's actually

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
yeah oh boy what is 175 miles and I drove halfway up to

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, how are we going?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I go home and drive over.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He jumped in my car, left his cab waiting with the meter running.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
With the meter running.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because I had some business to do today as you probably remember.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, there was my last morning radio show for Radio Veronica.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It was crazy.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
a lot of driving in between.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And today is the start of my new life, new life day one,

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
everybody.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And that means that we're starting to wind things down

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and get things prepared for our move, our pending move

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to the UK.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So the good news is there's the House of Belgium

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is sold.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That happened just last week.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So we're all pretty pumped about that.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So now we're going to start looking for something in the UK,

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
probably in the Surrey or Kent region, which is South of London.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And so one of the things I promised myself, let's see,

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
about four years ago, I noticed in Amsterdam

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
that the trauma helicopters, which are here, they're yellow,

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which some bad happens.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're going to be real happy to see one of these guys

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to pick up and take you to the hospital.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That they were operating in a very difficult rooftop situation

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
on top of the hospital.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And that they were actually doing all the servicing

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and their fueling at Svipol Airport, which

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
are equivalent of JFK or any major league airport.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a really big hub for...

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
for the rest of Europe.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Which is very costly because it doesn't matter if you're a trauma helicopter or your

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
to pay the same amount of money.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
about I think two hundred.

49
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
they can carry more people in the...

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
said, hey, that's not not right.

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
And being in the aviation myself, I said, well, why don't we get a heliport where they

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
can land nearby and we'll operate that.

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,500
We'll let these guys fuel up and we'll make it $40 instead of $200.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Now you have to know that the Netherlands doesn't have a large aviation history when it comes

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
to local aviation.

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
And it was very difficult.

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Many people have tried to get a heliport known as ever succeeded.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,500
It took me almost four years of going through city councils, different versions of them,

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
you know, people leave after a while.

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
And finally I got all the paperwork.

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,500
self-appartner, Helle Holland, which is probably the only real helicopter coming to talk to.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And they'll start exploring the heliport probably before the end of this year.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So they've been to visit me several times their main offices.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
It's all done with fitting that for this particular case nightclub see their facility

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
and hang out.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,500
7.25 pm, by the way, this is Monday, September 1st.

67
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
And we're on our way back.

68
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Eric is going to drop me off around the middle of the Netherlands in Aden.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Wednesday today. What did I say? Monday. Okay, so maybe I should not smoke any more this joint.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, it's Wednesday, September 1st. Thank you very much.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So just briefly about the radio show yesterday because it was kind of fun and I posted a link,

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
certainly NSFW to what happened during the last show, the management. No, not my colleagues,

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but the actual management of the station felt that after a year because it was just a year that I promised

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to do the show of basically being silly and giggling about women all morning long, it was time to send

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
me a really good stripper and that was jeweled parrots. What do you think? She was very good looking.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So and despite the fact that it was radio, it kind of worked. She came in as she said,

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
she was the cleaner and then oh boy, it's warm in here. I never seen a cleaner with high white

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
boots though. That was kind of a giveaway.

79
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I want to talk to you about a couple other things.

80
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
There's so much that I need to discuss, but I just haven't had the time.

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
There's so many different audio bits I want to let you listen to.

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I've been picking up blog posts.

83
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I've been picking up people who are starting to enclose their posts in RS2.0 feeds within

84
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
closures.

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I got a beautiful long email from Dave Slusher from evilgeniuskronicles.org, which I really haven't

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
had a chance to parse properly.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
But it was definitely a hey neighbor.

88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
How you doing?

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Why don't we get acquainted note?

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I'm really happy about that.

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Because this is source code where users and developers party together.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
That's my entire mission.

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And currently we're working on the iPod platform.

94
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Anyone I don't know if Dave Slusher is a user or a developer, and I think it's fine to be

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
both.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
way heavier on one side or the other. I'm trying to beef up my developer or I guess

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
system integration competency so I can do more modeling and developing and prototyping

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
of what I want my computer to do and the different bits that are already in there that we

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
just need to connect to each other. So the iPod platform which we've been talking about

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
for quite a while is picked up some steam rather quickly thanks to an article from the

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
inquire inquire not the inquire but the inquire which is publication owned by the register.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And the piece was written I don't have it with me actually here but it was written by

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Doug Moni and it was it was a title of the piece it was great MP3 fodder with iPodder

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and it was a very very flattering piece basically saying hey here's something new and I think

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
what Doug did was really important he put into plain well written English words.

106
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
what we're trying to achieve with this and I've pointed to it on my web blog.

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Please check it out so you can find the link at live.curry.com

108
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,500
and you can see if you're not quite sure what we're talking about here or

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,500
where this should go, Doug explains it perfectly.

110
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,500
And I do know Doug from many years ago

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,500
and only opportunity to let you know about that now

112
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
since he's writing about me. There's some history between us

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,500
because back in 1983 I was working at

114
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm sorry, not A3, 93, 92, 93. I was working at MTV

115
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
had already been doing a lot of online stuff with America online.

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Then before then it was what was it? It was Vienna,

117
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Vienna online or Quanto. Anyways, all the online services had finally gotten myself

118
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
in Panics.net in New York was distributing my,

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
what I then called, cyberslees, which was kind of gossip news

120
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
through my .pland file, which meant you had to finger

121
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,500
my Panics account and upper pop the day's news

122
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
in the form of a .pland file.

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
This was before Web, but in fact we only had something

124
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,500
called Go for them, which is very much hyperlinked

125
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
like Structron, it was all text based,

126
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
and basically worked best on a Unix terminal

127
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
with your arrow keys to follow a link to the next server,

128
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
but it certainly was nothing quite like

129
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
the worldwide web that we know today.

130
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
And so I got in trouble, apparently,

131
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,500
that was my first experience with terms of use

132
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
and Panics shut me off, you know,

133
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
and like, who did I think I was?

134
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Of course I was this commercial dude trying to turn the internet

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
into a,

136
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,500
and no more access for you, and certainly not for doing this kind of stuff, because it

137
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
overtaxed their servers.

138
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:51,500
And then I keep quite remember how I met the guys at digx.net, which were in Reston, Virginia.

139
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I think it was Reston.

140
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
It was in Virginia, definitely.

141
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Bolt or more, oh shit, well, Doug will kill me that I don't, and there's two dogs who will kill me that I don't know, and RS as well, and several people.

142
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Because these guys were just a bunch of, really a bunch of data...

143
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
If you are a bokeh, you are a bokeh.

144
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Ah, okay, that's...

145
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
um...

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
it's starting out to be pretty strange show

147
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
uh... so anyway we got into it i think i saw an ad for the uh... somewhere that

148
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
you could uh... buy a uh... server space

149
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
for tea i think it was uh...

150
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:45,500
it was. And so I got a sun three card with maybe it was 40 or 50 megs of this space at

151
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,500
the time. Just go crazy on and that's actually when we registered MTV.com. They said,

152
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,500
you know, you can have an IP address or you could register it to something.

153
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
That's, I don't think that's that important anymore, but at the time,

154
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
certainly for brand like MTV, you know.

155
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
too and of course that was all done.

156
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
That's why I hooked up with DJX and these guys were there along along

157
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,500
And Doug, I think, I don't believe he was there in the beginning and he was already doing

158
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
PR stuff.

159
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
But these guys were a hoot.

160
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
They were originally boogah, boogah.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
they are that they, um,

162
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Florida outfit, man, I'm horrible at this.

163
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Anyway, I think they all did okay,

164
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
didn't they made some money and we all like each other still.

165
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
So it was nice that the duck picked up on that,

166
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
but he's always been falling what I've been doing

167
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
so that it's really...

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And tomorrow we have a photo shoot.

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My wife is doing a photo shoot at the castle,

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but I'm going to be home all day, which will be nice.

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I get to sleep in a little bit, which I try to do this morning,

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
but still a work at six.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Still in the rhythm of the 330 wake up call.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I'll be able to do some proper preparations on the source

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
code, because there's so much happening,

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and there's so many ideas.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it was great to hear the duck K of IT conversations

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:44,500
platform thing and I'm now getting more questions from people like Taxi Eric. I just want to plug in their MP3 device. I don't know when iPod is my dumb

179
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
something that she plays music on and she hooks it up to the computer and I said,

180
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
well, you know, I explained that now we could make it so you just hook it up to

181
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
the computer for it to charge and we pick up in the morning you've got all your

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,500
new shows. Which would be what shows would you like to hear Eric if you had to

183
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,500
listen to anything and it could be produced anywhere it could be anything you

184
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
wanted or kind of...

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do me music or just also anything you want if you want to be talk or music or in the morning

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to have some information I want to hear some news about last night. I want to have some news

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to happen today and I want to know something about the traffic, I want to know something

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
about the weather.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What kind of things, you know?

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So, that's really, you can hear now immediately how community-based a radio show is.

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He really wants to know what's going on in his world and he's a cab driver, so what does

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
he want to do?

193
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
like it's that simple.

194
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
You just have to find your community.

195
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
It's just like web logs.

196
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Only it does.

197
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
learning curve, but maybe not even.

198
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
If you look at a lot of weblog software,

199
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
there's sometimes there's a learning curve

200
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
you're for that.

201
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
And with audio blogging, it'll be the same.

202
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
And I'm definitely going to delve back into what kind

203
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
of software we need to do this kind of audio blogging

204
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,500
on the desktop, which has infinitely more capabilities

205
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
and possibilities right now for what you can do with audio

206
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
versus an audio blogging service where you call up

207
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
the phone or where you drop a, you know,

208
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
where it takes over your your internal microphone

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
and records it for you.

210
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
There's a lot to be said for that.

211
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
But the feature said that you can do on the desktop

212
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
is infinitely more rich, I think.

213
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
All right, quick break now because I got a couple more things

214
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
to say after I'm done.

215
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
This is something I picked up.

216
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
um, the came from and see what feed it is.

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the blog digger.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
from their NP3 feeds.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll link to the original source from this, although it was kind of funny how they start

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
off and start ragging on the fact that you're not doubtful on to get from the original source

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
but you're hearing it somewhere.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's a nice, it's a fine tune that I like because it speaks to both sides of our party

223
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
to the users and the developers.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Check out every OS sucks.

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, hi there.

226
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you for downloading another fine quality comedy product from 3Dedrals and a Peggy

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and your friends at MP3.com.

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Good for you.

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Of course, if you've downloaded this from Napster, screw you.

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You know what, free isn't good enough for you?

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You gotta rip us off.

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's okay.

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I will find you and I will kill you.

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You see, I come from a time in the 1970s when computers were used for two things.

236
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,500
play pong. Nothing in between, you see. You didn't need a fancy operating system to play

237
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,500
pong, and the men who went to the Moon God bless him did it with no mouse, and a plain text

238
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,500
only black and white screen and 32 kilobytes of brown. But then around both the late 70s

239
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,500
home computers started to do a little more than play pong. Very little horn.

240
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Why computer started to play games? Balance checkbooks? Why you could play a saxon on your Apple

241
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,500
2 or write a book all with a computer that had 32 kilobytes of RAM. Was enough to go to the Moon?

242
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,500
It was enough for you. It was a golden time. A time before windows. A time before mouses. A time

243
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:31,500
before the internet and bloatware and a time before every OS sucked.

244
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh man.

245
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the olden times make them.

246
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'd laugh and play all night and day on Sork 1, 2 and 3.

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Amiga Vic 20 in the Sinclair 2, the TRS 80 and the Apple 2.

248
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,500
it was a much, but it was enough. But then Xerox made a prototype. Steve Jobs came on the scene,

249
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
red of mice and menus, windows, icons, a trash and a bit...

250
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
TV said to Xerox, boys turn your heads and cough.

251
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,500
When no one was looking to rip their interfaces up, stole every feature they had seen put

252
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
it in a cute box with a tiny little screen.

253
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Mac OS 1 ran that machine, only cost 5,000 bucks.

254
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,500
But it was slow, it was buggy, so they wrote it again, and now they're up to OS 10, they'll

255
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
charge it for the base...

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Every OS waste your time, you're the best top to the lap.

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Everything since Apple does, just a bunch of crap.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
From Microsoft and Macintosh to LinLine and Linux.

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Every computer crashes, because every OS sucks.

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well then Microsoft jumped in the game, copied Apple's interface with an OS named Windows.

261
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,500
rose and rose. Then Windows 95, then 98, man, solitaire never ran so great and every single

262
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,500
version came out late, but I guess that's the way it goes. But that bloatware will crash

263
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
and delete your work in TME, man. None of them work, but gates may be Richard and Captain

264
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Kirk. But the Windows OS blows and sucks at that same time. I've treated in here right for

265
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:30,500
what? It's top of the line from the CompuHut, the fridge stove and toaster, never crash on

266
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,500
me. I should be able to get on live without a Ph.D. My phone doesn't take a week to

267
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,500
glue it, but TV doesn't crash when I'm muted. A mishasket text in my floppy drive, I wish

268
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,500
that it was still alive. But it ain't the hardware, man. It's just that every OS.

269
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Now there's Lennox or Lennox, I don't know how you say it or how you install it or use it or play it or

270
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,500
where you download it or what programs run, but Lennox or Lennox don't...

271
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Before you say it, it's getting great press though, how it survives if anyone's gas

272
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,500
in me asked me to great big mess for a leotist nerdy schmucks.

273
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,500
It's free they say if you can get it to run, the geek say hey, that's half the fun yeah,

274
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
but I got a girlfriend and things to get done.

275
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
The Linux OS sucks.

276
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm sorry to say it, but it dies.

277
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Every OS waste your time from the desktop to the laptop.

278
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Everything since the abacus, just a bunch of crap.

279
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Cause every OS sucks, every computer crashes it

280
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Cause every OS...

281
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
beautiful every OS sucks and that drives right to the heart of what we're talking about

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's something that both users and developers know but explain both from a different vantage point

283
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
users know that every OS sucks because

284
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Every OS crashes even XP. Oh even OS 10 something always will suck eventually

285
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Every developer knows that every OS sucks because well they deal with it every single day

286
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And there's always bits that suck in there and something I've heard Dave went what Dave Winer say

287
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
probably read him say hey

288
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That all software sucks all software is buggy and it's absolutely true now that I've been putting my own stuff together

289
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I know what the mistakes are in in iPodder. I know what's wrong

290
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I know it should be working differently and until you really dig into the code you won't know

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But you'll encounter it you'll find say hey that's strange. Why's it doing that?

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It may not come back. He might trip over it something might replicate but there's bugs in there

293
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Shit, we were just booting up the in-cart navigation. I might Audi A8

294
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
But you think I paid enough fucking mula for it to

295
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
For it all work the same thing is just it was rebooting and then finally caught and everything worked

296
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,500
So I'm gonna wind up a source code for today. Just one do a little plug for taxi Eric because

297
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Well, that's part of how this kind of stuff works

298
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,500
You know, we've got a little individual part of deals happening. I'm getting a discount on this ride right baby

299
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
So if you're if you ever come to Amsterdam and you need

300
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Someone to wheel you around town at a good price and comfortable car. He's got a Mercedes

301
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
CD elegance okay, 800 the from the elegant series

302
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
And he's very clean and very he's very sweet boy

303
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
But actually

304
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Just fun to just talk about taxes for a second in Amsterdam

305
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Many many years ago there was basically a monopoly the taxi you get a correct correct me if I'm wrong

306
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Eric on this the TCA the the taxi central

307
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm so they they basically had all the medallions and

308
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You couldn't really compete with them, but there were some guys

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Because you had to buy a medallion because what a medallion cost back the day

310
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
These days was 100,000

311
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Guilders for only one-third of but one-third of a medallion so three guys

312
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Together would pay 300,000 guilders at the time was about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars

313
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, so for one medallion to be split up by three guys

314
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So you could do that you could because the monopoly

315
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And but of course it was

316
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And they had the radio transmitting system and could dispatch cars etc and

317
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So some guys said you know screw it will just be independence and you could they could wait by a could you wait by a phone?

318
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
By a call phone or you had your own clients or own clients mobile phone

319
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Telephone everything you know, okay and

320
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,500
But that of course took a major investment on these guys' part, you know,

321
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,500
going with about 40 or 50 thousand dollars, basically by your one-third mind you of a medallion.

322
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,500
So these cars, of course, were... it would always be on one car. Eric? No, it could just be three cars.

323
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,500
It was three guys, so it was all the way 24 hours a day. Okay, so then yeah, three guys running on

324
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:24,500
one medallion. So we had little micro pockets that started to pop up. And what really,

325
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,500
boom for these guys was really the introduction of GSM mobile telephony. Because now you had

326
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,500
these groups of guys who each had their own customers, you know, once you wind up with someone,

327
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
they hand you a business card and hey, can I call you again here? It's my cell phone number,

328
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,500
call me. And they started connecting these networks together. So if you're in a town like Amsterdam

329
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,500
and you know, you don't just know your two other colleagues on the medallion, you know, maybe 50

330
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,500
guys and all kinds of other groups. So what they do is if they could...

331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
make a client run themselves they call up one of their buddies uh... because

332
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
you know that's not just spoke to uh... to keep

333
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and people's over its triple airport so maybe he's done all call him up so

334
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
they have this all mapped out in their head and they have all these

335
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
really appreciate it when you see it and the phone calls just keep flying all the time.

336
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,500
And he calls someone else and he pick it up and then they'd hook him up later on.

337
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
So it was a total barter system.

338
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,500
And some guys got a little bit smarter and we're charged guys to give them work.

339
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
So that kind of coupled along for a while.

340
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
But then the city of Amsterdam did something very interesting.

341
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
And this day don't know why.

342
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
They said, you know what, we're going to change the rules.

343
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
No longer is there a limited amount of medallions.

344
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
We can start a taxi company.

345
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,500
All you have to do is pass the test.

346
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Well, you could only imagine that this brought in a lot of really bad drivers.

347
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,500
What?

348
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Bad cars also.

349
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Everything, bad drivers, bad cars.

350
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
They didn't know the way.

351
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
They didn't know how to speak.

352
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
They didn't know how to open the door, open the truck.

353
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
What's just shit?

354
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Now besides that, you had a whole bunch of guys sitting around who would invest at $50,000.

355
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,500
And you know, within the day before two, a couple of years before, who were going to...

356
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
pay that off probably for the rest of their professional career just as a part of the

357
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
cost of doing. And these guys, yeah they got fucked basically.

358
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So if you're lucky you can still get for the same, but you did pay 40,000 euros, I say

359
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
you're rose. Yeah. Now maybe you get, if you're lucky you get two, maybe two and a half

360
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
tasks. For that same medallion. For the same number.

361
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay, so, and that really stirred up a whole bunch of shit in the cab world. And so now

362
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
the free, actually I think, although it sounds really shitty, I think it's, I think it's

363
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
actually very good because the free market at work, you see what's happening. You see

364
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the people who have hooked up with someone that they like and they appreciate and they're

365
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
willing to pay for a courtesy and service and a clean car. Now they pay a little bit more

366
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and they, and they get a really good deal.

367
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
to our, uh, yeah.

368
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
again it's not just for a cat.

369
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
yeah i'm gonna drive away as fast as possible

370
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
all right so if you're coming to Amsterdam

371
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
let me know send me an email out of it career dot com

372
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
all the up with the taxi Eric

373
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
this is the source code we still have, what do we have?

374
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,500
But we've got 45 minutes until we hit, until we hit Hillversome.

375
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
You know what we'll do?

376
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
We'll try and upload this at a hotspot at a Wi-Fi point.

377
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
We get to Hillversome, so we can get it up to the server then.

378
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,500
And then by the time I get home, I already have responses to it.

379
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
It's a wonderful thing.

380
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,500
And tomorrow, of course, we'll go in depth a little bit more about the iPod platform and

381
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,500
the latest updates and recent happenings around iPodder.

382
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
And hopefully some more cool bits from stuff that we've been thinking up around the

383
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
net because we are definitely making some stuff happen here.

384
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Until then, I'm Adam Curry.

385
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
If again, if you want to react, Adam and Curry.

386
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh my God
