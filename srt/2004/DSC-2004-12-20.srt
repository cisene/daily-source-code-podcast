1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,160
Look, here in real life.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,660
Take off and leave.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,040
There aren't many people going in jail.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,700
grup

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:27,460
O

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:45,300
Hey everybody welcome it's the daily source code coming to you from Utrecht you might

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:53,740
say Utrecht in the Netherlands in the low countries this is the podcast from the hotel room

8
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:02,420
on the left-hand side of the bed which of course is where the power out but it's completely

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,460
located alright everybody let's kick it off with some really really really good news my

10
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:18,580
mom had her operation today they removed her entire lung but she was already off of the

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:26,260
breathing apparatus when she was in intensive care breathing on her own and obviously totally

12
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:32,100
out of it but doctors say everything went great could not be happy

13
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,140
I want to thank everybody for all the beautiful thoughts prayers, emails, voice messages,

14
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,460
audio comments, everything all the great thoughts that you've been sending along this is

15
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,860
obviously just to be the beginning of a journey from my mom and for her friends and obviously for the

16
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:03,300
family but we're off to a running start let's put it that way so I'll be in and out of the hospital

17
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,300
for the next couple of days I chose this hotel because it's very near to the hospital so it's not

18
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,300
anywhere really near I'm saying well it's about 20 minute car ride if if you wanted to do it

19
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:25,140
but it was great because I was looking for a hotel in Utrecht that was you know a nice hotel

20
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,420
this is a word that they call us a four star hotel I guess which is whatever and but my criteria

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,700
of course number one top of the list was you know I need Wi-Fi I need really good solid Wi-Fi

22
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,460
and I'd prefer to if it could be a hotel that didn't have the remote control nailed down to the

23
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:53,540
to the cabinet next to the bed stand and this is great the the Wi-Fi is unbelievable of course

24
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,340
as I already posted on my blog you know when it comes to when it comes to me and and connectivity

25
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,020
I mean Jesus Christ and after four weeks of living on a modem this is almost like you know

26
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,020
taking the first talk off of a off of a join after you haven't smoked for four weeks

27
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,140
which of course I can't really talk about anyway so I got this the beautiful little

28
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:23,940
personal access code to log into to the Wi-Fi here and it says here this is I love this card

29
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,700
this is a super fast internet hotel ADSL surfing for a fixed price seven euros 50 a day

30
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:38,420
which well these days is actually a lot of dollars but that's a pretty good price when it comes

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,580
down to a star bug let's see what I paid star bug star box I pay 30 pounds a week which is the equivalent

32
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:55,060
of shoot well that's about forty forty dollars yeah I mean definitely definitely not cheap

33
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,660
so oh by the way thanks to Marcus Mowler for a little bit of the drum cadence the beginning of the

34
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:10,340
show that was his cousin Tim who was in the blue devils back when he was in high school and of course

35
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,300
as you know by now on the on the production show notes as a link to all of that it's it's amazing you

36
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,180
know I've I've really gotten to this drum cadence stuff all of a sudden people sending

37
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,380
me all these different files and some of the stuff is just outrageously good and there's a whole

38
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,900
industry around drum cadence as people selling CDs and DVDs and I'm actually looking for you know

39
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,540
for some for some hit songs being done by by drum bands because that I'm I'm not a lawyer but I'm

40
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,220
pretty sure that as long as you pay your ask at BMI and you have permission to use the actual recording

41
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,580
and it's okay to do it so maybe that's a way to get you know to play some of those memories we've

42
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,940
been talking about more about that by the way later on in the show just a little idea what the setup here

43
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,780
is I couldn't get one a full size queen or king size bid they only have two singles next to each

44
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:14,020
other so one will be for sleeping and one will be for podcasting I've got the power book on my lap

45
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,420
I'm I'm I'm so I'm propped up with pillows behind my my back I'm on the on the bed here

46
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,420
on top of the bed with the laptop I've got the headphones on I brought my breakout box the M audio

47
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:31,940
and I brought the the sure the SMB7 and the stand for this it's a little portable stand that I

48
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:39,060
use at home oh I'm just going to tighten that there my my father-in-law made this he that guy is

49
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,140
looking amazing you you give him like couple of toothpicks and and Scotch tape and some string and

50
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,780
hillbillgia you know a go-kart he's incredibly talented when it comes to making things and he created

51
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,100
this mic I mean and he's always into the stuff that I'm doing right he's a total techno geek he's

52
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,980
he's a musician he's a recording artist he had a recording studio in fact mumbo italyano that

53
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,460
that I've played on the show the song that Patricia did was recorded in soundhouse which was

54
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,540
her dad's studio which he sold many many years ago so he created this mic stand out of a

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,020
a stand that basically holds your music notes and it's perfect it's miniature but I can

56
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,860
extend it with a little tell stop telescopic bit and because it has you know the bass is well if

57
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,060
you know what a music stand looks like you can really extend the bass of the of the stand it's

58
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,860
diameter quite you know quite a way so even though it's just kind of propped on the bed because

59
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,460
the bass is so large now it's just it's there it's not toppling over of course that would be

60
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,380
inviting Murphy in the door here but it's it's pretty good so almost have the identical sound as

61
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,700
as back home back at the cottage where every one of course is having a good time and enjoying the

62
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,660
Christmas shopping but it's going to be interesting the next couple of days because Dave's on the

63
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,580
road Dave Winner he's he has no house he's homeless he's living in hotels I'll be living in hotels

64
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,740
and we'll be in contact and oh god man he had an excellent podcast I listened to on the plane

65
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,060
I'll be talking about that later first I want to bring you some music here on the source code

66
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,620
kind of bending the rules here because it's a mashup you know mashups or smashups or

67
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,860
basically mixes where people are putting two different songs usually one old one new and connecting

68
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,220
together mixing them together you have bands who are doing this live and I got an email here from

69
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,620
Mike Corley obviously it's part of the production show notes and he sends a link to a couple of

70
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,580
MP3s to check out this is the one I thought I'd play for you now because it's it's the time of

71
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:56,180
year it is the season it's Jenny on the block and Paul McCartney Christmas on the block

72
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:28,500
from an incoming movie series to on the set the J load of this high-light clips I stayed grounded

73
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,020
as the amounts were an unreal I thought I told you I'm really wrong that's just me

74
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,900
my thin phone he don't hate on me what you get is what you see

75
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,900
I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I knew I

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,520
I'm still I'm still taking you back

79
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
The heaven and the power held up

I'm gonna be right to another weapon, come on

81
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,420
I don't know what I'm gonna beat now

82
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,920
I think I don't know what I'm gonna beat now

83
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I don't know what they're gonna beat now

84
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,520
It's a bighouse

85
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,160
I think I lie

86
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
I love it

87
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm the perfect age too

88
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,860
I remember when Paul McCartney came out we're the song

89
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,160
and I remember when J railroad this song

90
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,800
Get I at him. This is Cam and Mick from the Good Day World podcast.

91
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,960
Get I at him. Get I world.

92
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
Good day.

93
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
Hey, you're doing it.

94
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,800
Get I at him.

95
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,400
We've been doing this podcasting thing for a couple of weeks.

96
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,160
And my way we think it's a lot of fun.

97
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,920
And we want to give you a shout-out.

98
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
Say thanks very much for all the boring boys.

99
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,640
You don't want to just miss a shout-out.

100
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,480
You want to promote your damn show, right?

101
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,440
Boying boy.

102
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
All the great work you've been doing.

103
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,920
I've been last six months to reinvent this medium.

104
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,880
It's something that's got a big future ahead of it.

105
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,720
We're both sure.

106
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,160
Yeah.

107
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,720
Interesting.

108
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,560
Re-invent this medium.

109
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,160
That was funny.

110
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,120
Because I was just talking to a reporter from Rolling Stone.

111
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
Today, she called me.

112
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,760
And she actually had followed my postings of my web blog.

113
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,840
And she was like, oh, you know, I don't want to bond with your mom

114
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,040
and all that, but I have a deadline.

115
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,800
We were talking about this.

116
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,400
We were talking about just about radio.

117
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,800
You know, how it used to be Murray the K.

118
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,280
And that's before my time.

119
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,400
But I like to say, you know, Murray the K was broadcasting.

120
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,360
And people were listening on their transistor radio.

121
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
It was little portable things with batteries, sound familiar.

122
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,000
And Ahmed Erdogan was, you know, who's the chairman or founder of Atlantic

123
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Records.

124
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
He was selling the shit right out of the back of his car.

125
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,040
You know, we're moving to that space again, people.

126
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,080
It's been good.

127
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,600
So you definitely should get people to come down and check out our podcast.

128
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
Because we want to, the few guys in Australia actually doing this at the moment.

129
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
And we're getting a lot of really good responses to it.

130
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,120
So get your, get your lyrics and let's just come on down.

131
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,440
Check out Get A World GDAY World dot common.

132
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
Hey, Adam, we're running a conference in February, mate.

133
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
A blogging slash podcast in conference.

134
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,600

We would love to have you come down there.

136
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,400
I'd be fantastic.

137
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,360
You know, I did a documentary once on a part of Australia.

138
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,160
There were a couple of people.

139
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
It was like a rough guide.

140
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,280
BBC does these great documentaries.

141
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,040
And it was, it was awesome.

142
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
I had so much fun in Australia.

143
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,360
Started in Sydney when all the way to Perth, you know, stated Cooper

144
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,800
PD, which is, you know, the Opal mines went to the smallest town.

145
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
And all the tourist things, right?

146
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
But also a spinsters and bachelor's ball.

147
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,600
My God, you guys know how to party damp.

148
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Have a bit of a Jeba?

149
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Come and have a drink with the ruin the pub.

150
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,160
It'll be a route where drink with the ruin the pub is a kangaroo.

151
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,880
Right.

152
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,360
We'll throw.

153
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,400
How about the shaylers?

154
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,520
Where the shaylers?

155
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,400
All the shaylers?

156
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,520
You shrimp on the barby fair.

157
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,040
We might even have a t-shirt for you.

158
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
We'll get A World T-shirt.

159
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,320
Yeah, let's go beat up Paul Hook and the kangaroo on it.

160
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,040
Yeah.

161
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,840
So, on you, Adam, thanks for all your hard work, mate.

162
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,880
And we look forward to seeing you on our sunny shores soon.

163
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,600
Right on.

164
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,720
Now, where is matey?

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,440
See you later.

166
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,200
That really would be nice to go to Australia again.

167
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,840
It's so nice.

168
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
It has what to inhaling.

169
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,720
They have something called gazellechide, something is gazellech,

170
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
which the best and the closest translation to that

171
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
in English is coziness.

172
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,480
And so, what I found in Australia is they have the gazellechide of the Dutch.

173
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,680
They still have a lot of English properties to them,

174
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,640
which I like, even though they're the pomeas, right?

175
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,040
Prisoners of Mother England is that what it was.

176
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,240
That's what the English call you.

177
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
Well, that was a long, long time ago.

178
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,400
And there's also all the convenience, or most of the convenience,

179
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,880
I found of what you find in the States.

180
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
Really, really nice.

181
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,360
Australia is okay.

182
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
I think it's an undiscovered frontier.

183
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
Now, you can't just move there and go live there unless you have

184
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,040
like a whole freaking load of cash and you promise to invest it

185
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,640
certain ways and do certain things.

186
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
Or you have to be invited.

187
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
You can't just be sponsored.

188
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,280
Remember, friend of mine, Michele, Michael.

189
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,640
He was a programmer, Janbi, and he had been in Australia.

190
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,320
And he wanted to go back to Australia.

191
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
And he was a physicist.

192
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,160
He was a professor in physics.

193
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,400
And they said, and the Australian officials said,

194
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,720
well, you can't just come here to live with your family.

195
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,440
Unless you have the proper education and whatever.

196
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
And Michael said, yeah, I think I got that.

197
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,840
Until what are you freaking rocket scientists?

198
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
And he said, well, that's a matter of fact, yeah.

199
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,840
I don't know what you're in.

200
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,480
You never know.

201
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,200
He might use it.

202
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,920
He might throw it away, but he might use it.

203
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,880
Well, you go.

204
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,000
He uses lots of crap.

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,400
He does.

206
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,760
Probably when you use that, we say to use lots of crap.

207
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,480
But yeah, okay.

208
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Did that fit out?

209
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,240
So you reckon that?

210
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
That'll be an extra bit of work.

211
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,440
I got a good day.

212
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
Well, podcast, excellent.

213
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:14,720
Excellent.

214
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
This is your daily source code.

215
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,040
It is, well, it's already officially Tuesday.

216
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,240
But we're going to call this the podcast for Monday, December 20, 2004.

217
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,440
And I want to talk about, I really, some stuff started to come together.

218
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,240
The minute Dave hit the road, and if you haven't

219
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
listened to his morning coffee notes podcast,

220
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,640
in fact, you might, if you haven't on your MP3 player right now,

221
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,240
you might want to stop here, listen to that podcast first,

222
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
because I'm not going to play excerpts from it, because it doesn't work

223
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,680
that way with the morning coffee notes.

224
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,280
It's a build-up, it's a story.

225
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,480
I have to listen to the whole thing.

226
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
It's short, it's like 23 minutes.

227
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,280
It's well worth it.

228
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,680
Okay, welcome back.

229
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
I'm glad you listened to that.

230
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,440
And since you just listened to Dave talk for 23 minutes,

231
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,920
let me play you a bit of a drum cadence, everybody.

232
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,520
Yeah, let's kick it, shall we?

233
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,240
This is from Duncan.

234
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,440
It's the FSU drum line from 1997.

235
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,600
I'm just going to play a little bit because it kicks.

236
00:17:31,920 --> 00:18:01,840
You know, I think we should be a podcast.

237
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
It's a drum cadence, you know?

238
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,560
It's like, this is the perfect, if you're just outwalking, you know?

239
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,320
Isn't this pretty motivated?

240
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
I think what way you could do if you remix this.

241
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Goddamn, and think about I'd love to hear some songs.

242
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
People record songs and use a drum cadence like this.

243
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,400
It's awesome.

244
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,120
Okay, so I'll just let that play in the background a little bit while I tuck and make

245
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,600
so to so talk to you a bit about actually, I think it started to click for me

246
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,080
a couple weeks ago, Dave pointed to an old piece that he had written in 2002

247
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
about the monoculture.

248
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,480
I call it dismantling the monoculture and the entire theory.

249
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,320
And I remember reading this piece originally and it just didn't, it didn't kick in.

250
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm thinking maybe I should even just read a part of that hold on.

251
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,920
Or is it there?

252
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,920
I got that speedy Wi-Fi here, everybody.

253
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Mm, loving it.

254
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,040
Here it is.

255
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,520
This is the piece that really like, perhaps the centralized system that led to such a

256
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,400
suffocating monoculture was a historic anomaly and artifact.

257
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
The technology of the phonograph, radio, and television demanded centralization,

258
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,600
distribution was expensive.

259
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,320
To pay for distribution, we needed financial entities who would be rewarded for risks.

260
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,160
Who would be the next beetles, the band that everyone listened to,

261
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,880
maybe in the future there won't be bands that everyone listens to.

262
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,280
Maybe this wouldn't be so horrible as the philosophers of the centralized systems believe.

263
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,640
Perhaps monoculture has run its course.

264
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,640
Maybe that's what's happening right now, but it's hard to see,

265
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,960
is that each of us is taking more responsibility for getting our own information,

266
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
for creating our own entertainment,

267
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,600
and not giving that power to the centralized entertainment and information industries.

268
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Excellent. Excellent.

269
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Written on May 13th, 2002 by Dave Weiner.

270
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,480
So, all of a sudden it just started to click, of course.

271
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,320
You know, if you can record music, you know, if you're like the lascivious bitties,

272
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,800
if you're like a mojoan to record that entire album on a Mac in their attic,

273
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,680
you know, if you can do all that, if we have this wonderful incarnate,

274
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,800
yeah, I got to curse you too now, don't miss Ellie.

275
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,920
If we have this wonderful incarnate, which lets us distribute all this stuff,

276
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,880
then it only makes sense that, you know, we've put this next piece of the puzzle in this podcasting,

277
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,240
where we can act as the intermediaries, the, you know, the way radio guys used to do it,

278
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,880
the way Murray, the K, you know, Murray, the K didn't have some playlists that he was just,

279
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
you know, okay, it's time to play this one or the computer spit it out,

280
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,280
you know, and you can even announce that are backing out and sort of say anything about it,

281
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,880
or even mention that he liked it or not, he just, you know, read the next

282
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,360
liner card to promote, you know, the Saturday night dance party or whatever, you know,

283
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,840
no, he was, he was, he was, you know, they were, remember that was smashing record, you know,

284
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,440
it was like, make it or break it, you know, and then people would call up and say, it sucks,

285
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,640
it's, it's, it's smashing, we'll never play it again, and if it was hit or miss, I mean, all these things have gone,

286
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,720
you know, you don't hear those shows anymore. We're coming back to that, we can now do that,

287
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,480
and that's incredibly exciting. Now, yeah, sure, we're not going to be, uh, clear channel,

288
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,840
we're not going to be billionaires, you know, I, I, I've, no thoughts whatsoever, you know,

289
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,080
that, that, it's not even necessary, it's just not necessary, it's okay to have a couple hundred

290
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,520
people checking it out, or couple thousand, and maybe it's a hundred thousand, maybe it is 50 million,

291
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,440
it really doesn't matter. The system is working, that's the thing that's, uh, that's what,

292
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:08,400
that's what I love so much is that, um, we're rooting around the RIA, although I've got to say

293
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,680
it really, really bothers me that, you know, we can't play these, share these memories, and,

294
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,640
you know, Dave had an interesting idea, you know, that, or it says, he's basically reaching out to the,

295
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,120
to the record companies and saying, you know, why don't you let us use your stuff in some, you know,

296
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,360
uh, low resolution, some low-res manner, so that it really just won't make any difference, if, uh,

297
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,320
it just won't be good enough for recording, and I think personally, uh, and this actually, this used to be,

298
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,840
uh, uh, uh, uh, pre-requisite, and I don't remember if that was Dutch broadcasting rules or US broadcasting rules,

299
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,720
but, um, you were never allowed to play a song beginning to end without, you know, a jingle or talking

300
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
over the intro or talking over the outro, and essentially, I guess, you know, with podcasts,

301
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,760
as long as we do that, there were, you know, we should be okay, and people, it doesn't matter,

302
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,240
forget it, it doesn't matter. We have the proof, people buy albums. They've gone out and they've purchased

303
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,480
CDs of those CDs, bitties, because they heard it on this podcast or other podcasts, and they'd like it,

304
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,400
and that's a really big deal. So, you know, it can be done, but if we get about established artists,

305
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm so incredibly excited about, um, you know, what we can do with this specifically when it comes to music,

306
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,120
and, uh, of course you did listen to Dave's Morning Coffee notes, and I was listening to that,

307
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,200
I was able to download it off the, I saw that he posted it, um, sometime around mid-afternoon,

308
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,400
my time in, uh, in the UK, and I was just able to download it and slip it on to the iRiver,

309
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,640
didn't even put it on the iPot to put onto the iRiver, because that was closer, as I was running out

310
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,920
the door to, uh, to grab the cab to, uh, you know, to get to the airport, and so I listened to it,

311
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,000
uh, half on the way to the airport and half in the plane, it was like, and just it hit me,

312
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,440
it's like, yeah, we can do this, you know, we can totally get this going, and, you know, we, it's,

313
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
we're jelling on it, but, uh, it's just gonna happen, it's so interesting that, you know, we're,

314
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,960
I think, and feel that we're working up towards our January 3rd is when we meet with Ron Bloom in, uh,

315
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,600
in Miami, which shows Miami by the way, because it's warm. And Ron also lives there, so, um,

316
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,360
we got some infrastructure going, but Dave and I are going to stay at, uh, something really cool,

317
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,880
local, you know, like holiday and Ramana in riot, riot, whatever it is, with not with Wi-Fi, but with

318
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:39,920
great, uh, fixed broadband, uh, Ron actually went and, uh, checked it out, and, um, oops, sorry, the drum

319
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,840
cadence is just keep on coming. You heard, uh, what was it? This is Joel's cadence, drum line,

320
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,440
keep that roll on the back. So I was actually thinking of surprising Dave, I hope that we have rooms,

321
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,840
close by. If not, um, I'll get, maybe we'll just get him when I want to get, uh, an Apple airport

322
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:06,000
express, just plug it into the wall, you know, and, and hook up the, um, uh, uh, the Ethernet cable,

323
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,720
and we'll have our own little Wi-Fi network. So, and, you know, we're gonna be working together,

324
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,320
and even though we're gonna be talking about, you know, what we want to do on a business level,

325
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,720
and, you know, they're all kinds of businesses. They're also businesses that are not for profit.

326
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,200
Or not necessarily for profit. Or for enormous amounts of profit. There's all kinds of companies,

327
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:38,320
but we've got something going here, and what, uh, what's happening, and, and Dave and I have,

328
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,280
uh, well, this is something that's, well, I think it used to bother us a little bit more than it does now,

329
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,080
but now we kind of got, they got it figured out that people don't quite understand the story yet.

330
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,440
What happened with podcasting is a story behind all of this, podcasting really came together,

331
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,640
because here was Dave, um, creating podcasts, which is, you know, MP3 files that he was putting up

332
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,480
on his, uh, on scripting news, and he was attached to him to his RSS file, which would be

333
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,760
doing together for years. Uh, but it was like my own personal broadcast that I was receiving,

334
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,400
because I had an aggregator, and I was, uh, that understood in closures, and I was bringing it in,

335
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,880
and I was giving a feedback, and you can look at all the, look at, look at the, uh, around the time

336
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,080
of the Democratic National Convention, and you can see between my weblog and Dave's weblog,

337
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,600
and he was like being the most, I mean, just, he was breaking all the rules of broadcasting,

338
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,840
he was awesome, and shit was, you know, was, wasn't working, and the mic would disconnect,

339
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,040
and it was just, it was an amazing thing to listen to, and I really, really dug it,

340
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,600
and this was around the time that I was, you know, fucking around with programming. So here we are,

341
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,440
I'm, uh, a broadcast or not a programmer, programming something, and then here's Dave, a programmer,

342
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,120
not a broadcast or broadcasting, and it just all, and it was almost like we both had to approach

343
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,440
the same problem from different directions for us to meet in the middle, and that's something

344
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,600
really big and powerful, and, um, and it's gone, and so Dave is now with his voice back, he's,

345
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,400
continue to do his podcasting, and, um, what he's doing is, I mean, you got to subscribe to that

346
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,040
feed, because he tells these incredible stories that build up to something, and, uh, and I'm

347
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,160
really enjoying listening to it, and I'm looking forward to, to, as I said, to seeing him, uh, in,

348
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,440
in Miami, and, uh, and getting some of that energy face to face. Now, I, on the other hand,

349
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,560
work on some programming stuff now, uh, with the open source release of frontier,

350
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,120
and all of these links, of course, everywhere on the production show notes, and I've now, um,

351
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,520
it took me a good portion of the other day, five or six hours, to create a piece of software,

352
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,880
that crawls through the entire ipodder.org directory, because, you know, this is decentralized,

353
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,520
and I'm only maintaining a certain amount of nodes, and then there are all these different nodes

354
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,520
and sub-nodes, which may contain by other people, and, um, basically, I just paste a link into an

355
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,560
outline, and, uh, on the directory, when you click into, like, the music node, you're actually,

356
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,320
pulling an information, uh, from a server, from Holland, and that's rendering in real time,

357
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,280
and below that, there's even, uh, I think the indie music feeds are being maintained by someone

358
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,560
in the states. So, it's completely decentralized, but you have to be able to crawl that entire

359
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,240
directory, so I created a piece of software that does just that, and, um, and, um, and, but now,

360
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:40,640
also, it parses through the, uh, last 100 podcasts page, which is audio.weblogs.com, because,

361
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,120
not everyone who pings that page to say, hey, you know, my, my show is updated, come and check it out.

362
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,840
It's registered in the directory, so now I'm taking all that information, and that's, uh,

363
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,440
and so, you know, whenever I run this thing, there's, like, 40 new podcasts showing up,

364
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,120
and, uh, of course, there's some checking that has to go on for, um, uh, double, you know, um,

365
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,400
duplicate URLs and, and all that. Um, but the next step is, uh, for me to automatically update the

366
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,720
what's new, um, uh, well, I have to, I want to put a process in between, right? So, uh, I can kind of,

367
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,200
uh, just, you know, see what, what's coming through and make some decisions for the beneficiary

368
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,080
if I can route it to a category or a node that I maintain. Then it should update the what's new,

369
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,200
node, and it'll also, um, through XML RPC, uh, post a new podcast, notice on the homepage by

370
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,360
potter.org. So, I hope to get that part done, uh, sometime during, uh, the next couple of days while

371
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm here. Okay, a little bit shorter today, uh, since it is, uh, what's the time here? It's 125,

372
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,240
it's 12, 25 UK times, so I'm not really tired yet, but I really should hit the hay in a couple

373
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,720
minutes. I'm also going to turn out Skype and see if anyone's around before I, I go to bed,

374
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,520
but I cannot leave you before playing this wonderful Christmas message.

375
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,720
Hi, Adam Curry. This is Leanne Westover from the LaCivius Bitties. I just wanted to send you this

376
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,560
quick audio file to say, Merry Christmas. Ever bought it? Boyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoying,

377
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,600
everyone goes well with your mother. I hope you get everything on your list.

378
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,040
And I hope you get dispensed on great quality time with your wife and your daughter.

379
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,400
The second thing I wanted to say is haaaa, Man holidays to everybody that listens to your show.

380
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,760
They've been so wonderful about emailing us and buying the CDs. And I can't tell you how thrilled

381
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,680
we are that they enjoy the music so much. So many many thanks to them. The last thing I

382
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,680
wanted to say is that we do still have tons of CDs available. If they're sold out on Amazon

383
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,360
that's just because Amazon is a huge conglomerant and they can't keep track of a little guy.

384
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,520
But we still have CDs available on CDBaby.com. Those ship to Europe anywhere else around the world

385
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,800
just about as well as our own Bennett Studios store that you can link to off our website. So if

386
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,920
you haven't gotten Christmas presents for your grandma or your five-year-old niece or your girlfriend

387
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:23,360
or your stepdad you can still do it in time. I guess we'll talk to you again after the new year.

388
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,160
Be well, go see some good music and if you're allowed, click as much champagne as you can. Bye bye.

389
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:47,280

394
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:22,640
thing. But yeah. All right, I'll be bringing you more news from Los Petales tomorrow and who knows
