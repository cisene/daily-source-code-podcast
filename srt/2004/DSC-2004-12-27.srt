1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,860
On Pakistani, it's Adam Curry.

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,760
Baekhyunan!

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah, I want to stimulate you right now I have everybody welcome to the daily store's code

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:00,480
Yeah, Christmas officially over 27th of December 2004 welcome to your daily source code

5
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,560
where users and developers attempt to party together and sometimes we actually do some kind of awkward dance

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,920
that looks a little bit like it I guess. How you doing?

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:20,000
I got to say I am doing fantastic today. Everything would be absolutely perfect. I mean we've got

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,400
Beautiful sunshine outside here outside the cottage. It's snow just a little bit last night

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,680
So everything is blanketed and nice little sheet of white. If only we hadn't lost

10
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:41,120
20,000 people in Asia with the tsunamis then my day would be absolutely perfect man does that shit suck all what

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,160
Mother earth you can't beat her the beots will get you down every single time

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:58,560
And what's perhaps? Of course it's always like that you know if you've ever been to

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,240
Junior York and you went to the world trade towers before September 11th

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,560
Then you have the same feeling that many many people have all been to

15
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:17,200
Sri Lanka the Maldees I've been to Thailand did all documentary in fact and was along the entire coastline

16
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,240
Where people just swept away and what what's really quite frightening about and I wasn't even going to talk about this really

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
But what's what's a frightening about it is

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,280
It went from like a couple hundred to a thousand to two thousand to four thousand to six thousand and it seems like this

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,480
Just like it's so enormous that we have and it could be 30,000 people for all I know this morning

20
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
CNN was reporting 20,000 people dead

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Unbelievable

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
This will lift up your spirits a little bit a little bit of the

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,920
University of Southern California marching back a cadence on the source code. Oh my gosh. Who would have thought it?

24
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Actually, this was sent to me by

25
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,920
Aaron Tadas who has lots of questions about podcasting and of course all of the

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
emails the links

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,280
Everything but the actual MP3s themselves to the

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,240
The promos into the songs that we play on the daily source code

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,880
are all listed in the production show notes which are posted along with the daily source code on

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
www.curry.com

31
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,400
Working on this stuff though. I've been

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
emailing back and forth with Dave

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
We've been talking on the phone

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,520
Getting pretty close to actually starting some work on on getting a

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
podcast production system put together and the way we're doing this. I'm so incredibly excited about because

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,000
Basically Dave is is programming just for me and only for me

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,400
And then from there we'll go figure out if other people are going to be able to use this or not so I'm really really excited

38
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
About the work that we're doing and

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,160
Yeah, just to you know getting some stuff moving forward and this is all pre-art January meeting

40
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,120
I mean we still have a whole week before I actually we're before we're scheduled to meet up in Miami. So very cool

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,760
So the in-laws are leaving today

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,480
They were here for the past 10 days of course a major portion of that. I was in I was in Holland

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,640
By the way the opening today I just want to play the

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,560
I'll play the the opening bit of that because it was such a beautiful such a beautiful

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Song with the power of pure intellect sung and acoustic with the guitar

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Just want to let you hear a few words from the from the maker of that wonderful promo

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Hi Adam. This is Stefan. I'm sorry to have missed you at the Sarasani coffee shop

48
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
All right, so that's

49
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,000
This is a source code listener from Utrecht

50
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,600
Who we tried to hook up at a different coffee shop in in Utrecht, but it just didn't work out with

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,640
Traveling to the hospital in my mom and doing other stuff, but

52
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,240
Oh next time I'm sure I left you know it's just in case you were

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
We're going to be there and

54
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,520
And well then you would at least know that I've been there as well. I left you in my party boy

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,880
The owner taught actually thank me a lot for making my compliments to you about this place because it's the oldest oldest coffee shop in the world

56
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,480
Huh, maybe this is the oldest coffee shop in the world

57
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Perhaps the oldest coffee shop that's spelled that sells marijuana in the world

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,640
I think I've been to older coffee shops in Iraq

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,560
What did you consider part where the and as a thank you

60
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,480
I'd like to give you a demonstration of what this great quality weed here can do for your inspiration

61
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Okay, so this is what the great quality weed at the the oldest coffee shop in the world can do for your inspiration

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Actually, thank you very very very very much. Hey Adam. This is Garic Van Geron from the first crack podcast

63
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
Garic Van Geron dot com slash first crack

64
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
As you can hear in the background we are roasting up some beans for tomorrow's coffee

65
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
I wanted to wish you a happy holidays and hope you that you've received the gift of bandwidth

66
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
This holiday season

67
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Here's a quick snippet of what some people are saying about the first crack podcast

68
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,480
That's completely not about coffee

69
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
That was band-tash from first crack episode number 14 where we talked about his site all right

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Wraydard.com

71
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,320
One last thing over at garyconvian.com slash first crack you can pick up your iPod cast buttons and show the world that you've turned your domain

72
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
into a radio station in your ear into a voice that's all and

73
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
Have a great show and have a great 2005 and we'll talk to you guys later. Bye

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,320
Excellent. Thank you, Garic. Garic Van Geron turn your was it turn your domain into a

75
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
Radio station and your ear into a voice. Not bad like that

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
It seems that

77
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
The living room in New York City which is a venue

78
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,400
That we first were introduced to on the source code when the lascivious bitties did their show there and I think

79
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,160
For daily source code listener showed up which is I don't have big the living room is I have a feeling it's pretty small

80
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,920
But I'm quite proud of anyone showing about the lascivious bitties show based upon my recommendation

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,320
An email from Craig Patchett says hey Adam living room in New York City seems to be the venue for daily source code artists

82
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,400
Barry Correll who we've played on the show before will be performing there on Thursday, January

83
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,800
6 and Craig of course is from the godcast and I don't have a lot of music queueed up for for you today

84
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,680
But I'm sure we've playing some Barry in in the future right here on the daily source code something else that's coming that a couple of people have mentioned

85
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,920
About the sample rate of the shows that I release now. I was pretty sure that I'm doing these recordings on

86
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
44 kilohertz sample rates

87
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,920
Apparently the daily source code is coming through in 24 kilohertz sample rates and a number of

88
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,160
Predominantly portable devices like the palm t3 and I've heard

89
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,200
I've heard there was some other device maybe the trio as well not too sure about that

90
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,320
Only supports 22 or 44 and not 24 kilohertz

91
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,400
So I'm gonna have to go through my entire chain in fact

92
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,320
I'm looking at this right now and I hope that you saw the the beautiful work that was done on

93
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,600
Creating the image of of my podcast setup

94
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
And I'm looking at this right now if I

95
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,480
I guess I can't look at that yet. I'm recording at 16 bit stereo 44.1 kilohertz

96
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
I don't understand how can I be coming through it 24.1 if I'm recording it

97
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,720
At 44.1. Well if anyone out there has any ideas, please let me know because we don't want to leave our

98
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
Certainly don't want to leave our our mobile

99
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Daily source code listeners out in the cold

100
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,480
By not being able to receive it because it comes through as 24 kilohertz it could all maybe

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,440
Maybe lane brain for some reason that's what I used to post compressed every show because I basically recorded to AIFF

102
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,680
And then I post compressed with a program called lane brain hold on let's take a look and see what the settings of lane brain are right now

103
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,560
Can I do this while I'm while I'm running

104
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Boy, it's getting real slow

105
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,560
You know one of these days I am going to treat myself to a brand new computer maybe a honk in G5 or something

106
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,840
It would just it'll only be a podcast machine wouldn't that be awesome

107
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Okay, I'm just going to open up this this lane brain application hope everything will work

108
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
Work okay, and it won't start to skip on the audio. Let me just see what the settings are

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,520
Meanwhile is anything I can play for you

110
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,080
oops, I'm on why don't I yeah, well, that's loading up. We'll play this for you

111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
Yeah, I'm it's Patrick Carney from over at

112
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,400
www.pjk.net. I do my own podcast called the pjk podcast

113
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Anyway, I wanted to let you know I just did a show on emergency technology and it was based on my own

114
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,960
Emergency over Christmas Eve where my apartment caught on fire and had to get my daughter out and what kind of tech did I grab and that kind of thing

115
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,360
And it also you know got me thinking especially after seeing this huge earthquake

116
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,160
In the news and all the devastation in

117
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,760
Thousands and thousands of people killed because of that

118
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Started making me think about back up plans and things in the event of a real emergency

119
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Whether it's natural or or man made anyway, so I go through some of those thoughts on my podcast

120
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,760
And just thought I'd point you to it. Anyway, I hope you have a Merry Christmas happy new year and

121
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,520
You know keep on podcast, man. It sounds great. I love your show

122
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,360
Hey Patrick. Thank you very much and I definitely will check that out because man

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Think about what kind of an emergency Jesus Christ if you have your apartment caught on fire

124
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
Over the over Christmas and you had to get your daughter out and what kind of tech to you actually want to say

125
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
Oh shit

126
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,440
That's the stuff nightmares are made of my friend. I'm looking at a

127
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,480
Lame brain and it doesn't seem to have any

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Any other preferences for

129
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
For the actual recording

130
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,160
Frequency or bit rate. I you know, I can't find it if you have any ideas. Let me know please

131
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,720
Okay, oh, yeah, by the way, looking at today

132
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,400
I really really need to fly. I am just itching to fly. Here's the deal

133
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,760
I haven't flown for what is it six weeks now

134
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
Now, it's not true because I flew over here with the Navajo

135
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,000
So it's been five weeks we've been here for five weeks. I need to fly and I'm not even talking about helicopters

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,520
I'd love to get in a helicopter and you know fly around for a little bit and I'll probably just schedule something with someone nearby

137
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,280
But what I'm looking for really and if anyone out there is a pilot and I'm sure some of you are

138
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,960
I'm looking for some advice for a great instructor

139
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,640
Someone who can help me with fixed wing because I have my helicopter ppl rating

140
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
You know, so

141
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,520
Basically with an FAA private pilot's license. It's an add-on. You have to do a minimum of I don't know what is it?

142
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,680
Well really in all fairness. I should I should do at least 40 or 50 hours on fixed wing before I can

143
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,880
Really do the test although I'm sure that with 10 or 20 hours I'll be able to pass the test of course

144
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,440
I won't know what you know shit about flying airplanes really

145
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,440
So I'm looking for someone who can help me get the FAA

146
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
PPL add-on to my license

147
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm right near black bush. I'm not too far from farm borough. If anyone has any ideas

148
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Just you know someone who can do

149
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
Instruction on either regular basis or maybe will do four days in a row

150
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
And I'm looking for at least the Cessna 172 152 is a little bit too small for me

151
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
So 172 I just need to get this done and just I need to fly because it's such a you could

152
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
The airplanes go over or close by our house all the time and every single time

153
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,440
I'm like oh yeah, I need to fly. I need to fly. I really really need to fly somewhere around

154
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,840
Second week of January. I want to get started on this so if you're if you have any ideas

155
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,120
Any thoughts of great instructors because that's what it comes down to it's not really the flight school

156
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,360
Although I know there's a flight school of black bush airport which does FAA ratings

157
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,280
I just need to fly. I need to learn to fly. I can get my license and in Florida

158
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,280
I need someone to teach me how to fly. Please teach me how to fly and as I was

159
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,720
Sitting on that humongous fat pipe in in Utrecht while I was with my mom who was doing excellent by the way

160
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,320
She's she's walking she walked down to the Christmas tree the other day and I think either tomorrow or the day after

161
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:54,240
We hear about you know when she potentially can actually leave the hospital and we're very excited about that because things are going so incredibly well

162
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,640
So I was sitting on that big fat pipe and there were a couple of audible

163
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,840
Audio books that I had downloaded previously and then I or that I hadn't

164
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
Downloaded that I needed to download because I really wanted to listen to it and I had to had

165
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,760
Downloaded George Carlin's brain droppings previously, but I guess I'd wipe that off my drive and then the great thing about

166
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,000
Autable.com is that you had this entire library so you can just read download anything you've already purchased previously

167
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,200
And I wanted to play this lovely bit. It's it's probably a couple minutes long about three or four minutes

168
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,320
The George car and in this man needs to podcast and he would be the perfect

169
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,440
Person for a weekly or God forbid a daily podcast and it could be short it could be sweet and if I ever run into him

170
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
I'm gonna strap him down and make him do one

171
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,960
Here George Carlin talks about the United States not having a present

172
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
You know what America lacks a

173
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,280
Present America has no now

174
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
We're reluctant to acknowledge the present. I guess it's too embarrassing

175
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,760
Instead we reach into the past our culture is composed of sequels reruns

176
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,000
Remix revivals reissues re-releases recreations reenactments

177
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Adaptations anniversary's memorabilia oldies radio and nostalgia record collections

178
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,080
World war two has been refought on television so many times

179
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,280
The Germans and Japanese are now drawing residuals

180
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,960
Of course being essentially full of shit we sometimes feel the need to dress up this past preoccupation as with

181
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,520
Pathetic references to reruns as on core presentations

182
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,440
Even instant replay is a form of token nostalgia a brief visit to the immediate past for re-examination

183
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,000
Before slapping an onto a highlight video for further review and re-review on into the indefinite future

184
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:02,880
This yes-termania of ours includes fantasy baseball camps where aging sad-sax paid money to catch baseballs thrown by men who are once their heroes

185
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,120
It's part of the fascination with sports memorabilia a memory industry and it's so lucrative

186
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
It is attracted counterfeiters

187
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
In this case the age of hyphens

188
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:21,600
We are truly retro Americans and our television newscasts not only reflect this condition they feed it

189
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,840
Everything they report is twisted into some reference to the past

190
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,160
If there's going to be a summit meeting you'll be told all about the last six summit meetings

191
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
If there's a big earthquake they'll do a story about big earthquakes of the past

192
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,840
If there's a mind disaster you'll hear about every mind disaster since the inception of mining

193
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,120
They're obsessed with looking back. I swear. I actually heard this next thing during a newscast

194
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,880
As the anchor man went to a commercial break. He said still ahead a look back

195
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,840
Honest he said it

196
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
Hurricane Hugo one year later. Why?

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,520
The anniversary of the exonvaldees oil spill for what reason?

198
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,680
The anniversary of the Bay of Pigs pan Amphlite 103 the hostages in Iran the fall of the Berlin wall

199
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,960
V. J. Dave E. Dave yet none who gives a fuck

200
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,760
Bugs bunny's 50th birthday lasties 55th the gold in Jubilee of gone with the wind the start of the Korean war

201
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,920
Barbies celebrates her 35th the 25th anniversary of the New York blackout

202
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,760
Bambi turns 50 should I didn't even like Bambi when I was supposed to how much do I care now

203
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,920
There's really no harm I guess in reviewing the past from time to time knowing where you've been

204
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,120
This part of knowing where you are and all that happy horse shit

205
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,880
But the American media have an absolute fixation on this they rob us of the present by insisting on the past

206
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,360
If they were able I'm sure they would pay equal attention to the future trouble is they don't have any fell on it

207
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,040
And so on television news there is oddly very little emphasis on the present on today's actual news

208
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,880
The present exists only in 30 second stories built around eight second sound bites

209
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,560
Remember sound bite is their phrase that's if they give you just a bite no chewing no digestion no nourishment

210
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,880
Malnutrition

211
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,280
Another way they avoid the present moment is to look ahead on their own schedules

212
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,520
The television news industry seems to revolve around what's coming next

213
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,520
Still to come just ahead up next coming up this half hour more to come stay with us still ahead also later

214
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,080
They even preview what's going to happen as little as one hour later

215
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,000
During the five o'clock news the empty headed prick who does the five o'clock news will suddenly say

216
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,640
Here's a look at what's coming up on the six o'clock news

217
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,280
Then the empty headed prick who does the six o'clock news will appear in shirts leaves in the newsroom to create the illusion of actual work

218
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,880
And tell you about several stories that the empty headed prick who does the five o'clock news should already have told you about if you were really a newsman

219
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
And so it goes around the clock

220
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,880
On the five o'clock news to tell you about the six o'clock news at six o'clock they tell you about eleven at eleven

221
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,080
They plug the morning news the morning man promos the noon time lady and sure enough a little later after noon

222
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,560
Here comes that empty headed prick from the five o'clock news to tell you what he's gonna do on the five o'clock news

223
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
You know if a guy were paranoid

224
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,840
He might not be blamed for thinking that the people who run things don't want you dwelling too much on the present

225
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
Because keep in mind the news media are not independent

226
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,000
They're a sort of bulletin board and public relations firm for the ruling class the people who run things

227
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,840
Those who decide what news you will or will not hear are paid by and tolerated purely at the whim of those who hold

228
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,760
Economic power if the parent corporation doesn't want you to know something it won't be on the news

229
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,440
period

230
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Or at the very least it will be slanted to suit them and then barely followed up

231
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Enjoy your snooze folks

232
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,280
Ha ha ha

233
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,280
George Carlin the man rocks he rocks you rock so

234
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,480
The reason I played that is first of all there must be a lot of recognition in there

235
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,920
Even the stuff that he said about a major earthquake. Oh, we're seeing that right now and take a look at what's happening now

236
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
that we've gotten past the initial

237
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
Footage we're gonna start doing statistics, but

238
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
It's true the media

239
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,200
Is yeah is not giving you the story. It's only giving you the story that they want you to have that the big corporations

240
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,840
Want you to have this is what we're trying to get away from in podcasting. That's why I yeah

241
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,040
I play that for you

242
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,640
What we're trying to get closer to is people helping each other out with a god damn microphones

243
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,960
Tip for anyone looking for a microphone still

244
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,640
There's a deal over at target for a member x m k a three zero one. Oh wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Surely you mean

245
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Tarji

246
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
It's old over next to the karaoke equipment

247
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,040
There's also a wireless model available for anyone who needs a little more mobility

248
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,920
Although this one seems to have a very long cord. It's about 10 feet long

249
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
Has an XLR jack on the one end and the quarter inch jack on the other end

250
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
So you'll probably need the adapter for most PCs which they also conveniently sell

251
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,280
Anyways, I want to also say thanks for the show and

252
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,520
Appreciate all that you're doing and thanks very much

253
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
Oh, man, I'm not doing anything. I'm just having a good all-time

254
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,560
Happened some fun. What are we? We're about 21 minutes into the show good because I have a couple more things

255
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,360
I want to play for you. I've received a whole bunch of cool audio comments and and emails over the

256
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,880
Over the Christmas weekend and something that I just reached back to once in a while is the agricast

257
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,480
It's listed on the iPutter.org directory under agriculture

258
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,240
And the agricast is an actual business model. There's a real case here

259
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
This is really working. This is a podcast

260
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,320
For the agricultural industry and from time to time I just want to just want to play this because you know that someone is out there thinking

261
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,200
How can you start a business what what what kind of really do with podcasting?

262
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,560
Well, it's just like web logs, man. It's just like it in this case. Now let's listen to the agricast

263
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,080
Welcome to another subject county extension agricast with extension agagent Gary Cramer today

264
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,280
We're going by telephone the Gary's home where he's recuperating from leg surgery. We join Gary now

265
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,600
By the way, that's odd. Hi, this is Gary Cramer an agricast. Here it is. It's December the 23rd

266
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,880
And it is extremely frigid outside and you know it it happens every year

267
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,200
That we've got some acres of wheat ground that don't get planted don't get worked for one raisin or another

268
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,840
And we'll occasionally get questions about how late is too late to plant wheat

269
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
So this whole this whole cast

270
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,160
Podcast goes on about planting wheat. Now of course personally I'd like to know

271
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,280
Instead of planting wheat, you know, how should we plant marijuana how could we harvest it? You know what I do

272
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,840
We've already been through that experiment didn't work too well

273
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,120
But I just love hearing the this professional use of of podcasting and

274
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,000
And look so the guys recuperating from leg surgery no problem dilemma get them on the phone

275
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,200
This is what podcasting is is partially at least about this is great. This is disseminating information

276
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,960
We've got the tools that before only the professionals had

277
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Speaking of tools

278
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,800
I've been talking about this OPML

279
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Application which of course is actually the open source

280
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Release of frontier

281
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
That's at

282
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
What's the link to that

283
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,000
Well, there's a there's a group there's a Yahoo group and that's of course it's all listed in the production show notes for today

284
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,360
What am I thinking

285
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,480
Steve ran into a little bit of trouble Steve Holden as for some reason whenever he tried to open up an OPML file that I'm now

286
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,840
Posting along with the source code it wouldn't open up properly

287
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,400
Actually I saw later that he in the comments that he did fix this just let you know that there's there's something coming with this OPML stuff and if you

288
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
if you feel like

289
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
downloading the

290
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,320
It may be a little bit early actually to do that, but pretty soon. I think that it's going to be

291
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:24,400
Really simple to create your podcast using using an outline and also to flow stuff in from other shows

292
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,840
You know you could get stuff from my outline and I don't know

293
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,840
We're still all over the map on this but getting pretty close to some very interesting stuff and

294
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
I don't know what I was gonna say

295
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I'm so full of shit sometimes

296
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Tell you what so is this guy?

297
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,880
Hi Adam. This is Quentin's Stafford Fraser and this is coming to you from Cambridge in England. Oh, okay

298
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,720
Clearly just a little bit north and I'm recording this on a little I talk plugged into my iPod here

299
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
And these I talk so

300
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,280
Wonderful things but because of a limitation and the iPod the audio quality is is not very high

301
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,640
I have to say this is the first time I've heard an eye talk or one of those is that maybe that's the belkin is that the eye talk

302
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,240
Actually, it doesn't sound too bad. I said, but there's also some funny acoustic here

303
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,280
Yeah, because this is coming to you from my boss

304
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,560
Yes, I'm quite serious because he's splashing oh

305
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Actually, I'm doing can any hear me

306
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,480
Seeing me in my bottle of alcohol is a lot of pretty sight the great thing about audio broadcasts

307
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,080
You could pretend that you know there was something kind of handsome standing lying here, but no, I would not know dude

308
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,240
I don't want to pretend that either

309
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,800
If I pretended that seeing me in my bath was something anyone should afford to

310
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,080
But there was a reason for this and for a casting to you from my boss not the group besides just a gross as all out. Yeah, go ahead

311
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Good one. Oh, bro. You but

312
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,240
I was in hospital briefly just a couple of days ago and I have this dressing which I'm not meant to get wet for a couple of days

313
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
So instead of my usual showers

314
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I've been having bath and

315
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,840
It is all sorts of things you can do in a bath, which are different from things you can do in a shower

316
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,240
This I I know we carry my iPod around

317
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,000
The house with me. I have

318
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,920
One of these little Sony travel speaker things and it's battery pad

319
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,280
And I plug in into my iPod and quite often listen to things like BBC feeds or the daily sort code

320
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,680
While I'm shading and so this is something that is this grossing you out. It sure is grossing me

321
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, I'm talking to you in the bath and then it's okay to me that I could actually record a response to you in the bath as well

322
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,240
And so you are listening to another innovation from Cambridge, which is I think of the first ever bath

323
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
bath cast

324
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,600
If you're from almost anywhere in the world other than the Southern England

325
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,520
Now, you know, there are various I think merchandising opportunities here because

326
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,800
This is my iPod in the bath and iPods are not really designed to go with baths very well and

327
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,080
If I drop this it would not be a very happy iPod. So I think all those manufacturers out there who are making

328
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,720
Interesting sort of cases and add-ons on the southern friday pots should

329
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,520
A lot of speakers kind of rubber duck or one of those little yellow ducks you could even bid your iPod in so that it would be

330
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
safe in the bath or something like that

331
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,600
Anyway, I feel you're not going to get very many more bath cast from Cambridge because where's the first female bath cast then from Cambridge?

332
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,440
I was uh, I normally are kind of sharing guy and you know

333
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,480
I got to say I'm also normally a showing kind of guy myself. You know, I run a weblog her status

334
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,080
You know, you don't run a weblog my friend. You want to wet log dog

335
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,680
But I think shellocasting well that would just be silly, wouldn't it?

336
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
Hmm

337
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,720
Okay, actually this this is a part of a larger question that Dave actually posted on

338
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
iPod.org

339
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,520
The question that he posted is what's wrong with the iPod? By the way a lot of you probably got an iPod for Christmas

340
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,160
I gave Christina an iPod MIDI for Christmas, which she didn't even know she was getting she didn't even think she would get it because she knows how expensive

341
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,120
They are

342
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,760
Which made the surprise all that much nicer, obviously

343
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
But there's a lot wrong with it. If you look at the postings again a link

344
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,960
To the iPod.org posting from the production show notes for today

345
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,440
There's a lot. There's a lot of things that can be improved obviously and add on for a rubber duckie so that

346
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Good old quentin can

347
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,680
Can play with his iPod in the bath is one thing, but the fact you know the idea of listening to a podcast

348
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,440
And then hitting a button to automatically record a response and have that handled somehow

349
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,480
I think it's pretty cool. That would be nice. You know from listen to a to a

350
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,840
To a podcast and I say hi. I want to respond and then just hit it and it could you know it could mark what I was responding to?

351
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,280
What point in the in the podcast record that and then send it off appropriately if all the data was all there and we knew where to send it

352
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,800
etc. They could happen. They could happen. So if you have any thoughts about

353
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,680
What's wrong with the iPod or maybe a little or positive is what can we do to make the iPod better or to make a better iPod?

354
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,080
Which doesn't even have to be called an iPad iPod?

355
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,960
Nor does it have to be made by Apple necessarily

356
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,480
You know post the post a comment there. What do you say a little bit of music? I'm ready for some music not too much though

357
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,600
Just about a minute or so because I don't know if you can handle this. It's a mashup

358
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,240
Which I received from Ian Robbins

359
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,760
I came across this mashup today thought I might find entertaining. It's called just lose the accordion

360
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,640
And if you're

361
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,120
an M fan you'll think oh my god here comes and indeed

362
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Oh

363
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,280
Every one of my boy to the dance floor to the dance floor to the dance floor

364
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:40,960
I'm an M on the accordion there if you want to hear the whole song I don't know if you could actually handle

365
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,080
Well, I guess you could skip through it. Okay. I'll be honest with you

366
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,800
The download broke after 55 seconds and I'm still on a modem dial-up so I don't have more than that

367
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,360
But of course, I have the original link to that

368
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,200
MP3 in the production show notes M and M in the accordion mix

369
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,560
Definitely different. That's for sure. See something else I posted the last night about

370
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,680
Creating an iPodter for my GSM cell phone lots of responses to that although it seems that apparently and I and I actually tested this

371
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I have the what do I have? I have my Sony Ericsson. I don't get this because

372
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,480
The Sony Ericsson I can I can Bluetooth from one phone to the next and resend and receive no problem

373
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,240
I can send to my Mac but however when I want to transfer something from my Mac back to the Sony Ericsson

374
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,080
I try Bluetooth file browser and I try

375
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,560
Yeah, basically the file browser and I try to direct upload and I'll try the browser device and in both cases it cuts off the connection

376
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,000
And apparently it's not that easy to send stuff to your Bluetooth phone from

377
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,640
From a Mac or there's lots of hiccups and handy caps and work around that you need to

378
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Need to put in place

379
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,080
So if you have any more information on that I'd love to know about it because the idea is

380
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,280
I mean if you already have your iPodter running right and your iPodter basically writes all your new podcast out to your

381
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
iTunes your Windows

382
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Media player and that eventually onto your MP3 player. Why couldn't you just add a little extra process?

383
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:20,000
That said, okay my favorite favorite favorite podcast the one that I need to have every single day and I want it with me

384
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Can be transferred

385
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,480
From the iPodter itself through Bluetooth onto my cell phone, which is basically sitting next to the computer anyway being charged

386
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
And since I can only fit I think was it I have a 40-meg

387
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,680
Storage space on it. It would have to put one on and it removed the one from the day before essentially, but it could be

388
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,440
It could be something that's very useful not maybe not for

389
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Source code or dawn and drew, but maybe for some

390
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,320
You know partner information that you just need to have and then the great thing about it is you're the iPodter could be running anywhere

391
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:02,480
Right because you only just need to basically authenticate that this is the the cell phone that the podcast has to go to and I think it will kind of just work

392
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:09,840
And as I was thinking about that, I thought Jesus Christ you know my Audi actually had some iPodter technology or at least philosophy built into it

393
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,320
It has the traffic monitoring system, which I think we've played on the show before and

394
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,320
What that does is it monitors you know, there's there's all kinds of

395
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,440
Montering systems throughout Europe and it knows where the traffic jams are if it's if it's

396
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,200
Still standing traffic or if it's slow moving traffic the length of the traffic jam, et cetera

397
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,960
It also often knows you know what the cause is road works or accident

398
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,080
Something else though, you've probably heard the BBC

399
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,640
Road reports cut into my studio a8 as I'm driving you know as I'm not driving as I'm recording in the Audi

400
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,800
So those reports are actually recorded in and and I geez I'm not in the obviously I'm not in the car

401
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,840
But next time I'm in the car I'll let you hear him it records up to like 30 different or 30

402
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,800
Previous reports so in the morning when you get in the car the past 30 reports that have been broadcast

403
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,360
Even though the car was off, you know, it's been locked the alarms on it's out

404
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,440
It's sitting there recording these road reports so you can you know go back

405
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,440
It depends on how often they do them, but in the morning sometimes every five or 10 minutes and you can hear those reports

406
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,480
That is basic iPodter technology and

407
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
And to think that you know, they still can't

408
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:29,600
Just send me an Excel sheet from or some spreadsheet directly from the car at the end of the month, which says

409
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,320
Okay, here's the trip she took here's what the mileage was here's who you went to see and it should just email it to me from its built in

410
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
GSM phone

411
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,960
Now of course, that'll be way too smart. It would be exactly what we wanted and that would be I guess wrong

412
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Okay, let's see

413
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,720
I got this thing about the the Gilmore gang that I picked up

414
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,080
I don't know if I want to play that right now because it's about four minutes it basically was it's a great piece of

415
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,440
The Gilmore gang where Mitch Kurtzman who I guess is a venture capital

416
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,800
Venture capitalist talks about you know, let's let's play let's play a little piece of it

417
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,520
What the hell let's play just a bit of the Gilmore gang from the 24th yeah

418
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,600
It'll be about four minutes, but worth it to listen to a venture capitalist who

419
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:28,400
Well, who knows what he's about and and knows about what's happening right now and I think there are some exciting times if you happen to be looking for money for a start-up company

420
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,320
You know Larry Elson saying that there's going to be a consolidation and then going out and buying

421
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
bunch of companies

422
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Self-prefetic

423
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What's the fundamental

424
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,840
It's leading the Alson to do this if if customers are going to have less choice

425
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,280
Isn't that going to make their job of being in control a little bit more difficult rather than the other way around?

426
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Well, that's this probably falls into for customers to be careful what you wish for

427
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
category

428
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,000
Because it you know my guess is that the customers will always make sure that there are alternatives

429
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,800
And if they're on any you know the alternatives will be created just because everybody's going to want at least two or three competitors in the major market spaces

430
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,160
You know, I'm sorry. I had to witness someone talking about market spaces

431
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,920
Predictions are mixed because Larry Larry's effectively said two things one as he said they'll be consolidation

432
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:33,600
But the other thing he said that I I really disagree with is he's also predicted that innovation isn't going to matter any more

433
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,000
And it's kind of the end of it end of innovation and the you know the

434
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,560
Software industry the technology business is going to look a lot like a you know like the car business or something where there aren't

435
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,320
You see those comments echoed and

436
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,360
You know and someone silly manners and articles and everything's in the New York Times with a Wall Street Journal

437
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,000
So what is you know if you look up and down the valley. I was talking to some of the folks who you know

438
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,920
Including John silly Brown who was saying he's never seen more innovation. They invalid today than any time in the last 10 years

439
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,480
So what things do you think are going to be innovative coming out in the next you know

440
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,120
Two to five years of whatever window you want to pick well. I wish I knew I mean

441
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
As venture capitalists you mean you don't know we we tell well

442
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,560
I I Dan Gilmour told me any promise he's warning me to secrecy

443
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Yeah, so

444
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
A point blind blind for stay

445
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,160
As venture investors I think we we see only a little bit into the future, but

446
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,000
You know everything that we feel rise if we were really that smart we'd probably be back wanting companies instead

447
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,120
Don't you love it one venture capitalists recognize that does great major investing like we are

448
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,280
So instead what I I would agree that we're seeing a phenomenal amount of innovation

449
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,760
I think part of it is there was a tenth we've been through a period if you look at the last

450
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,920
You know decade or so we went through I think some innovation at the beginning of the internet and then the internet bubble and craze

451
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,760
Was not really a lot about innovation it was about business models and distribution and

452
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,680
Financing and going public and we didn't see a lot of innovation during that period. I mean we can come up with instances and exceptions

453
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,440
But venture capitalists for funding business models not technologies. Then we went through the recovery from the bubble

454
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,280
And this

455
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,760
Dirth of innovation because everybody had their heads down people weren't investing in anything

456
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,520
If you had a job you were keeping it you weren't risking

457
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,320
All by leaving your your paying job and going starting the new company and so it's only been I think in the last

458
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
year or two that

459
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,440
That really talented entrepreneurs are starting to pick up their heads and go to go out and get funding for some great ideas

460
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,680
And now it's not about business models. It's all about innovation and technology

461
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,760
So it's I completely agree with the observation that it's the most innovative time I've seen in a long time

462
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,440
And that is in I think in a major part

463
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,640
Thanks to stuff like podcasting. I haven't finished the entire show because they go on to talk about okay

464
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,160
So what is them of this great innovation and like hmm got really boring

465
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,840
Because I didn't hear any podcasting mentioned, but I'm sure if I listen to the whole things

466
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,280
Steve Gilmore probably slipped it is somewhere in a world gone mad

467
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
Where everything you know is wrong

468
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,600
One man

469
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,800
He's quiet and a quest to find a softer toilet paper

470
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,440
It will shake the very foundation of what is right

471
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:01,440
If you only listen to one podcast this holiday season you owe it to the world to listen to the daily download

472
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,640
The poop report

473
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Paul's Chris Rockwell's performance

474
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,320
Solid

475
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:17,200
Play Akin gives the daily download two thumbs up the butthole and Oprah Winfrey says with an ass like mine

476
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,120
I'm so glad I have the support I need that's only available from the daily down

477
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,040
The daily download starring the Reverend Chris Rockwell as Bill and the Americans standard toilet

478
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
As his side kick plans

479
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,320
Red and directed by Chris Rockwell a jury brought high in production

480
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
This podcast is not yet been raped

481
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,360
Hotcast is not guaranteed to improve

482
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,280
Check out eight boy monkey girl dot com. I gotta tell you there's something about talking about poop

483
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,480
Doesn't for me the daily download something you definitely don't want to check out

484
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,440
Yes, it's the podcast you need to listen to if you want to be just plain old regular

485
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
You

486
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,360
All right, everybody that's it for the source code for the 20% of the summer

487
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,160
Just about to wind out the year will have the more podcast pleasure coming up this week more about the

488
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,920

489
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,680

495
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,600
