1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Augustine, all's live!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Adam Curry!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, everybody crank it up!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And welcome to your daily source code!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Coming to you from the UK, this is the source code for...

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, man, it's Monday, November 29, 2004.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're in studio.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, not actually not the it's studio A, I'm in studio A8.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Which means I'm in the Audi.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The Audi A8 is the new studio.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's the place to be.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It had a nice weekend.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Went off to the Netherlands to do a little bit of business.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Had some friends putting together a television pilot,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which I instigated called Adams of Eagle Eye,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
based around two friends of mine.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Both presenters, one legendary news guy,

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
who's about 55 years old and is definitely seeing a revival

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that is career and man, it was a lot of fun.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm really even more fun was just figuring out

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and actually experiencing how close the UK really is

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and how easy it is to get more pretty much anywhere.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I left Saturday morning to the car picking up at 8 o'clock.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Had me at Heathrow at a quarter to nine,

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was on board the plane at 9.30.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I was an Amsterdam, I see a quarter to an hour.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I was already in the Amsterdam bunker before noon,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think, or just a little bit past noon.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, not bad all things are considered.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, power up here and nothing.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All that stuff, okay.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So, let me see.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, the most important thing of the entire trip

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
for me personally besides, of course,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
all the fun we had doing the TV show,

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
which was a total, what do you call it?

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
One weekend in Holland and all of a sudden

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I lose all my English volunteer.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All of, we basically called up all our buddies

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and said, look, we need a couple camera people,

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
we need some producers, some sound people,

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
everyone chipped in and we created,

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
even studio was donated time.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Of course, if we actually sell this pilot

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and we get it on the air, then of course,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
everyone will be waiting there where they're hand out

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
because then they'll get paid and they'll be working

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
on the show, which is the way this is supposed to work.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, it was a lot of fun.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I'd book to hotel through,

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I actually just did a Google search before I left

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and said, I want to Wi-Fi,

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
enabled hotel in Hilversum.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I know of some really good hotels in Hilversum,

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which is kind of the Hollywood of the Netherlands.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, you know, reason to go to hotels,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but none of them had anything that resembled Wi-Fi

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
or actually even broadband.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They were still talking about telephone with data ports.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So, didn't, didn't book there,

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
found a hotel called Revell,

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
excuse me, which I posted about on my weblog.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And walked in there around a 10pm,

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
of course, it was a late check-in.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I think it might've been the owner

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
if not definitely a manager who said,

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
oh, you know, Adam, welcome.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I already heard on your podcast,

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you're coming.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I just need your MAC address,

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which is, you know, the Ethernet address

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
for my airport card,

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
which is unique to any Ethernet device.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Otherwise, I could've used the USB wireless card

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
from them or wireless the adapter, I guess.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So, I just get my MAC address and boom, you know,

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
free Wi-Fi, and it was cranking.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I downloaded hundreds of megabytes of podcasts

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
while I was awake, and while I was sleeping.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So, well worth the price of admission.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The room was good.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, the remote control wasn't quite bolted on to the nightstand.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So, in my book,

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
if you got a remote that's not bolted on,

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you're in a hotel that's good enough, you know,

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you got cold running water.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you got your Wi-Fi, which is really reliable,

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
then it's all a good thing.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And the return journey was just as beautiful,

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you know, got on the plane,

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
got to the airport a little bit early, had some dinner,

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
hopped on the plane, it left to the right on time.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's 7, you arrive at 7, then of course,

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
because it's, you know, about,

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
actually you're at the gate getting off at 7,

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
because the flight itself is only about 36,

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
37 minutes.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then guy waiting for me there,

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
hopped in the car,

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and 30 minutes later I was home.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was home before,

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
before was even 830.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So, perfect, absolutely perfect for the commute

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
back and forth to the Netherlands,

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
or any other part of the mainland for that reason.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, the reason I'm coming to you from the A8 studio today

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
is because it's just so much going on,

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and we just went to Christina's new school.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Actually, it's a school that we want to get her into,

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
so we had to, you know, kind of show up and say,

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
hey, you know, can we get this kid in?

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Admissions are a tough thing here in the UK,

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
particularly in public schools,

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
because, you know, full is full,

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and if they have no room,

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
then they just can't admit your child.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, seem like they were going to have a space for her.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In fact, I think I heard the headmaster say,

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
well, you know, once we do the admissions

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
a little talk there,

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and you feel like the paperwork,

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and now it's just needs really is uniform,

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and she's good to go.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's an old request.

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't want to play that, our shoot.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I wanted to play,

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
oh, man, I totally blew that.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's not what I want.

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Here's what I wanted to play for.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Silence, silence!

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm not that fit, but I'm afraid we'll go.org.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And you're listening to Adam Curry's Daily Source.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Bloody hell, not even.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sheep, half of the equipment.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There we go.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There you go.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There you feel my head that's just learned some public end up.

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Adam Curry's Daily Source code.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're not ready.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I love when people send me promos,

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and I love using them,

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
please continue to do that.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I go much, Todd.

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So the reason I'm in the A.A.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
is after, you know, we had to do the school thing,

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and that seems all cool.

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She's going to get in there.

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That was really much easier than I expected.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We even dressed up.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And we made Christina dressed up to look a little bit representative,

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and, you know, not her total gothic look.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That was a struggle this morning.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And so then I had to take the girls off to Sainsbury's,

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
which is the big shopping,

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you know, the big grocery store,

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
mega grocery store.

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And at three o'clock,

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the ladies have appointments,

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
oops, that's my recorder.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The ladies have appointments for their nails,

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and hair, and God knows what else.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And right now it's two o'clock.

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So I figured,

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
what I do is I just bring my kit with me.

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've got my 12 volt DC to AC power converter.

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I got all my stuff with me.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just, you know,

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
slide the chair back a little bit.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Keep the heater on.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You can probably hear kind of humming in the background.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I got my wireless love,

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
my hanging from the o' Jesus strap,

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
which is, you know,

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the thing you hold onto when you go on a sharp corner

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and say what Jesus.

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And so there it is.

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's just kind of dangling in front of me.

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And it's actually,

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I've mentioned this before.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The car is a great place.

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you're looking for a studio,

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
cars are a perfect place.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know,

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
to set up and get a nice quiet environment.

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He let me turn off the,

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
turn off the,

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
turn off the,

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the blower here.

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There we go.

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's better.

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's, you know,

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
why don't we just scan the,

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the FM dial for a second.

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, we're in the UK anyway.

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We're going to start off with,

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the BBC one at the top of the dial.

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay.

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So they're playing eagle eye cherry.

201
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Isn't it?

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's like that.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ready or two?

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Get off my line.

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Uh,

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that's really interesting.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Every ball day.

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And that was going to Virgin,

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Virgin F.

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And that was going to Virgin F.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know,

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
let's go to 96 for eagle.

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Whatever that is.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The first glasshead in Secretary.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Council leaders in the south.

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you still,

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
have only seen that concerns about plants about new houses.

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's go to BBC London.

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Whatever that is.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Today's weather patch.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You may be able to dial.

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It'll be bright.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The showers and the air.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,480
BBC SCR, this we're up to news now BBC Radio 3, Classical Station

229
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,560
Well that's that's what we just see finale, which part of the BBC Radio 4,

230
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:09,680
leisure and news, classic, classic FM, yes they're up here, they're definitely all in news

231
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,000
ring now, part of the BBC Radio 4, the latest show BBC Radio 4, British underwear model

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,200
Katrina Davis is taking it off, that's the kind of news we need, the rating after winning

233
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,560
through to the show's last three finalists, the 23 year old originally from Cardiff is the

234
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
only woman left in the show, which ends next week and has a 200,000 pounds of price, London's

235
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,240
weather, writing kind of the songs that even higher, okay now kiss 100, I'm just running

236
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:50,360
on the dial here, I have no idea or, and now we have LBC 97.3, jazz FM, we are definitely top of the

237
00:09:50,360 --> 00:10:02,360
hour in the news and magic FM, so there you go quick, quick scan around the FM dial here

238
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,760
in the UK, hello, this is top of the number of homo, some are still a dot net, music from

239
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,280
Germany, and you are listening to the daily source code with a podcast that he had a

240
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,960
curry, and have boiling, okay I wanted to make sure that you got Thomas's promo again

241
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,440
because last time I played something from some of the stellar dot net, I totally messed

242
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,860
up the URL, so now in the podcast production show notes, you can find the link to

243
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,220
Thomas Della dot net, which is German music, it's very cool, it's a great podcast, and

244
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,200
something that I think should definitely be added to the pod squad all in due time, more

245
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,340
about that in a second, first a little bit more about the UK, I want to thank you all so

246
00:10:50,340 --> 00:11:00,980
much for responding to my call to help about television systems, power plugs, and light

247
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:09,360
sockets, let me see Dave Raven, first of all this is interesting, Dave Raven said it wasn't

248
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,980
until he heard Patricia talking about Iván on backing vocals, that's Patricia's sister

249
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,820
that he connected, he said he interviewed Iván for BFBS code in Cologne, was BF British

250
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,100
Forces broadcasting I guess, in the early 80s, so he says he had the world is very, very small,

251
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,100
he says that your local TV shop will tweak your TVs to UK standard, that I didn't

252
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,740
know, that's cool, also you can buy ES bulbs of all types, so you can keep your lamps,

253
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,580
and apparently we just didn't go to the right, do it yourself hardware store, now check

254
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,580
this out, he says why the funny plugs bulbs and TV, well here it comes, and this always

255
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:54,740
emases me, and I keep noticing on television and in newspapers that a lot of things

256
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,180
that you think might be American inventions or maybe the Germans think they invented it

257
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,300
or the Japanese think they invented it, British have their own thoughts about who invented

258
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,380
what, oh hold on that's the traffic report wailing through, here we go, low-key

259
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,860
bird, L-O-G-I-E, so I guess it's low-G- or low-key bird, invented the television, his

260
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,660
nationality was British, so I guess that's why they get to put the audio frequency wherever

261
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,540
they want, I did not know that, I thought it was like, you know, Mr. Xeneth, who invented

262
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:35,300
the television, Joseph Swan demonstrated the electric light a year before Edison, nationality,

263
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,220
British, so I guess that means he gets to put fucked up bayonet, connectors on it, if you

264
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,660
want, but that's amazing, I never heard about Joseph Swan, that he demonstrated the electric

265
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,100
light a year before Edison, then how come Edison gets all the credit or is that only in the

266
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,740
states that he gets all the credit? William Gilbert coined the word electricity, nationality,

267
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,780
British, now what I remember from my history lessons, didn't Benjamin Franklin, this is the way

268
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,220
Americans learned about the discovery of electricity, Benjamin Franklin was flying a kite with a

269
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,420
wire on it with a key at the end, and he got electrocuted when lightning struck his kite during

270
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,940
a storm, and that apparently is when he went, well, Boeing electricity, apparently not,

271
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,980
well, I have to take it from Dave that William Gilbert coined the word electricity, and then he

272
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,540
winds up by saying, UK Boeing over, and regards Dave, excellent Dave, thank you very much,

273
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,820
let me see, there's a couple more emails that got here, Mike from Holland says, hi Adam, welcome to

274
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,820
UK, congratulations on the culture show, peace, short of general, I love publicity for podcasting,

275
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,820
boo, oh, here's one about plug TV systems, here's one for you, can you explain, oh, this is a good one,

276
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,100
he says, can you explain, well, all electric sockets in the Netherlands are halfway up the wall,

277
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,180
that's always puzzling me, why not have them at floor level like over here, so they're not so obvious,

278
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,300
okay, very good question, that is something we noticed as well, and I believe it's twofold,

279
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,140
one is it was safety for children, kind of like the way I guess UK has switched next to every single

280
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,220
electrical outlet that they have, which is probably also a safety thing as well, but I also believe,

281
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,460
because most of the Netherlands is several feet under below sea level, thus underwater,

282
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,500
flooding certainly occurred back in the day, and yeah, when flooding occurred, you know, you want to have

283
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,420
a little bit of space there before it hits the electrical sockets, that's the only answer I've

284
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,940
ever heard, it may not be the correct one, there's something else if you ever come to the

285
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,860
Netherlands, you may notice that the toilets in Holland don't just have like a hole down into water,

286
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:50,700
they have a shelf, there's an actual shelf, and you know, stuff just kind of sits there until

287
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,860
you flush it, and I remember moving to the Netherlands and inquiring about that thinking was very

288
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:04,540
weird, and the way that happened is that the first toilets were made for hospitals, and the same

289
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:11,020
company that made the toilets for hospitals basically just continue to make them for for domestic

290
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,140
use for people's homes, and in a hospital it's quite handy to have a little shelf there to check

291
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,380
some stuff out, and that's the story behind that, hey, I'm almost as good as Patricia with

292
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,540
a Stevie next stuff, aren't I? Now, one more TV solutions, where do we have here, this is from Toby

293
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,420
Jeffy, oh yeah, he said something, okay, so here's the actual technical deal with the televisions,

294
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,060
reason you can't hear the UK audio on your TV is that the rest of Europe uses PAL GPH for

295
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,620
UHF, which is a 5.5 megahertz audio offset, whereas the UK South Africa, Ireland and the Hong Kong

296
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:51,660
used PAL I, which is a six megahertz offset for the audio, not sure what PAL does this, or PAL I does this,

297
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,500
but basically means that the RF reception is going to, you're going to not going to hear the audio,

298
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,540
one way around it, and this is something that I actually thought about myself, is if you get a free

299
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,380
view box, which I told you about, the stuff that pulls digital channels out of thin air,

300
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,540
you can use this scarred, and I do believe that the scarred is just a pure audio and video in the

301
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,780
start, the scarred connector when those broad, multi-prong connectors, so I'm hoping that once we

302
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,700
get our credit cards and either UK issued credit card to get sky, to get the sky satellite system,

303
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,660
and then I'll be able to connect a couple of TVs up using the set top box going directly to the

304
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:36,140
scarred to the scarred connector. So that's it about that for the, then that's also minor really

305
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,620
when all things considered is not bad at all, and we're fitting in quite perfectly, even with

306
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,380
the small, you know, these small little differences. Ross Jones sent me a link, which I actually

307
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,700
posted on my weblog, another link in the production show notes for today's Daily Source Code,

308
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:03,100
that the BBC is doing a show on radio six tomorrow about the ever so popular, quote, unquote,

309
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,380
podcasting, so I'll be sure to, hopefully get a recording of that, or at least be able to

310
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,420
listen to it and report back on what the BBC is doing with that. Again, the BBC is really

311
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,180
getting into into podcasting. I can feel it. There's no like official sanctioned, you know,

312
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,700
really yet, but I know the technicians are all over it, and I know a lot of the people who are

313
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,380
who are presenters and producers are still, you know, very interested in doing whatever they can with

314
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:35,980
podcasting. Along the lines of the culture show that aired last week, Stuart Hunter has also posted

315
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,460
an MPEG version of the podcasting segment for all of you who are having problems with the MP4 version,

316
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,300
and he's placed that as a bit torrent. Again, that URL available from the pod show production notes

317
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,540
for today's Daily Source Code. Let's get another little promo here. Hello everybody,

318
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,420
different lines, the digital man from the digital experience podcast. I want to invite all of you

319
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,220
to check us out. Our weekly podcast includes non-real music, news and information, podcast reviews,

320
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,220
and upfront political talks with Dan and Craig. We're kind of like Adam Curry,

321
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,740
only we never lived in a castle. We drive on the right side of the road,

322
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,060
and there are very few. So check out the weekly digital experience podcast,

323
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:34,060
only at lands.pfil.com. All righty. Gotta say I'm hearing more everybody's popping up every single day,

324
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,460
and that's actually the cover real all requests that I played by accident earlier in the show.

325
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,660
Check it out. Just listen to how people are saying every body. It's an all-request Sunday on cover

326
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:54,380
ville, everybody. By the way, I totally love the Beatles coverville, which was the Thanksgiving

327
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,980
version. Man, that kicks so much ass. It was wonderful to hear. I suggest you check that out if you

328
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,460
haven't yet. Great stories, great versions by other artists, and it came right after I was watching

329
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,060
this wonderful BBC program, which I'll also put a link to on the on the podcast show notes.

330
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,780
A couple of years back, someone found an old analog portable jute box that belonged to John

331
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,300
Lennon. I think they found it in an auction. So it's literally, it's like a case, you open this

332
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:36,700
case up, and in it is a whole mechanism, plus these 45 RPM vinyl singles, and it was his personal

333
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,020
jute box. And he'd filled it up with, so kind of like the the iPod of the day, right?

334
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:49,260
And it was found intact with all the original 45s that John Lennon put there in there himself,

335
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,620
written down a couple of been changed around. And basically what they did is they took this jute box

336
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:01,820
and went to all the people who songs were in it. And it was amazing. I mean, they also took

337
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,860
the people who a couple people who weren't in it, but so like sting for instance. But they,

338
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,500
you know, they found all these old blues artists and singers. And it was, you know, I'll put a link

339
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,020
to the show. I don't know if there's any video available, but it was a fabulous, fabulous show.

340
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,700
Again, just, and it wasn't even the BBC. I think it was ITV actually, one of the,

341
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,260
one of the commercial stations. It was just a great, great show. I wonder if it was, it looked like

342
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,500
was it was all English names on the credit. So I guess it was a UK production. I have no idea if

343
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,380
it's new or if it was repeat or if it's ever aired anywhere. But I was, yeah, I was totally amazed

344
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,060
by that. And then, but on the heels of that to hear the coverville, the coverville of the Beatles

345
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:52,380
was absolutely fantastic. Just beautiful. Let's see, what did we want to handle today? A couple

346
00:20:52,380 --> 00:21:03,580
more plugs. What is this UPEI? Okay. Justin, Doran. Can't stop listening to your show. Good stuff.

347
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,260
Just wanted to let you know. I'm starting a new university web radio station podcasting service

348
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,220
over here. The University of Prince Edward Island in Canada. Your show provides a lot of inspiration

349
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:19,740
for it. And he had links to, did I just play that promo? I'll put the email in the, in the

350
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,380
show notes. A little discombobulated today, sitting in the car trying to do this. And also Studio Geek

351
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,780
another podcast you want to check out with an RIA free podcast, which I heard someone the other

352
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,740
day say, RIA. Maybe that's the way we should just categorize it. RIA. It's the, instead of RIA,

353
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,940
just say, RIA. I think that's probably the best way to go. Want to give a little attention

354
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:50,780
to the new sports node on the iPodor.org directory. And I kind of messed it up. I was talking

355
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:58,540
about the, what is it? The, the, the skinny on sports podcast. And I'd confuse it, the skinny on

356
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:06,780
sports podcast with Curtis, who is actually, does the sports pod at the sports pod.com. And Curtis

357
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,380
is actually the person who has been working with me for the past two weeks trying to get an

358
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,340
OPML file just right so that we can get it into the directory. And it was a real, I mean,

359
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,140
it was just like giving birth. And even though I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes

360
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,580
to that, it was really painful. So we finally got it to work. It's up and running. And Curtis

361
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,260
is actually going to write up a little document to assist people when they get into the loop that

362
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,140
we got into with, with trying to get the right OPML just, you know, just perfect so that the

363
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:43,500
directory would parse it all. So apologies there. The skinny on sports is of course now listed

364
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,100
in the, in the directory, but it's really Curtis who's maintaining this and he's got all kinds

365
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:57,580
of sports podcasts. Check out the sports, what is it? The sports, the sports pod, sports pod.com.

366
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:05,820
Again, all information linked into the appropriate places, of course, from the iPodor.org directory.

367
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:15,180
And we're working on a lot of OPML stuff. Droo from Don and Drew has also gotten the OPML bug.

368
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,060
And I think what's going to happen pretty soon is this whole concept of the pod squad,

369
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,860
which essentially is, oh, I eight or nine podcasts that just, you know, are my favorites.

370
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,940
We're going to start linking those together and, and, and really having a lot of the information

371
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,300
flow from one to the next and also make it easy for people to subscribe to an entire,

372
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,460
basically a station or a network in one go. So just here's one file, drag it into your iPodor

373
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,660
and boom, you're subscribed. And it should also maybe put them into a separate, I'm thinking,

374
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,380
I don't know, maybe we should put them into a separate playlist on your MP3 player.

375
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,860
Not quite sure yet, but a big part of that is going to be these production notes and how we flow

376
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,180
things from, from one podcast to the next. And maybe how we can, you know, all together, you know,

377
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,420
as a, as a group, as a pod squad, maybe we can figure out how to promote certain songs together,

378
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,420
or who knows? But it's definitely high on the radar for getting stuff rolling.

379
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:19,660
As is the bit torrent method of distribution, boy, this has been a big thing on the mailing lists.

380
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,460
And unfortunately, too many private emails over the past week, which I think we've kind of

381
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:30,300
gotten out of the private email circuit by now. But Dave Winner and I co-authored,

382
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,780
where I think it's just going to be the simplest way to get an alternative form of distribution

383
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,300
for podcasters who, you know, are trying to figure out a way of distributing their podcasters,

384
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,980
more efficiently than just putting an MP3 up and letting everyone hammer the MP3 file directly.

385
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,180
So we've come up with a bit torrent name space for RSS. And it's really simple. All it solves is

386
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,300
one thing. And that's what I like about it. It just gives you a way to add an alternative

387
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,060
download location and download method specifically for a bit torrent. It's not trying to solve

388
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,420
anything else than that, which is why I like it because RSS is supposed to be simple. So the next

389
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,940
thing we'll be working on, I think, is this OPML. Of course, we're going to figure out, you know,

390
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,380
I don't know if there should be an OPML namespace or whatever. In fact, I've just looking at RSS

391
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:28,860
an OPML, both in an outliner. I'm trying to think how can we connect those two, but I'm not sure yet.

392
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,940
And hey, it's only Monday. Damn. This is the brain's work in a way too hard.

393
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:42,460
It's not often that I come across something from Andrew Grummett's feeds. I'm subscribed to a

394
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:49,420
couple of different RSS feeds that he has with the RSS 2.0 and in closures. And something finally

395
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,060
came across the wire off of Andrew Grummett's, I guess this is podcast feed. And it was so cute.

396
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,100
It took me a while that it took me two plays actually to figure out what was going on.

397
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,940
But this is, it's he came through as, see, was it categorized as the Grummett family players

398
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,940
from Andrew Grummett's audio weblog. The tune is Freddie Freeloader and I guess this

399
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,060
um, I'm going to kid shoot see a nine mile online here in the car. I'm thinking it's Andrew

400
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:25,020
of one kid or two. I think he has one child. So I think that the deal is Andrew is kind of doing

401
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,380
the melody and then his child is blowing on whatever he's blowing on.

402
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,900
