1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Lays there began as you reach Web Chapel.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There were tons of hits shut out of your text.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Your final score last night at 9.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
First on 635 OVJ.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
To Pete.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, Justin.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's Adam Curry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Adam Curry.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thursday the 30th of December.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey, do you hear that?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That was like an official pukered radio voice.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, everybody.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I am doing welcome to the Daily Source Code.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It is Thursday, December 30th, 2004.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Almost at the end of the year.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yet again, 40 minutes of users and developers partying together on MP3.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The power of the Lord is the Lord.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What are you partying together on MP3?

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In MP3 on MP3 with MP3?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
God knows.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome readers of BBC's website or the Boston Phoenix.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You may have happened upon this program or podcasting.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thanks to one of those two articles.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Daily Source Code.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where I am, the effort is so little podcasting.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Everybody now.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So that means we got promos.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We got potsafe music on the way.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We got some mashups.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We've got new podcasts.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And of course.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Fun.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Actually, what I wanted to say was, of course, we got some countdown, right?

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's something about, you know, that this, and we've played the sign-in-out live Cowball,

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Skit.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A number of times on this show and people have commented on it.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But that's really quite a cult following a, about this whole Christopher Walken.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I mean, Bruce Dickinson Cowbell thing.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I dig it.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I totally dig it.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, once again, some techy stuff to talk about.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But really, I'd say there is no source code that can really,

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
100% complete without a drum cadence.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Indeed.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Today's drum cadence comes from our drum, aficionado extraordinaire Joe Husky.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Here's the friend's drum cadence from the movie Drumline.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Enjoy this.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's about four minutes if you want to skip past that.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I would suggest checking it out.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000

180
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
what the heck is this?

181
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's addictive.

182
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's drum cadence stuff.

183
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It really is.

184
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know, I'm still looking for more hits.

185
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
More big hits done by high school bands, college bands, professional bands.

186
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I think we should make a whole podcast just out of drum cadence.

187
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There's clearly an enormous community.

188
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm getting more drum cadence and B3 sent to me than rock and roll.

189
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Either the community is tighter.

190
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The community is more active or there's just more of it.

191
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But when you think about it, every single school has some form of a band.

192
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's pretty easy to record these things.

193
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's get some hits going.

194
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think it's addictive.

195
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When I'm walking, I love listening to good drum cadence.

196
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't help it.

197
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It just helps me out.

198
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And of course, the great thing about podcasts is that if you don't dig it, just skip ahead.

199
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's why I told you about three minutes skip ahead.

200
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Actually, this was supposed to be four minutes.

201
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll just let it wind up here.

202
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's hear how it ends.

203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's a classic drum battle.

204
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
End of show.

205
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You know, we have this sky television set up, which is satellite, which is, I guess, analogous to.

206
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Actually, it's kind of like direct TV and TV.

207
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Put into one, because you can pause live TV.

208
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can record multiple shows.

209
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The whole thing.

210
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It has the guide.

211
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What it doesn't do is it doesn't give you the suggestions that the TV does.

212
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
On the second we just do our little latency thing.

213
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

214
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's better.

215
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
More about the latency later on the show.

216
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I think it's, is an MSNBC.

217
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe it's one of the multiple sky channels to every night, every weekday night.

218
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think at one thirty AM, David Letterman is on.

219
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I love David Letterman.

220
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I also, you know, there's also the late show errors on MSNBC and the weekend.

221
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So I don't really know if there's a, or the tonight show with Jay Leno.

222
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the late show would let him in errors every weekday night.

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And because of the sky box, you can basically subscribe to the show.

224
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So that's why I don't even know what network it's on.

225
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm subscribed to David Letterman.

226
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So it's sitting there waiting for me.

227
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it has little info button.

228
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And it can tell you look at your recorded shows and it tells you which guests were on.

229
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's like the show notes.

230
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I saw that Howard Stern was on.

231
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I guess he was on probably last week, just before Christmas.

232
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So there's a two or three day delay.

233
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And when they re-are them, or they broadcast them here in Europe in the UK.

234
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And Stern, of course, was on talking about his move to serious radio from traditional broadcasting from,

235
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think he's still with infinity.

236
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Isn't he?

237
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Infinity or did he move?

238
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, anyway.

239
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Doesn't matter.

240
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's going from traditional broadcast over to a subscription model.

241
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I say subscription model specifically because podcasting is the same thing.

242
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's a subscription model.

243
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Do not let the word subscription freak you out because you don't have to pay anything for the subscription.

244
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you are basically subscribed.

245
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And it was great.

246
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I mean, it was really wonderful because, and I, and I, and I still recorded.

247
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And now, of course, I have to figure out how to get that off of my, my sky box.

248
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I guess I could Jerry rig up the audio somehow.

249
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Maybe I'll just hold up an MP3 recorded in front of the TV.

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But I do want to let you hear a couple of excerpts from that.

251
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And maybe someone else recorded, they can hack it up for me.

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because he was talking about all the same reasons why podcasting is as exploded.

253
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But more from a broadcaster standpoint.

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was really interesting.

255
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But here's where it got kind of sad.

256
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Because he can't make his move until 2006.

257
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That means there's a whole year, a whole year, right?

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where in a lot of shit can happen in a whole year.

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Look at how fast podcasting took off.

260
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You know, just a couple months.

261
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Of course, it'd been brewing for years.

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But you get, you get my, my drift there.

263
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And he can't really talk about, and he can't promote the subscription nature of the service that he's moving to on his own radio show.

264
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Which is just one of the many things he can't talk about.

265
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, you know, it's, it's a, it's very frustrating for him.

266
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sure.

267
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, if I just compile all the data in my head and I didn't take notes, but I did watch very closely.

268
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And Patricia was sitting on the couch next to me, by the way, saying,

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
God damn, he'd be perfect for podcasting, like, uh-huh.

270
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And in fact, he's doing that.

271
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's moving over to a podcast model, a subscription model.

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I potter kind of model, although it's not.

273
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because serious radio will still be live radio.

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
When Howard Stern is broadcasting, less it's a best of, it'll be broadcast live,

275
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and you'll have to be in your car at that moment to receive it.

276
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I specifically say, car, because that's pretty much where serious works the best right now.

277
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And this was one of the sad things is that besides the fact that Howard, for the next year,

278
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
will have to go on all kinds of external media, which he always, you know,

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
didn't do.

280
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He refused to do interviews except for David Letterman, of course, and the odd line of appearance.

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And of course, he, he'd do appearances, but he'd like to pick and choose him.

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And now I think he, you know, part of the deal is that he does have to promote this.

283
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's trying to get people to subscribe to serious radio, uh, this Christmas season.

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't know if that helped or not.

285
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They have about 750,000 subscribers.

286
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And what he did, and this is the part that really freaked me out.

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He said, you know, I brought something day.

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is for you, because serious is not just for the car anymore.

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's also for at home.

290
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And he, and he picks up from behind the chair.

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This blue boom box.

292
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It could have been made by Philips.

293
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I swear to God, it was so freaking ugly.

294
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Um, with, you know, the two round speakers had a little bow on it.

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And he says, this is it.

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You know, you can receive serious radio in your, uh, in your kitchen or in your living room.

297
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Like my god, the man actually has to sell the freaking boxes.

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is sad.

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And Patricia said, and this was what I, I love her so much.

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
She said, but, you know, well, why doesn't he just use the iPods?

301
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I mean, there's millions of iPods.

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She said, it's a yep, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo.

303
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of course, um, I'm not offering him $500 million for a five-year contract.

304
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yet.

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yet.

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I say yet.

307
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But if you look at it, 750,000 subscriptions.

308
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And I'm sure that of the 15 million listeners, um, he reaches.

309
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know if he actually has 15 million listeners, but his audience is, uh, at least,

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
well, maybe it is 15 million.

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It wouldn't surprise me.

312
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That actually, that, that probably sounds about right 15 million listeners.

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, let's say that he has 15 million listeners.

314
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I bet you of those 15 million listeners, a large, um, segment probably has an MP3 player.

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I think that, you know, what was he talking about?

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He was saying 40 cents a day gets you serious radio.

317
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And that's probably about right if you, if you work it out to a monthly payment.

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And he said, he's Hawking all this, right?

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's basically doing a QVC on Letterman.

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I think in myself, man, I would pay 40 cents a day just to Howard for only a Howard

321
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Seren podcast.

322
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And it's funny because when I just started out with OnRent, my company in New York,

323
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
which later, uh, went on to become thinking of ideas and what she took public.

324
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Um, I remember calling Don Buckwell.

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I think it's Don Buckwell.

326
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
His, uh, his manager is consultant, etc.

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I said, look, um, yeah, of course he, he took my call in New, uh,

328
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
it was.

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I said, you know, the internet is where it's going to be.

330
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's going.

331
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is perfect for Howard.

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No restrictions.

333
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And basically, I got the gruff answer, like, you know,

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
we're not interested in internet and, you know, unless we make money off it.

335
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Which is completely fair.

336
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think that time is coming.

337
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And we need a Howard Stern.

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We really do need a Howard Stern to come over to our side.

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Um, and it's too bad he didn't do it.

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Uh, I can't blame him again for the, you know, for that offer.

341
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know if the, if the, if the offer will remain open for the next year,

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
if we can still come in with a different offer.

343
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't even know if it's actually 500 million in cash.

344
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Somehow I doubt it's going to be 500 million cash.

345
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's probably a combination of stock and options and, uh,

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
based upon upside and future results and stuff like that.

347
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Doesn't matter.

348
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think Howard has enough money, uh, to live comfortably, um,

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
but he deserves to get paid for it.

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Whatever he does.

351
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But I think there will be more options.

352
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There's going to be more media companies that will be interested in, um,

353
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
um, in that kind of talent.

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And it may not be Howard Stern, maybe there's a young Stern out there,

355
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
that people will gladly pay money for to subscribe to a podcast,

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
or maybe we can work out some advertising or maybe not at all.

357
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Maybe someone will just do it just because it's fucking fun.

358
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Kind of like what we're doing.

359
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So, um, I will get some of those experts.

360
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If, if you recorded that, if you have it at home,

361
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
uh, hack it up, put it into MP3, please let me know before I go and,

362
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and start streaming wires throughout the cottage,

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
which gets Patricia so incredibly pissed off.

364
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And of course, after I usually do that, then nothing works anymore, right?

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
13 minutes into your daily source code.

366
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Um, this is today's source code is sampled at 44.1 kilohertz,

367
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
which is the original sample rate.

368
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We've been talking about this yesterday's was, uh,

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I forced it with the new with the lame brain filters.

370
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you remember yesterday's show,

371
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to go through it, uh, 22.05.

372
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, kilohertz sample.

373
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Um, which was a little lower on quality, I fell.

374
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, and the file size, it was only like a meg difference, I think.

375
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you, you know, normally it's about 19 megs for a 40,

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
19 and a half to 20 megs for a 40 minute show,

377
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and yesterday's like 18 and a half.

378
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So, it didn't make a lot of difference.

379
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, what I'm doing now, uh, today's show is compresses 44.1.

380
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So, the file size will be bigger.

381
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What I put in the production show notes is an excellent comment by, uh,

382
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
FLEB, uh, no other identification for FLEB.

383
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But really, uh, goes into great detail about the MP3 wobbling

384
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
about the sample rates, about the bit rates.

385
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Um, I put it in the show notes because it's way too complicated to discuss,

386
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
uh, just me to, to pair it back for you or to, or to read it.

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But it is, if you want to know what this is all about,

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and you want to know, um, what, what the difference certain settings

389
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
make, please go look at the show notes for today.

390
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And, um, working with the, uh, with Drew and, uh, with Dave,

391
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
had another great chat with Dave last night on, you know,

392
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
how we can best, um, put these show notes out there, you know,

393
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and what should we make, uh, what should we make, uh, a podcast,

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you know, post look like I guess.

395
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
All stuff that we're working on.

396
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
All stuff we're working on.

397
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Um, the Asian crisis.

398
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Can't talk about that enough.

399
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Um, last night, Patricia and I, uh, after we were done,

400
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
did I already tell you about this?

401
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Was it last night?

402
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was it.

403
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I remember I told Dave about it that you were sitting in the kitchen

404
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and the radio was on.

405
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And, of course, we have perfect lighting in the cottage, right?

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Everything's on dimmers, which I installed myself, by the way.

407
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um, and so the lighting is nice.

408
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's just like a movie set.

409
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
My life is like a movie set.

410
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I got to tell you this.

411
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is totally what Patricia does.

412
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
She always says, women above 50 have to have dimmers.

413
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We need special lighting to look good.

414
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Men above 42, I got news for you.

415
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So, and we have the radio on or the wireless, as it's still known here in the UK.

416
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And people do listen to the wireless quite a bit, which is, you know,

417
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
is nice.

418
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
People really like their radio and the, and the talk shows.

419
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And the news came through and it was just like we were in a fricking movie with like

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Will Smith, you know, or, or, or, um,

421
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What's this name?

422
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Bruce Willis.

423
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, here on the radio, 100,000 people perished.

424
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And like, Jesus Christ, you know, what is this?

425
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What, what has been happening?

426
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How, how did we get to this point?

427
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And Michael Lopez sent me an email, said,

428
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Maybe we need to come up with some kind of emergency pod system, pod cast system.

429
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It says, we need one.

430
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Maybe it would be checked every five or ten minutes instead of twice or thrice daily.

431
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Could warn you of upcoming catastrophes like the tsunami and save lives.

432
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't, I don't know.

433
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't think that's going to work just with the pure time shift of what we're doing.

434
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In fact, whenever, um, if I'm ever asked in an interview, you know,

435
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So, well, because that's one thing reporters and journalists always will say,

436
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's like, well, you know, but your news is always going to be a day late.

437
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And usually, I say, yeah, if we find Osama bin Laden,

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Please don't go running to your iPod because you probably won't get the news there immediately.

439
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
In fact, I think weblogs will be much, much, much better for that.

440
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But the answer, I think, to the, to the whole idea of EPS is that RSS,

441
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
really simple syndication, which is, you know, the foundation of what,

442
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What this distribution is all based on,

443
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
is that is the answer to an early warning system like that.

444
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Absolutely, absolutely. And that's, and I'm sure that there's stuff out there already.

445
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I know there's the Amber Alert, which I subscribe to.

446
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Um, we, uh, we blogged about that a while ago, which is missing kids.

447
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Um, and I, it's like the milk carton. It's like the virtual milk carton.

448
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It comes through every single day.

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And what I like about the Amber Alert is they also, uh,

450
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Post when the kids have been found. You know, it's not just the horrible news

451
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
in kids we can't find them. It's also, hey, guess what?

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That kid that was missing found the kid is alive, all as well.

453
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is the sound of the day.

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
To sound of the day for today, you.

455
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And that was the sound of the day.

456
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Toon in again tomorrow for the sound of the day.

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And my Bob, uh.

458
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
All right. This comes from openpodcast.org.

459
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And, um, if you've never checked out openpodcast.org or if you're new to podcasting

460
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and want to get your feet wet, this is an excellent way to do it. Openpodcast.org.

461
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's you call in through a phone number or email an MP3 file or just email a link

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to an MP3 file. The, I mean, the interface is actually it's wonderful for newbies.

463
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If you don't know how to do an RSS feed and you just want to get stuff out there.

464
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Um, you, it's open. That's the whole point.

465
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And, um, it's just a great place to get stuff, um, played.

466
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Uh, it doesn't have a hell of a lot of subscribers I saw today.

467
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Only like three or 400 people who subscribe to the feed, but I'm one of them.

468
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And, uh, I used to get the, uh, podcast or tap dancing news off of that all the one second.

469
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Um, also, uh, well, there's a number of things that you used to get from that feed.

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I haven't, uh, really, and it's something that the Dave said.

471
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He said, you know, um, I miss some things in your show, and I think it's because of the bandwidth.

472
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And yes, of course, bandwidth is, is a problem, although, you know,

473
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I've been solving it and been learning a lot and the problem will eventually go away.

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Um, but, uh, openpodcast, I don't know, I just, I just want to make sure you know about it.

475
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because that's, if you want to just send something out there, get some creativity flowing,

476
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and people will definitely respond to you.

477
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And, uh, it's also a good place to send stuff for me to listen to because I'm back on it.

478
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm re-subscribed, um, and it's, uh, and I'm all caught up.

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So now whenever something new comes through openpodcast.org, I'll definitely, uh, catch it.

480
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So it's a, it's a good way to, to get your podcast chops down if, uh, if you should so wish.

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Um, let's see. Oh, of course, a news, uh, Ken and Squip show is, uh, is out.

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And, as usual, Ken has built a little promo for it.

483
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hello, this is Kenster J from the Ken and Squip show.

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Please join us this week as Squip and I take to the skies over Manhattan for our first,

485
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and most likely last annual Ken and Squip show toy drop.

486
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're just flying past some place on the upper west side of Manhattan,

487
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
not far from the Ken and Squip broadcast plaza.

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Is that a goat I see on the roof?

489
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's Donald Trump.

490
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, the Donald high, everybody wave.

491
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Wait, don't everybody move to one side at once.

492
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Ken is on the left side of the chopper throwing out presents.

493
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I've got a CD player right here.

494
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm about to let go.

495
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And, and all sorts of gifts like I'd like to.

496
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And there it goes.

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Wait, the shoots.

498
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh, the shoots not opening on that one.

499
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Look out.

500
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No.

501
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh.

502
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Ouch.

503
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That probably hurt safely back in the ground.

504
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I asked Squip to reflect back on her holiday.

505
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
How is your holiday?

506
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then we discuss how to handle that awkward situation that happens when someone gives you a horrible gift.

507
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Then it had this thing hanging off the end of it.

508
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It looked like a pork chop.

509
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, I said, hmm, where did you get that?

510
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I can return it and get the gas.

511
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We also offer up in your reverent review of the very latest in religious soft toys.

512
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It, it, it hugging Jesus.com.

513
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Christ, I hate to give them a plug.

514
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Now, first of all, it looks like a piece of roadkill.

515
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It looks like pancake Jesus.

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's the ugliest piece of shit that I've ever seen in my life.

517
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Spread the love of Christ today.

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I could just throw up.

519
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And Squip and I finally error differences over the official Ken and Squip show cock.

520
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We still haven't ever resolved our dispute over the cock though.

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
One of these days, we're going to have to have a cock off on the air.

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, people can vote for cock number one or cock number two.

523
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's the only time she's ever really gotten mad at me ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It was over that damned cock.

525
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I really liked my cock and you took it away.

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
No, because you'll note I didn't take it away.

527
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It was in the last show and my cock was in the show before that.

528
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Ken?

529
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That didn't sound right at all.

530
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Plus, as always, we feature a great new band.

531
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All of this and more are in this week's Ken and Squip show.

532
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's available at www.dustingmybrain.com slash k-a-s-s-s.

533
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, right.

534
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The casting may never be the same.

535
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's right.

536
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Ken and Squip show.

537
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
These are the two folks that used to work with me at my company.

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's just, I love hearing them.

539
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
All though, Ken, make the promo a little shorter.

540
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay, try and make it one minute.

541
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This is valuable source code time, ever rainbow day.

542
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000

543
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000

I never used to go away

594
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,500
But I was like that, it's great

595
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,500
But I never used to go away

596
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
But I never used to go away

597
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,500
But I never used to go away

598
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
But I never used to go away

599
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,500
But I never used to go away

600
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,500
I never used to go away

601
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:04,500
I never used to go away

602
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:16,500
But I never used to go away

603
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,420
of medley damn that was good I love that that's actually that's probably a three or four

604
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:31,140
boinger isn't it it's like a lot of response to little talk we had about Firefox the new

605
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,660
browser from the Mozilla Foundation I guess is that from the Mozilla Foundation what's the

606
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,420
open source browser and now I know how to scroll all the way to the top of the bottom of the

607
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:49,300
page so if you want to go up or down one page if you're on like a big scrolling web page it's

608
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:56,500
the hold on it's on your power book it's function or on your regular key it's the control key I guess

609
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:04,020
CTRL key so arrow upper hour arrow down gives you one page if you do arrow left arrow right

610
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,260
that'll take you to the top of the page all the way to the bottom of the page so now I just need to find

611
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:17,700
out how I can actually what keyboard shortcuts can rotate through the different tabs okay and also

612
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:24,340
people are now downloading the Firefox the optimized Firefox for G4 G5 Max whoa

613
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:31,540
got a lot a lot of real happy people on that one man I'll tell you it's fast it's a good

614
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,740
browser I'm liking it the thing I don't like of course as I have to reenter all the the form

615
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,460
automated fill-in forms I love having that I use that all the time because I subscribe to stuff

616
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,180
all the time with different names and numbers and data whatever and of course having to

617
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,620
re-subscribe to all the sites that that I had password username pairs for but it's worth it

618
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,700
I'm doing it and also thank you by the way for explaining how to import the bookmarks it's so far

619
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,820
you guys have been really helped me out I really appreciate it and a more good news remember I told you

620
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,420
that it seemed like David fixed his recording problem and it turned out it was the I think it's

621
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:15,540
called replay radio that that he had installed which essentially records streams off of

622
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:22,900
known programs predominantly NPR programs and turns those into MP3's I guess and puts him on your

623
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,060
drive for kind of like an iPod or you know so you can listen to him later it's a it's a time

624
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,820
shifter and he had recorded the world where the clerk boy did an interview with me at the star

625
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,660
bucks in gilford and it had the same kind of gaps that people had noticed on his podcast and so

626
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,220
that led him to pretty much discover that this was the problem and he uninstalled and I think he's

627
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,380
fixed it but then he went on and did this awesome test while he was an amerala Texas and I knew

628
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,540
he was going to amerala could I told him a couple days ago because he calls me on the road you know so it's

629
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:58,500
around 2 p.m. and it's later at night here and we're talking and it's great the GSM connectivity

630
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,540
is fricking awesome you know it's just he drives and we talk and it's the connection is great

631
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:11,060
and it's actually cheaper for me to call Dave in Texas from cell phone to cell phone that it is

632
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,940
for me to call a landline in the Netherlands just want you to know that so anyway I said you know

633
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,140
I've been to amerala Texas I think I was there once when I was promoting my syndicated countdown

634
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:29,620
radio show that Adam Curry's top 30 hit list and so the way that worked is you go to all these

635
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:34,420
top 40 radio stations and if I made an appearance then they would run my show and basically they'd

636
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,860
run my show for free but of course I would sell national commercials because it was on an x number of

637
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,660
stations and I don't remember what the top 40 station was in amerala Texas but I do remember they took

638
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,740
me the DJs and the program director because this happened every single town too it was like hey

639
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:55,460
come on man I'm going to go take yad to strip joy man it's always cougars or cheetahs or you know whenever

640
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,180
I said today I said I know there's an awesome strip barn amerala Texas with tumble weeds like rolling

641
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,660
outside but it's it's a lot of fun on the inside and he took that to hard I guess in his test

642
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:13,300
of his new setup this is a test I am I'm using let's see so first he's going to talk about what he

643
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,380
fixed which is actually pretty important stuff because that was you know it's a bug it's a

644
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,140
fucking bug in this replay radio software I guess you might Sony laptop which is the computer that I

645
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,460
have out and ready to use all the way isn't it nice to hear Dave with a normal voice again and so

646
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,540
that Hawking squeaky Brady bunch like voice change thing and it's nice to hear this way amiga

647
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:44,980
I'm driving and frankly if I can get this thing to do the to you know record stuff then

648
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,140
that I'm going to be able to do more podcasts while I'm on the road which I will be on the road

649
00:30:52,660 --> 00:31:01,380
excuse me for at least like the next two weeks maybe three weeks so it's a good thing to sort of

650
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:13,940
figure out and I had a it was interesting when I recorded when Adam was on the the world with BBC

651
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:24,660
I recorded that on this laptop using replay radio and everybody said that it had the the gaps you

652
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:32,420
know sort of the breaks that that are typical of this computer when it does it's recordings and

653
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:41,380
I thought well maybe the problem is the uh maybe the problem is the um the replay radio stuff

654
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,020
uh yeah exactly so then Dave goes on to read like local literature exotic dancers

655
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:56,420
sweet and personal escort for all okay hmm hmm okay how about some she males days here's

656
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:03,620
best rate escort they might have some sweet yeah they have celebrity look like males wait is there an

657
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:11,140
Adam curry for rent yeah that I just did that oh okay well shelly this sweet and personal it's just

658
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,780
if you haven't heard this you've gotta go listen to it it's uh it's probably still uh in the RSS

659
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,500
if not because scroll back to like yesterday on scripting news it's hilarious you got to listen to the

660
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,180
whole thing and I think we should have a podcast about escorts and strip bars in different towns you know

661
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,780
if you're going somewhere and I'm not really someone who goes to strip bars or or makes use of

662
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,820
professional services such as escorts but hey there's a business there right and what where is the

663
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:46,180
first escort podcast I have a feeling it can't be too far off I really do I was thinking to more

664
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,860
about uh let me see how much time do we have shoot oh man I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave that thought

665
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,260
for tomorrow that'll be good it'll be a that's a great think on it's Friday uh thought okay

666
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:04,980
back to well let's talk about the tsunami disaster for a moment there's some emails that came in

667
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,820
all stuff that is pertinent to the conversation that you'll find in the production show notes

668
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,140
certainly from hell's bellboy who sent me an email and listed actually a number of

669
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:23,700
horrible disasters typhoon and tsunami related disasters that have taken place in the region for instance

670
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:31,380
November 13th 1970 a massive typhoon hits Bangladesh 24th tidal wave struck the shores of the

671
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:39,540
gangest delta November 13th uh wreaking lethal damage 120 per a mile per hour cyclone more than

672
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:47,940
an estimated 100,000 dead 150,000 uh total of 150,000 dead the centuries largest disaster and he

673
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:56,100
goes on to list a couple more and I guess well hey it's just um interesting to you know to go back and

674
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,180
look at history and probably also you know this is what what most television broadcasts are gonna

675
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,820
start doing themselves and they're gonna go back and see if they can get footage from 1970 etc but

676
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,860
uh we have had these events you know these horrific events and it does seem they just they do seem

677
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:20,420
to kind of fade from from memory after a while don't they which is I presume human nature I guess that's

678
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:28,980
kind of normal I also asked um the uh actually there's uh I said you know so I said what what can we do

679
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:37,060
what is the best thing to do a lot of people pointed me to city.org cidi.org which is the center for

680
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,060
international disaster information they've actually got an MP3 out there which's gonna play for you

681
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,100
right now and which they tell you what they'd like you to do and how you can best help uh the victims

682
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,060
them countless victims of this horrible disaster. Humanitarian groups need your help in southern Asia

683
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,940
I'm John Butler thousands of people have been killed and many thousands more are injured or left

684
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,300
homeless in nine countries across southern Asia the tsunami touched off by the most powerful earthquake

685
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,980
in four decades ranks as one of the most devastating disasters in history. Americans wanting to help

686
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,180
maybe tempted to send food or blankets but caches the best way to help those affected by the tsunami

687
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,020
Suzanne Brooks director of the center for international disaster information cidi explains why

688
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,340
caches best. Cash offers relief agents is the most flexibility with cash disaster relief

689
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:30,420
professionals can work directly with those affected by disasters to get out exactly what is needed

690
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,940
such as medicine and food quickly. Before collecting anything individuals looking to donate should

691
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:44,100
contact an established relief organization for more log on to cidi.org or usad.gov or go to

692
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,620
interaction.org and click on the guide to appropriate giving. I can I tell you as uh oh let me just

693
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:56,340
reset one second as a helicopter pilot man I wish I could help you know I think I really could I

694
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,980
I'm I'm good at that stuff I'm good at hovering and and getting people out and I know how the

695
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,140
winch works and I can work with the winchmen but I'm sure they don't need my help in that

696
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:12,180
regard there so I send cash and it seems that everyone around the world is doing that much much more

697
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,820
than governments are actually pointing out it's really the citizens which is beautiful to see

698
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,100
and also asked uh in yesterday's podcast you know for all the god podcasters i said who's god did

699
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,020
this you know what is the point why you know could you please explain that to me which of course

700
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,260
is a question that's unfair to ask but you know it's shit it's my podcast and I did get some

701
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:37,380
responses to that and the many god i call them godcasters well let's say religious podcasters

702
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,220
have um have commented on this and have made note of it and uh I've linked to some of those

703
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:53,540
in the production show notes but also uh Rick um from i see him raw um he sent me a

704
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:59,540
comment well I'll play it for you right now because he did respond well listen up check this out

705
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,020
hey Adam Rick was with it's here for my see him raw you asked the godcasters to comment

706
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,500
on the horrible tragedy that occurred in the Indian Ocean this week and uh I'm not sure why

707
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:18,180
it occurred but I do want to share a couple of verses job 2 10 it says show me indeed except good

708
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:25,300
from god and not except adversity and uh job 42 2 says I know that you can do all things and he's

709
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,180
referring to god here and then no purpose of yours can be thwarted 68 thousand lives is uh he's

710
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,860
a lot of lives and I'm not sure why the Lord allowed it but it does say in job 1 21 that the Lord

711
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:44,180
is given and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord so I think what it really comes

712
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:50,020
down to is how are we who are left gonna respond I feel the same thing occurred after the

713
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:56,340
World Trade Center and uh to those who are uh who have died in Iraq how are we who are left

714
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:02,020
going to react how are we gonna show love to those who are in mourning and for those who

715
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,980
who are hurt and for those who are uh who are left how are we gonna respond and I think what it

716
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,740
really comes down to is we who are left needs to respond with love love maybe giving money love

717
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,940
maybe consoling a family member who is lost someone how are we gonna show love to those who are

718
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,020
left today and uh I think that's how how the Lord wants us to respond as well with your in the

719
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,260
podcast thanks great Rick Rick requires the way it's uh Weswitz from uh ICM raw podcast um okay I'm

720
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,260
not uh I'm not religious in that regard don't believe in god in the way uh Rick may or uh other people may

721
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:46,420
who and maybe you listening to this podcast but I do believe that um it is up to us from a

722
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,180
civility standpoint is Tony Khan would say from mourning stories from the podcast is um how do we

723
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,300
respond how are we going to love the people um that are hurt by this uh that is probably a challenge

724
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,860
and there is probably a reason for that most things do happen for a reason I found so there is a reason

725
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,780
for this and maybe it's just a focus all of us and uh to say hey you know uh you think Iraq is bad

726
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,020
maybe this is if if there was a god right and you went are you think this Iraq staff is bad

727
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,180
let me show I can do now pfff the fuckers and maybe we should wake up and say damn you know this

728
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,500
Iraq shit is stupid is it stupid you know and what is it for is it for hundreds of thousands of people

729
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,660
who've been affected by something or is it is it for a handful of people who are looking for

730
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,980
some spoils of something no that's not for me to decide um also a lot of people of um kind of

731
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,060
put out a call to actions saying hey why don't we do like a telephone you know try and raise money

732
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,540
yes I think clearly you know me telling you uh playing these bits from cidid.org

733
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,220
and and pointing on web logs etc to different places we can donate money this is clearly

734
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:59,060
something that podcasters can help out with I don't think we need to have some kind of like special

735
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,340
podcasse telephone to track it all because we know people are going to give money and we know that

736
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,780
they're going to give as much as they can and I quite honestly I just don't see you know any other reason to

737
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,860
track that through a podcasse and they say oh look at how much we raise with our incredibly powerful

738
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:18,660
medium I don't think that's necessary because I know how powerful it is we can raise 1500 bucks

739
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,300
amongst a couple of podcasse listeners you know for for Lee and Jenny's dogs I'm sure we're doing

740
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,980
pretty good with with the tsunami relief okay I'm gonna go a little bit long today but I got to

741
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,620
because yesterday I promise I was gonna play this song and I like it so much it is from

742
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:43,060
Barry Corals Confessions of an indie girl brand new find it Barry Coral dot com but it's an

749
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,900
Oh, I see you stop, but it ain't get fine

750
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,400
Sure, fair out the hallway that dreams

751

Don't always come true, I'm no, oh

So he just picked up his hopes

Overly in the show, hold his own car

754
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,900
But it won't wait to get back
