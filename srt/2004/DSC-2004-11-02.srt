1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Before we get started, let me remind you of the following results or events predicted on these things,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,000
namely, and materials from actual results.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,800
The fact is that good cause actual events results to differ from expectations include

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
lack of growth, intense competition in our industry,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,840
integration failures, changes in government regulations,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
operational failures, or looking to England's representatives.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
All right, so with fully as of today, it should not be

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,160
like common representatives in the death of any subsequent days.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,400
While we name the like something more than we say, it's a couple in the future.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,600
We need to not give it a leave in front of us, too.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,040
Augustine almost lies!

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,240
Adam Curry!

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,640
Our Lord of the Lord, give it to us.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
We have to do a good morning, good evening.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
Whenever it's applicable to your body, the world,

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,880
everybody inside of Curry this is the daily source code.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,080
We're Tuesday November 2nd, 2004, coming to you from Curry Castle,

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,360
Flamper's Belgium.

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
We're going to be for the next two and a half weeks.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
Lord, give it to the movies in an imminent imminent.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,440
It's coming up.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,440
This time, we got much to go into about.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
We are almost out of here.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,680
Wow, what a completely fucked up day we had here in the Netherlands.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,800
Damn, this morning everyone was kind of ready for the elections.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,720
Every single TV show here in the Netherlands had called me and asked me to be

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,400
a guest on their show, which I had at the time, because I just did not feel like

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
sitting on any TV show from midnight till 6th.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,480
I would much rather kind of watch it at home in the comfort of my own home, you know.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,720
And so the morning started with a whole bunch of phone calls coming in around nine

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,560
o'clock people saying that a very well-known columnist television host,

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,360
interviewer, producer, director, and also filmmaker, Dale Fahol,

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,640
which you would put out as algebraic set.

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,840
Theo Van Gogh, and yes, he is a descendant of any infamous and famous Vincent Van Gogh.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,080
Was murdered today in Amsterdam at about a quarter to nine.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:37,840
He was done down by a semi-automatic fire and then hacked with a knife, stabbed.

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,560
The details are a bit sketchy still, but some eyewitness reports say his throat was cut,

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
and a note was left on his body.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,880
And this happened right on the street, not far from his home.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,960
And I think from what I could see on the TV news, it looked like the note was actually pinned to

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,040
his body with this butcher knife. It was pretty shocking. Let me tell you about Theo Fahol.

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,160
So you get a little bit of perspective on this. This is one of these people that you have in society,

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,440
usually associated with media more than with politics, that really color everything.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,680
And make the world just a little bit more fun to live in because these people are always challenging

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,520
the edges of everything. And Theo Van Gogh's particular challenge was always his freedom of speech.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,240
And he exercised his right continuously. And he was not very well loved, although people who knew him

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,160
knew that he was a very, very, very sweet man, a very loving father.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,960
And in a way, he felt that this was his role and the number one issue that he'd been hammering on

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:09,840
for the past few years was how the multicultural integration process in the Netherlands has failed.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,560
Country of 16 million people, little over 16 million people in an air and land mass smaller than Rhode Island.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:34,000
And there's, I believe, 3 million Muslims of which a number are radical extremists.

52
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,200
And Theo was a guy who said, look, we've got a problem brewing here. The people know it.

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,680
The government is not responding. Something has to be done about this. This is something also,

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
by the way, that PIM4 times said, you'll remember the politician who was assassinated. And he wasn't assassinated

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:05,360
by or under the guise of some religious geod. But that was also one of his big mantras.

56
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,040
And this was not a racist issue. This is a pure issue of culture clash that is just not

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,000
driving within this country. I mean, I wasn't here when there's whole integration process started,

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,600
but they did not set it up right. I think if you have people who don't even speak the language

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,000
after having been here for seven or eight years, it's hard for them to integrate. Anyway,

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,520
I don't want to get down into the discussion of it all. But Theo also was very vocal.

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
And besides just being vocal in television programs and he wrote columns and newspapers,

62
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,760
he also made movies. And he recently did a movie with a Dutch minister, a senator minister.

63
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:03,040
She's a member of parliament, a Dutch parliament, here she is, and she is a Muslim woman

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,520
who is exercising her free speech rights to criticize her religion as long.

65
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,120
And they did a movie together, controversial movie, a short film,

66
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,600
which was basically about how women are treated

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:39,040
by or in the extremist believers of Islam. Very complicated. But there were some

68
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:50,640
very profound statements in that. And it just drove this particular guy who killed Theo,

69
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:00,240
it drove him to that point. And from by all accounts, this was totally a revenge murder for what

70
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,640
he had to say or his expressions in this movie. And as you can imagine in a country that speaks

71
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,440
a language that doesn't work anywhere else except for parts of Belgium and South Africa.

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,880
You know, we've got a very tight, closed community, which wants to be very open. And

73
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:26,880
you know, there's a lot of shit going on right now. So I didn't know Theo very well.

74
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,000
In fact, I met him, he invited me to be on the television show to be interviewed in a

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,720
simultaneous interview with Lowe de Valle, who's the, he's like the head of all the labor unions.

76
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
You know, they always try to get a contrast. So I guess I thought I would be the capitalist pig and he

77
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,160
would be the labor union guy. And we would, it turned out we had a lot more in common than we had

78
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,760
differences. But Theo was directing that show. And we chatted before and after the show.

79
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,560
And we decided to meet up. And we actually didn't meet only about four days later, I looked it

80
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,040
up on my weblog. And it was a great, you know, it came up to the place in Amsterdam, to the to the

81
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:17,680
bunker. And we chatted about everything from politics to, well, I was interested in getting him.

82
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,520
He has a website. Theo from Khach. But I wanted it really to be, you know, more like a weblog

83
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
structure. I was trying to help him get an RSS feed up and running, because he just, you know,

84
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,160
he needed more distribution. He had something to say. He was a blogger. And one thing we really

85
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,760
different on a opinion on was that he, he's a big bush supporter and thought that bush should

86
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
definitely be re-elected. And something that's interesting, because I'm looking to watching television

87
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
hearing all kinds of testimonials and he worked with a lot of actors. And they all said that he would

88
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,960
always say to them, you know, leave here, leave the Netherlands, go somewhere else. And it's funny

89
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,120
because when we had that meeting at the house, he said, what are you doing here? Leave, go, go back

90
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,560
to America. This place is going downhill. There's, you know, there's no saving it. Boy, you know,

91
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,240
how stuff can can roll. Anyway, I have a feeling you're probably going to hear about this.

92
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,160
It might, well, I'm sure, if it, yeah, it's probably going to get just totally buried because

93
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,320
of election coverage. Otherwise, it's something that would have made, and made the news in the

94
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,840
states. It made it around Europe because, you know, it's like show business. You know, it's a thing

95
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,240
this TV guy, filmmaker, getting killed and what I consider to be a pure jihadist action.

96
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,000
So, I was just kind of really weird. And, you know, everyone's calling each other and just,

97
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,240
you know, feeling really, really funny about what happened. However, we've got a show to do here,

98
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,240
ladies and gentlemen. So, let's play a little bit of music that is perhaps inappropriate for

99
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,040
today's events.

100
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
So, this is where it happened.

101
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
And, this is where he died.

102
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,880
This is where the sun's gone shining.

103
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

104
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

105
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

106
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

107
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

108
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

109
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

110
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

111
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

112
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

113
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

114
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

115
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

116
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

117
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

118
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

119
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

120
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

121
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

122
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

123
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
And, this is where the sun's gone shining.

124
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

125
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

126
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

127
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

128
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
So, this is where the sun's gone shining.

129
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Therefore, the sun's gone platinum.

130
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
So, this is where the sun shines.

131
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up

132
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:25,880
bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up, bring

133
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
This is where it sounds to me

134
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,300
I'll be a party

135
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,720
My joans from their album diyor

136
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,200
Strongация

137
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:23,600
And I've played mo jones before on on the show and now in the production notes as I'm using

138
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,720
my still undeveloped and spiffy new pod production console, you'll be able to find a link

139
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,960
to the Modions website which is Modions.nl and also some information about the album.

140
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,080
I read something on scripting news today about Dave was talking about some blogging tools

141
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:51,920
that support enclosures and help you put enclosures which basically is an RSS 2.0 feed

142
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which is what a podcast feed is all about and he suggested making a sub-directory on iPodor.org

143
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,400
in the iPodor directory which actually I think the site may be down or maybe I'm having some

144
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,120
DNS problems here. I'll have to check that later. I'm making a separate category which of course

145
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,600
is great because we want to help people make podcasts and make that as easy as possible. And

146
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,120
and you know thinking about that I can see that the aggregator developers so the guys who make

147
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,800
well as we're kind of popular aggregators are out there that are on the desktop certainly

148
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,520
we've got net news wire for the Mac. I hear a lot about news gator and some other

149
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,960
some other desktop-based aggregators. So they're getting into their waking up

150
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,280
and the starting to see that there's a part we go in on here on the iPodor's developer list

151
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,960
where users are and developers party together and that we're really achieving some awesome things

152
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,120
and they want to be a part of that and I think that makes a lot of sense actually but

153
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
all the notes I've gotten so far have been you know hey we we support enclosures and this is

154
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,080
what we do and I you know basically I think to myself oh yeah you know that's that's what we were

155
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,000
four or five years ago today it's about making the connection to well we're not really making the

156
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,480
connection to your iPodor MP3 player but we're making that connection to to mainly iTunes or the

157
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:41,120
Windows Media Center so there's a lot of intelligence a lot of knowledge on the iPodor developer list

158
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,680
I believe here listening to the developers podcast that Garth Kidd puts together

159
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,880
for the iPodor team iPodor lemons what I call it

160
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,800
that they're modularizing everything and you know so it's real easy I think to hop on board here

161
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,960
and you know we should put together some kind of checklist a day when I actually talked about this

162
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,200
when you check list of you know what an iPodor actually has to do and you know hurry on

163
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,880
up because especially you aggregator developers that support OPML there's some cool stuff happening

164
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,200
with directories and flows and and somehow we're going to be able to patch this pod production

165
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,080
console system into that and that's all going to be OPML I'm totally convinced I'm drinking the

166
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,560
cool aid everybody so you know you're welcome on board and you know and let's see if we can

167
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,280
that can help you out with with the final steps because it seems so trivial I know but it's really

168
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,040
it goes beyond just to get it in closure onto the desktop it has to get into iTunes or into

169
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,880
some other media player that will sync up with the mobile devices and I got a call today from

170
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:01,840
Jennifer Khan from wired magazine she's not she's a science writer actually writes about you know

171
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:10,160
nanotechnology and and really science geeky stuff and she's doing an article on

172
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,240
satellite radio which she she says she knows nothing about and I'm not quite sure because this

173
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,240
wasn't really an interview about pod casting although of course you know me I convinced her that

174
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,720
pod casting is the end all to be all but before we got to that you know she said you know

175
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,880
so what is this what is this satellite radio you know these guys actually have a chance of

176
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,360
making it will they be around and as we were talking you know and I was kind of making it up as I

177
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,080
went along and she was a really it turned out to be a really good discussion partner particularly

178
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,160
because she had no preconceived notions and and really you said she knew nothing about it so I was

179
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,040
able to kind of dig around in my brain and use my radio experience and we cope with a couple of

180
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,800
interesting angles and then as you know as relating it to pod casting all of a sudden and I don't

181
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,840
know if if I already had this conversation with someone if it was it it was probably with Dave I'm

182
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,520
not quite sure but it hit me you know because I was talking about how satellite radio basically they

183
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,760
have a limited spectrum as well it's just limited by money but you know so they can do 30 channels

184
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,240
or whatever and they're basically these channels are all specialized and this is what what Jennifer said she

185
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,280
said you know I don't like half the stuff that's on there this you know it's like the new wave

186
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,520
country crap I think is what she said and I said you know I actually I personally do like a couple

187
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,880
of the new wave country crap things and I realized that we're we're kind of both we're approaching

188
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,000
the same problem from different directions where here's the satellite radio guys who are

189
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,840
beaming down a very expensive signal with almost you know with very limited content or at least

190
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,480
the content is packers in such a way that you almost want to tevoize it you know so that you can

191
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,520
and in fact there are applications out there now that you record satellite radio and then you know

192
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,920
basically sort that and put it into a playlist and and play it on your MP3 player or play it back

193
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,200
through the through the digital system in your car I said well wait a minute wouldn't be really

194
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,200
interesting think about what what the satellite radio guys could do because they're basically

195
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,480
they're just using bandwidth right um they have seven megabits or whatever and they split that

196
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,880
up so they can get an X number of channels but it's coming down to the your receiver digitally

197
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,040
and these receivers are cheap you know that's that's the beauty of of what they're trying to do

198
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,840
is you know you can buy to the supermarket and you know you plug almost literally plug it into your

199
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,040
existing car stereo or you can buy the top of the line expensive you know model whatever you want

200
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,880
but they're just sending down digital data now what if instead of having the M&M channel which

201
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm sure is wonderful but you know I'm sure there's a channel that that they could give up what if

202
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:04,160
they decided to broadcast the top podcasts you know or the top 10 podcasts it could actually be

203
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,000
more I think about a 24 hour period so let's say a couple of shows or an hour you know you're

204
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,840
probably looking at 30 30 shows a day on one channel right before you start to repeat

205
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:25,600
and you basically sell a receiver that will hook up to your iPod and your iPod will recognize

206
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,520
these shows coming down the pipe or shit maybe just records them all you know whatever we'll get

207
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
rid of it if we don't need it because you know it's cheap but think about if there's no difference

208
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,920
between getting your podcast over the internet or receiving it through a satellite radio receiver

209
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,960
but you know it could just be a seamless process that's running in the background anyway that so

210
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,200
I I told Jennifer that you know we shouldn't do this interview we should go start a company together

211
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,160
and she thought that was funny and then I invited a blogger con I don't know she's gonna come

212
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,400
moving along uh one a highlight a couple of new podcasts today and this is actually the third

213
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,600
installment of this podcast but it's been on my list to let you hear a little bit of it

214
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,240
it's from a guy named Scott Lockman he lives in Tokyo and well that's pretty apparent when you

215
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
listen to the show.

216
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:33,200
oh this is Scott Lockman and welcome to Tokyo calling for Sunday October 31st you might

217
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,480
call this the take to episode yes indeed I've been working for the last two hours trying to put

218
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,720
together an episode I had 15 minutes of good stuff recorded using the program audacity

219
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,000
and the thing crashed and I had not saved it beforehand so might talk this one up for podcasting

220
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,200
learning episode number one what a bummer it was some pretty good stuff and it is gone there

221
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,000
oh dude you're gonna live through so much more of that and last you listen to me and get yourself

222
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
an external recording device just for about a hundred you live in Tokyo they're probably about

223
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,800
50 bucks over there just a little flash based MP3 player and you know 256 megabytes is more than enough

224
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,160
you can connect it up via USB then every piece of sound you can produce with your computer

225
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,720
goes straight to the output if you can hear it you're recording it then you've got a total solution

226
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,520
it's a temp file somewhere and I looked at it and it's about 60 different

227
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,280
AU files all of them about one megabyte in there and it would take me more than another hour

228
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,560
why does our density do that together so it will just have to be an episode that lives in my

229
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,280
memory and one that is gone anyhow I still feel the need to get this out I want to do something

230
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,880
before I go to bed not make this time spent a total wash I've appreciated all of the

231
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,560
comments that have come in through the email this has been a great pleasure for me to put

232
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,080
Tokyo calling together okay so there you go Tokyo calling you can of course catch that through

233
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,720
the ipodder.org directory and I am putting in the links to it's actually it's a good idea

234
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,280
and it's at this time I console you need to have the subscribe here link uh wait until I automate

235
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,000
this thing it's going to be awesome it's going to be so easy to retrieve the source code if you

236
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,440
will to the daily source code yep sucking on on exhaust again oh and a member was telling

237
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,520
about the Gilmore gang yesterday how it totally ruined my weekend there was no Gilmore gang alone

238
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,720
okay Steve you win this is Doug K the host and producer of IT conversations and not just for the

239
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,400
sake of Steve Gilmore who has been bugging me to get an audio announcement out there explaining that

240
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,360
we didn't have a chance to do a Gilmore gang this past week but for all of the listeners who have

241
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,640
written and who have lost a lot of sleep wondering where the Gilmore gang was from Friday October 29th

242
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,280
the fact is that we had a cancellation we couldn't put the show together Steve did everything in his

243
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,320
power to get one together on Saturday a pre-election edition of the Gilmore gang but it just wasn't

244
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,120
meant to be so we'll do everything we can to get you on this coming Friday November 5th it will of

245
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,280
course be our first post-election edition of the Gilmore gang I'm Doug K the host and producer of IT

246
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,400
conversations and thanks for listening see that that's cool and actually I almost considered doing one

247
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,200
of those myself because it was so late this is actually right now it's oh shit it's three minutes

248
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,240
at two a.m. two minutes at two clock just switched I'm going to stay up a little bit and watch

249
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,320
some of the election coverage but I was considering doing the little hey guys I'm going to

250
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,240
watch the elections I'll catch in a moral podcast but then I said no no I've got to be there for the

251
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,000
gang and for people like Scott Brenner hey Adam Scott I was from Boulder Colorado I was calling to

252
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,040
turn you on to coverville.com this guy Brian's doing a podcast 20 minute half hour podcast

253
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,680
only doing cover songs pretty interesting was really interesting if you hadn't got an

254
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,920
ask cap license told him exactly what he's doing and they gave it to him I thought you might

255
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:11,040
cover that on your show and maybe you'd be interested in helping promote him so that ask cap feels

256
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,960
like oh this was smart for us to give him the license we're getting you know we're getting paid

257
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,600
and might help establish the license as you know reasonable that they're not going to six

258
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,600
months go hey that's that's not what we had in mind want to pull that license just thought

259
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,320
it's the Halloween edition of coverville and I promise you not once will I play the monster

260
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
mash coming up right now

261
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:14,240
happy Halloween and welcome to October 31st edition of coverville I'm Brian Abbott thank you for

262
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:22,000
listening we're going to get into some Halloween music later on but no now we'll be songs I promise

263
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:32,080
but first I want to get into a quick dedication John Peel BBC DJ extraordinaire again he was a

264
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,360
DJ for the BBC longer than I've been alive and longer than fans of the music that he

265
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,080
helped promote was alive hopefully that made sense he passed away earlier this week

266
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,680
very sad and and definitely very sad occasion for London because he was just huge out there

267
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,280
responsible for the discovery and popularity of bands like the Smiths and pulp and the

268
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,240
cure a lot of great great music video promote I'm in a play something that according to the

269
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,360
BBC's website they did a really nice piece on him on his biography apparently his favorite track

270
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:24,160
was a a single called teenage kicks by the undertones in 1978 he played it constantly

271
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:32,720
until finally Sire Records landed a deal with the undertones and and they got the music

272
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,680
a little more widespread I'm not going to play the original by the undertones I'm going to go ahead and play

273
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:47,360
a cover version by busted which came out just recently so there you go a little bit of cover

274
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,520
ville thank you very much Scott Brenner for turn me on to that and I was happy to hear the whole

275
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
piece about John Peel who we spoke about before on the daily source code and now you can hear some

276
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,200
of the bands you discover but also hear what you know what was being said about how he just played

277
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,840
these songs over and over and over again and that's exactly what we can do with podcast you know

278
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,280
this is this is how it works you know if records don't become hits without some kind of

279
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,840
infrastructure oh there you go that's another one for the list when you need a top 40 right podcast

280
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,240
pod tune top 40 something like that email from Dithermaster boy that I that I

281
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:32,560
fucked up on this remember yeah yeah yes I played those I trip tones to see if I could change

282
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,840
everyone's iPod to a different frequency so I got some feedback on that Adam if you want the

283
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,840
I trip tones files to actually change frequencies you have to not play the bit after the pause that's

284
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,280
the cancel code that makes the I trip not change frequencies it's there sort of your iPod plays the

285
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,880
frequency songs by accident say during the all play shuffle mode then your I trip won't change

286
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:07,520
frequency so I guess it didn't work as you would say in the programming biz so yes I shouldn't have

287
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,600
played the second blitz okay so that makes sense because I always wondered about that if if you're

288
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,120
iPod accidentally picks one of those tunes at random which has those tones in it you know will

289
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,280
it then start switching frequencies that's how they solve that with just little hack by putting in

290
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:30,480
the clear tone for not to change but he says please please don't send that in your podcast it

291
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,680
would suck for anyone using an I trip no longer packing the I trip files to change back or worse

292
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,160
fumbling with their iPod on traffic and crashing I used to use an I trip I would curse your

293
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,760
name if you did that you know what now they think about it yeah that was pretty stupid I'm sorry but

294
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,880
you know in case we need it we can always use it as some kind of you know emergency broadcast system

295
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,200
and it's good to know that it's there the latest search engine from Google could turn out to be a

296
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,080
privacy nightmare once installed in a computer running Windows 2000 or Windows XP the new Google tool

297
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,520
can find whatever's done on that machine including email sent or receive via outlook or outlook

298
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,920
express AOL instant messaging and web visits it won't just give you an idea it will actually show

299
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,440
you the physical pages and things that you've done. Pam Dixon is head of the world privacy forum

300
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,880
she's concerned that the beta version of a Google desktop search now available for free downloading

301
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,520
is not password protected so if you install it anyone with physical access to your PC has easy

302
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,280
access to whatever you've done machine so for example let's say you go shopping online it will

303
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:47,920
collect your credit card numbers if you do banking online collect your passwords and you're on my

304
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,280
thinking financial information and consider this use a computer that has Google desktop search

305
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,000
installed say you want to check your email from a friend's house they can see everything you did

306
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,760
on that computer in complete detail by the way Google is the first but other companies have similar

307
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,640
search engines in the works and that's today's tip i'm her voice bomb the consumer man

308
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,480
looking out for you on coma 1000 news i love her he's always looking out for us you should

309
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,360
subscribe to that if you're not already a coma 1000 news podcast you can find in the ipod.org

310
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,200
directory and a reminder that if you want to look for new podcast that have just been updated or just

311
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,720
fresh audio dot weblogs dot com is where you can check those out if you want to get on that list

312
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,000
there's an information ipod.org as well about how to use the ping form or use a blogging tool

313
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,880
that'll do that for you automatically so that when you publish your podcast everyone knows about it

314
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,560
and of course there's also a back end to that which can be used by developers as well you know

315
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:54,720
imagine i'm using ipod.rex currently i'm waiting for the new ipod 11 version their next release

316
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,640
i can't wait to try out all different pieces of software but you know already we're integrating the

317
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,560
directory so what if there's a new show you know it could you could have stuff high light or tune you know

318
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:12,640
just all kinds of cool things we can do and you can you know set up rules and oh boy love it

329
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,280
and i'm trying to prioritize but it's a mess it is just a mess there's so much email coming in

330
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,440
and i've learned from the past that the less email you send the less you receive but even that's

331
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,600
not really helping right now uh so in preparing for my flight i'm also uh stocking up on on podcast

332
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,400
it's really hard i'm forcing myself not to listen um there's uh uh let's see uh IT conversations

333
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:45,600
behind the mic uh uh interview with it with my uh my partner and crime Dave Winner um and i've

334
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,840
listened to a little bit of it but you know i want to save it i want to save that for the for the plane

335
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,640
there's also uh Doug K was on a web talk radio uh we're also podcasting now and i want to listen to

336
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,440
that uh what i do catch uh and i'm so happy Dave uh um at this i think this is for the first time

337
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,120
and i talked to him about it he is now uh morning coffee notes is now officially a podcast and it was

338
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,200
in you know about time we still we still need to get an opening tune for him but now he's he's put

339
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,040
some structure into the show and what the couple things i really like about uh about uh the morning

340
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,440
coffee notes uh one is the into just that even the title suggests such an intimacy you know you know

341
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,400
here we are and of course i come from the written port the written version of morning coffee notes uh

342
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,760
which is kind of you know Dave's brain dump uh uh you know that that he has with his morning coffee

343
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,480
but they don't necessarily have to be done in the morning they can be done at any time but there's a

344
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,400
real intimacy and uh i got to find out what microphone is using because it sounds really clean you know

345
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,680
it's just a very clean uh audio in fact if i'm listening on the on the iPod sometimes i can

346
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,520
hear i think it's a refrigerator or something that's kind of humming in the background and when that

347
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:05,840
kicks off then you really realize how quiet it is um and uh so i wanted to play a little piece

348
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,280
about uh the food this whole this whole podcast is great because there's stuff in there about

349
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,920
how to make money on the internet with web logs with podcasts and um and and Dave goes into some

350
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,320
some good detail about that i really suggest you listen to it if you're interested in making money

351
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,440
you may not be um but as it relates to blogger con um he did a little piece about the Saturday

352
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,800
food for thought dinners uh and i'm hosting one table i think there's a whole bunch of tables um

353
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,440
and it's actually two i think two podcasting tables and dawn and drew will be hosting a second

354
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:47,600
table so what a hood um but the thought behind the the food for thought dinners is uh there's a

355
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,000
couple of different thoughts behind it but the one that i that i really like the most is comes from

356
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,160
some personal experience that Dave has with uh with conferences which i find to be exactly like mine

357
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,280
care to talk about what you you know what you signed up for but also it's okay to wander a little bit

358
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,960
it's a it's a it's a social event and that leads to the second reason why uh we do these dinners

359
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,280
is so that there can be a Saturday evening social event for basically that's open to everybody

360
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,680
and this is one of the nicest i went to uh the world economic form conference in uh

361
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:30,000
in Dallas uh Switzerland uh in 2000 and um this was one of the nicest things that they did there

362
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,040
now had i relied on you know making dinner plans with uh people that i knew uh at the conference

363
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,720
i would have eaten dinner alone every night um as i had in the early years of my career in the

364
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,720
computer industry where you know i wasn't necessarily you know i for many years i wasn't an 18

365
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,160
you know and people didn't necessarily want to eat dinner with me they were always kissing up and

366
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,000
trying to eat dinner with you know more famous or richer people and uh more influential people

367
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,560
and so very often i would be at these conferences um um you know first or second nights and have

368
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,280
absolutely nothing to do you know which was really ridiculous because um you know those are the

369
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,000
people that pay for the conference by the way the people who don't have anything to do on the

370
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,480
and of course buttercon is a is a free conference you don't have to pay to come to it but the

371
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,440
principles still stands in fact you know we we for more or less codified this we tried to

372
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,480
discourage people from having private events at the conference uh they do happen people will get

373
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,360
invited to uh you know sort of like invite only sorts of things uh and they don't invite me to

374
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,520
them anymore because i tell them forget it don't do it i won't go you know because i feel that

375
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:56,320
i'm trying to in in doing this conference to create um something that's kind of like the

376
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,920
blogged sphere where um anybody can set up a blog you don't need to be um sort of an industry

377
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,680
insider or an influential person or anything like it and as a result many of the really if you did

378
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,280
didn't many of the good blogs wouldn't exist um mine sure wouldn't exist i mean i'm not the kind

379
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,760
of guy the industry you know likes to turn to for um insider advice they they more or less like to

380
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,600
forget about me and um no which is why i played it don't come easy it's getting over it all right so

381
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,520
that's a bit from morning coffee notes and you'll be hearing a lot more uh on multiple podcast about

382
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,880
blogger con i'm sure of it i let a new podcast now it's the gator jug podcast

383
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,360
good morning this is Mike Levin this is your podcast from the swamp and uh we are here in beautiful

384
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,480
winter park florida on monday november first it's about six forty five a.m. the sun is just coming up

385
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:20,000
we don't have much debris left from the uh the um hurricanes that have hit but there's still a bit

386
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,520
in the streets it's the day before election day and uh i'm just back from beautiful Switzerland

387
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:36,320
my wife ran the double in marathon last week this is from the the poor brethren of the podcast

388
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:44,240
you've ever just gone monday that was a a lifelong dream of hers and i decided to meet her in Zurich

389
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,840
on Wednesday and then we had lunch in Milan for the weekend uh from florida to Switzerland and uh

390
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,000
enjoy a change of pace and uh climate and et cetera for a couple of days okay that's right

391
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,400
of the gator jug podcast there just want to let you know that there's all kinds of different voices

392
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,800
out there do a different things and of course now that i've got the production notes together you'll

393
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:14,080
be able to find the podcast feed directly uh from the post and uh this was it uh the some other

394
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,400
stuff we're working on uh uh uh that's too early to talk about that i don't know how to explain it yet

395
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,520
hit when that happens uh another promo uh people using openpodcast.org to uh to promote

396
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,480
their stuff which i think is a great idea i really like this open podcast idea of you know just a

397
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,800
place where you can either phone in uh or you can email a file i think it also email a url and point

398
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,680
to a file um very cool concept because it's kind of like the PR engine of podcasting uh and

399
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,240
i think there's room for many different ones you know there should be a podcast feed

400
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,840
that's for certain types of announcements you know it should it should be short things which

401
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,840
these openpodcast.org pieces are really interesting uh particularly uh when it came across uh

402
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:25,520
this promotional announcement hello world introducing some instale.net a place where you can find

403
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,160
music from Germany where your club can find informations about bands from Germany and we can find

404
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:42,640
some stuff from the internet check it out some estale.net it's spelled as a mm-e-l-s-t-e-l-l-e

405
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:25,360
uh fine German podcast with German music and i gotta tell you that the German

406
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,720
rock scene was always tripping out a little bit you know the just a whole the whole culture and the

407
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,640
whole vibe is a little bit different from uh from the states or maybe even any other year

408
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,080
you can definitely know cool little jingle there at the end actually i should look this up

409
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:46,640
uh because um i hung out with the scorpions uh remember they were really big uh uh what was uh

410
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,000
was the wind the river or what was it uh i can't remember the name of the song um but they did

411
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,120
something called the mascom music piece festival i should talk about a couple stories because i

412
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:07,520
went along with that that was an 88 i think um actually i i i'd put up a site one time uh which is

413
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,560
at mtv.curry.com where i had started uh this is when uh David first introduced me to directories and

414
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,760
i started putting a directory together um and i started you know just an alphabetical directory

415
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,040
there's some missing spaces but i was writing all the stories codifying what happened in the

416
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:33,040
at the mtv days and that you hear it is i'm i'm gonna read the story to you oh this is funny okay

417
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:44,080
holy shit um okay many a story this was posted um uh on oh wow how about this this was posted

418
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:54,000
on november second 2001 at 1259 p.m. damn so that was you know a year ago exactly whoa okay

419
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,400
i don't know this that there's a reason for that obviously let me read this to you many a story

420
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,040
must be told about the mascom music piece festival among the many attendees like aziyahs born

421
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:11,120
and bunjilvi were German rock gods scorpions shenker swans it my tale of aziyahs born you can read

422
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,240
parts of the incredible journey we made from Newark to Moscow you made a quick stop in Frankfurt to

423
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,000
pick up claustmina and the rest of the scorpions the scorpions were semi retired by then the drummer

424
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,240
was even living on a mountain top and monkey carlow so these guys were pretty used to the star

425
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,360
treatment star treatment was a far cry from the accommodations we were given in Moscow yes it was

426
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,520
the best hotel on town but they still had to turn on the hot water facility and that part of town

427
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,960
especially for us the beds were mattresses filled with straw though each room did have a tiny

428
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,360
black and white set with one channel running that I suppose with some government propaganda

429
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,480
this is before the wall came down so we were in the heart of communist russia in another story

430
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,280
i'll delve into how skid rose Sebastian Bach and i wound up hanging out with the masco chapter

431
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,800
the hell's angels a telephone was not a service considered standard in russian those days

432
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,360
there was one phone per floor on the hotel and operator physically sat by the phone and if a

433
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,920
call came in she would knock on your door to inform you that there was a call you take the call out

434
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,760
in the hallway at her at her little station subsequently making a phone call was even worse

435
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,480
you give the number to the phone lady who would schedule the call to be made the lag time between

436
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,000
scheduling the call and getting place was about six hours i guess the kgb wanted to ensure their

437
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,960
taps were in place later i hooked up with some cool guys from the westward one radio satellite

438
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,160
truck who would link their stuff so they had an actual 516 area code dial tone in the truck for

439
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,760
which let me use whenever i wanted to call home for those without such geek contact she

440
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,520
really had to stay in the neighborhood of the phone lady since she called might be put through

441
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,080
after only four hours of waiting time last thing you want was to miss her knock and have to

442
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,640
reschedule the call so i mean the hallway on the way to pick up a can of tuna fish from my room

443
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,960
one of the items on the list for everyone to bring when i noticed the phone lady is trying to

444
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,000
figure out where root off shanker is because it's called been placed and was waiting for him

445
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,520
now since the scourps axman wasn't in his room i figured i'd be a good dooby and try to find him

446
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,040
so i knocked on his brother's door which wasn't closed properly it's one open upon my knuckle

447
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,320
wrap to reveal root off sitting in a chair receiving a blow job from some germ if from some

448
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:29,120
Russian girl whoops phone call for you i closed the door and decided i didn't want the tuna fish

449
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,760
