00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
How are you, everybody? Good afternoon. Welcome to the Daily Source Code for Dan. Thursday, October

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,480
14th, 2004. This is the low bandwidth edition of the show because I've been cut off by

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,000
my provider. I'm back to 56K so I'll probably upload it at a gas station somewhere.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Either that or I've waited until past midnight when my bandwidth quota drops down below

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,120
it's 30 to eight, 30 gig levels. So the show is no problem. Creating the show is pretty

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,280
easy today but actually getting it up on the server and getting everything published is a

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,680
little bit more challenging. Regardless today, thank god I was able to get some stuff

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,520
with iPod overnight before the bandwidth cut off and I'll talk about that a little bit later on.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,800
We got a viewer's final listener response from Australia. We've got some news about

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,680
St. Helens. We've got listener response from Japan and a history of the commercial internet.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,320
And because I've been so low on on pipe in the past, it was the past 10 hours. It's now three

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,160
in the afternoon. This is coming to you from Curry Castle in Flanders. I had a lot more chance

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,560
to catch up on email and check out some core respondents and I really have to say,

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:32,440
it's been so nice. All of the work that we've done together, developers and people who are just

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,280
podcasting. So here's a song for you guys for everyone who's been helping out with this really fun

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:48,760
movement. Thank you for being a friend. Travel down a road and back again. Your heart is true.

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:02:03,160
You're a pal and a confidence. I'm not ashamed to sing. I hope it always was day to sway.

18
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,160
My head is all focused and up and take a bow.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:24,680
And get you through a party invited everyone you knew. We you won't see the biggest difference

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:35,000
for me and the card attached would say thank you for being a friend. Thank you for being a friend.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,480
Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for being a friend.

22
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:04,360
If it's a car you lack, I truly buy you a car lack. Whatever you need in a time of the day

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:20,920
and night. I'm not ashamed to sing. I hope it always was day to sway. My head is all focused and up and

24
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:37,400
take a bow. And when we both get older, with walking keys and hair away, I'm your fear even though

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,560
it's hard to hear. I will stay in your clothes and say thank you for being a friend.

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:56,680
Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for being a friend.

27
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:38,360
And when we go and come away into the night, when we'll be late, you'll be gone

28
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:53,640
as we get to sway. Thank you for being a friend.

29
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:24,440
Thank you for being a friend. Thank you for being a friend.

30
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:44,520
Thank you for being a friend.

31
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Thank you. Thank you for being a friend.

32
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Andrew Gold, for all the iPod or developers and all the podcasters parting with us today on

33
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,680
the source code. Thank you for being a friend. Isn't that just a sweet song?

34
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,280
So this is the source code for Thursday, October 14, 2004. You probably saw the posting on my

35
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,960
weblog if not. Here's what happened or what has happened in the past and I thought I was over this

36
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,040
with my internet provider here in Belgium. The good news about living in a castle is that you live

37
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,480
far away from everybody and you've got just nature surrounding you. And of course that's also

38
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,400
the bad news because that means that ADSL is not possible. We're too far from the head office.

39
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:58,840
Now we do have cable mode from tailonet.be and oops. It's me wifey poo. Hold on a sec, I got to take

40
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:16,840
this. Hello. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. My happy-happy passport, though. No need, I'm going to

41
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:26,760
walk the new. Okay. Jamie Nayser. Okay. Exhibit in the show. This is like a shelterous bella.

42
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:39,960
Okay. Rusta Khan. Love you. Bye. Right. So that was my wife. She's in Brussels right now.

43
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,720
That's about an hour's drive from from our house from the castle.

44
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,520
Because Christina's passport actually expires in what like five days or something like that.

45
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,040
So seeing as we're moving to the UK, she had to go get the passport taken care of.

46
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,480
I have jobs too. Obviously, I'll get her on to the bandwidth in a second. Let's see.

47
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,520
The getting the new bed that job was taken away from me. I'm looking at the note on the wall here.

48
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm supposed to look for schools. Found a lot of schools. Here's a problem. If you want to put

49
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,920
your kid into a public school in the UK, you can't apply until you actually are living in the UK.

50
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,040
So I'm making good friends with Audrey, who happens at the same birth date as Christina.

51
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,400
And we'll probably be able to smuggle maybe a week or two. But it's also very, very full.

52
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,560
All the schools are full. And so it's going to be interesting to get Christina in midterm.

53
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,320
But I'm sure we'll work that out. Another thing I was supposed to take care of was the piano.

54
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,840
We have a discleaveer. DSC was it three or something like that from Yamaha. It's a baby grand piano.

55
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,800
A midsize baby grand piano. It's white, which there's only like three of them in the entire world.

56
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,160
It's one of these pianos that plays itself. You can also record your playing and it'll play it back.

57
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,640
And it doesn't play it back as a recording. It plays it back. Really playing it on the keys.

58
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,080
And we decided that now that we're moving, time to get rid of some stuff.

59
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,720
And this is one of those pieces of stuff that we haven't used. No one plays anymore.

60
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,080
Christina and I took lessons for two years and then we said, hey, screw it. She wanted to ride horses.

61
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,880
And I wanted to fly out like copters. So I'm trying to get rid of that.

62
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,920
I found a place that will put it up for consignment in their showroom. But it's, oh man, I'm moved like this.

63
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,640
An international move is not easy. So anyway, back to the bandwidth. I've had this with this provider before.

64
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:39,560
So I've cable. And what happens is they have a limit. They have a total bandwidth limit and an upstream limit.

65
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,720
Now I've surpassed the upstream limit before because, of course, in their asynchronous money-making scam,

66
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,440
they let you upload only a third of what you can download. So that's part of the big scam. The man has over us.

67
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,760
And I said, look, I've said this many times. Just let me buy whatever ban with, you'll sell me.

68
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,880
Just give it to me. And so finally they found that I have like now the top level account,

69
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,600
which is the super duper gamers account. I have 30 gigs. You can't get more. There's no business account.

70
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,840
They can get you more. You can only get more IP addresses or email addresses or something like that or more web space.

71
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,200
Whatever. Let me see how my battery is doing here all on. Now we look to be doing okay.

72
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,920
So with all this podcasting, and it's not the upstream bandwidth because I didn't even come near

73
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,040
to half of that, it's the download bandwidth. You know, I've subscribed to everything I'm putting into the

74
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,080
directories to check it out, listen to it, listen to bits. And of course I have to listen to every single

75
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,000
dawn and drew show now that I know that dawn doesn't love with me. Right, Dawn?

76
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,280
So I exceeded my maximum. That what happens is automatically they cut down your modem speed

77
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,920
to from a cable modem literally to like 56k. And they do it in a really nasty way by destroying

78
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,960
about 40% of your packets, which makes all kinds of applications not work reliably. And just really

79
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,000
crappy. And the thing is, they will not sell me more bandwidth. I'm sitting here saying tell me

80
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,400
what it costs, give me another 30 gigs, give me another three terabytes, whatever. Now I'm sorry.

81
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,880
We just, we don't have the application to sell you more. And this is like, it's like the electric company

82
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,360
saying, oh, we're sorry, Mr. Curry. You have used too much electricity this month already. We're

83
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,000
cutting you down. In fact, you can only leave half your lights on from now on until the end of the month.

84
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,200
You know, so it sucks. It's just really fucking blows. So what I will probably wind up doing

85
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,760
is driving, well, people have been very helpful. They've given me all kinds of hotspot lists.

86
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,160
Now, I installed a couple of Wi-Fi base stations and four computers in the local grade school.

87
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,200
When Christina will still go into that school and I donated all this MAC stuff, all the new

88
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,040
e-max. So I'm going to drive by there because I did leave it open on purpose. I'm going to drive

89
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,920
by there, see if that's still open. Otherwise, I left to go to a gas station on the highway,

90
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,480
which has an official hotspot operated by Bellhacom. And I'll probably upload from there.

91
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,480
So I'm probably going to encode a little lower bit rate than normal, just to lower the

92
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,240
file size a bit more because even, you know, if I'm on a good line, it can still take quite a while

93
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,840
to upload the show. And I also want to be downloading. So I'm going to be sitting the parking

94
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,200
lot for about an hour and a half watching, you know, half go up and watching stuff come in.

95
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,720
It should be very entertaining. And if that doesn't work out, then somewhere around,

96
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,640
well, somewhere after one AM, I'll be able to get my bandwidth back. And then, of course, it'll

97
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,560
still be limited. So it sucks. It just sucks. Oh, look at my, looking at my list here. I also have

98
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:51,080
to figure out the stables. Stabiling for the horse. Oh, man, my life. Okay. Let's see. One of the

99
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,520
things that's been circling around on the net for the past few days is this theory that

100
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:03,400
George W. Bush during the debates had an earpiece in and was being tutored or coached throughout

101
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,960
the debate. Now, I've talked about this before. I think we've even talked about it on trade

102
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,120
secrets, not necessarily related to the debates, but just in general. So it's so often seems

103
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,920
like George W. He's sitting there and these long pauses, like he's listening to someone, you know,

104
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,560
prompting him and giving him the, you know, the next line that he should say. And it's sometimes

105
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,280
he just comes across that way. So now, of course, and I'm going to play the piece that Dave

106
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,320
Winer pointed to first, because I got, you know, it's so easy to do this. That's why I'm sure

107
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,560
that there's more than just the two that are going to play for you. But here's some actual audio

108
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,520
from the prompting of George Bush. Not doing the debate. I have that for you in a second. I have

109
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,000
a secret audio recorded from the, from his prompting service in his earpiece. First, this

110
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:05,240
is just from a general speech. Mr. Chairman, delegates, foul citizens, farmers, fellow citizens,

111
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:16,680
Americans have been given hills to climb and found the strength to climb them to climb them.

112
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,720
When I, when I said those words 26 years ago, four years ago, four years ago,

113
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,080
now we can see the valley below. My father surveyed years at the side of another great American,

114
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,720
Laura Bush. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Pinching plans, worker training. We're created for the

115
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,640
world of yesterday. Tomorrow. Not tomorrow. Not tomorrow. Yesterday. Yesterday. Oh, I give up.

116
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,640
I could listen to that over and over again. I think this one's even better. And I haven't heard

117
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,040
it seen this one around on the night yet. So I think you'll appreciate it. Here's actual recorded footage

118
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,960
recorded tape of the president's earpiece during the second presidential debate.

119
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,440
He said he was $487 billion and voted against it right before he voted for it. voted for confusing.

120
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,720
But it works. That's since they confusing single people. He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a great

121
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,760
threat. Now said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Now, I can't see why

122
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,440
that. Because he got that. He changed his position quite often because he does. Now you don't find George.

123
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,400
You know, for a while, he was a strong supporter of getting the Saddam Hussein. No, it's not a god.

124
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,640
There is a system until the Democrat primary came along.

125
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,800
How are they? They don't like him any. And how are they in the anti-war can it began to gain on him?

126
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,160
He changed positions. I don't say you can leave this country in a time of war, in a time of

127
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,240
uncertainty. You change your mind because of politics. He just brought up the tax. There you go.

128
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,280
You remember that? We preached that child credit by $1,000.

129
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,160
We reduced the marriage penalty. You spent a little bit of a 10% tax bracket for the low-income

130
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,760
Americans. That's right at the middle class. There you go. He voted against it. And he tells you

131
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,280
he's for middle class tax customers. You've got to be consistent. There's a lot of pressures.

132
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,600
You've got to be firm. This president, I would follow up.

133
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,480
We have a series of questions on Iraq. And so I would turn to the next questioner.

134
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,920
It's a question to President Bush. And the questioner is Robin?

135
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,280
Just not. We practiced it.

136
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,800
Can you get him like a water or something?

137
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,360
Just drink water or something. George, it's just water.

138
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,600
Just a president. Yes, he is. Don't. We'll get more. He's not asking the question. Look at the

139
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,520
audience. Master structure. Just like we practiced it. But just apply to the

140
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,120
education by stating, I think you have a real hard question in the knowledge. We'll

141
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,600
carry out our needs. That is down to reduce weapons of mass destruction.

142
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,560
Booting could have passed this knowledge to our Dutch enemies.

143
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,360
Okay. That blank is just not believe. This to be a reasonable justification for being

144
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,600
yourself. I'll charge you to. For invasion. When this statement applies to so many of the

145
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,800
centuries, including North Korea. Each situation is different. Each situation is different,

146
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,000
Robin. And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use

147
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,760
a position. Hardest decision for those who make his paper to use force.

148
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,640
I don't know about it. 9-11. 9-11. There you go.

149
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,400
Well, differently. 9-11. We had to recognize, we saw threat.

150
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm going to let you go here and get my notes. We must take a series of

151
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,240
graphic. I don't know if it's 5 days. We'll see a threat.

152
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,800
Oh, man. 9-11 bullshit. No, yeah. Just think about your favorite salad dressing.

153
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,640
Please vote for John Kerry. Believe me. It's the best thing to do.

154
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,000
We've been along with a source code for today. As we're about 18 minutes into the show,

155
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was listening to a fine IT Conversations podcast, memory lane with Halle suit. By the way,

156
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,040
got a mail from Doug K, who told me that there is a way to get just the feeds that you want.

157
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:35,400
You don't have to subscribe to the main feed. I just didn't look closely enough at the website.

158
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,360
And quite honestly, I like subscribing to everything that comes from IT Conversations.

159
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,680
Oh, there was one thing. During this particular interview, Doug, I could hear your hybrid,

160
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,960
your phone hybrid bleeding over and you were talking to someone else and you could just

161
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,440
barely hear it in the background, but I had it really loud on the iPod. In this particular

162
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,680
memory lane with Halle suit, what Halle does she talks to, you know, pioneers of our industry,

163
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,920
of technology, of networking, of computers. And she interviewed Len Kleinrock, in that inventor of

164
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:14,360
packet switching. So arguably, one of the guys who founded the internet. And I've mentioned before

165
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,960
in both trade secrets. And I think also on the source code that I was, you know, without a doubt,

166
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,400
partially responsible for the commercial internet. And there was so much pushback at the time

167
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,840
when the commercial internet started, people hated us for doing that. And I was interested to hear

168
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,320
what Len Kleinrock's take would be on that. And I was probably even more surprised by what

169
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,760
his actual take was. He's going to explain it a little bit. He's going to kind of set it up

170
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,120
as we drop into the story after the Arpenads already been founded. And NSF comes into the picture.

171
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:57,560
National Science Foundation was now governing who could use the network. They had an acceptable

172
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,000
use policy. And it was a very liberal policy. They allowed all of their constituents in

173
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,840
the biologist, the physicist, the chemist, the meteorologist, the geologist, the oceanographers,

174
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,480
all manner of science when else don't see the network. So it's great to expand it the user's

175
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,920
base. Now, again, it was researcher oriented. But many of these research organizations

176
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,720
lived inside large corporations. For example, the research group that IBM, the research group

177
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,680
at major chemical companies, all exploration companies. And what were these guys doing with the

178
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,480
net besides moving down to the data back and forth? You said it before, Hally, they would do an email.

179
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,240
An email was a terrific application. What you have to realize that those researchers inside this

180
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,560
large corporation couldn't keep the secret of email from the others in the organization. So the

181
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,560
production people saw it, development people, the sales folks, top management, pretty soon,

182
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,160
the internet usability and applications leaked out from the research organization

183
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,680
into the entire commercial organization. And that's when the dot com's began to appear.

184
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:19,400
Right. And I know that was the big issue at that time, is the net should the net be commercialized.

185
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,960
And the academic community had a lot of different ideas about it. Right. Can you tell me about that?

186
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,160
Well, as I said in the very early days, we were small community of people who trusted each other.

187
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:39,240
We didn't put in restrictions as to how the network would be used or what would travel over the

188
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:47,080
network. Because there was an unwritten rule of engagement that we all adhere to among which were

189
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:55,240
this network was for scientific purposes and not for commercial purposes. As these dot com's came

190
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,760
on, we didn't see a problem with them using the network. In fact, to look forward,

191
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm very pleased that dot com's came in because it never would not have grown to reach out

192
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,960
in all the applications and all the people in all the countries of the world had not the dot com's

193
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,080
come in and begun to provide some commercial services, commercial applications, and deploying

194
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,720
infrastructure that the open net at that time could not afford to do. But getting back to the

195
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,960
approach of these dot com people in 1988, the first worm appeared came from Robert Morris.

196
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,120
He launched the worm and it totally took down a large portion of the network. We were very

197
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:53,720
unhappy about that. But that seemed to be an isolated incident until in 1994, the two most hated

198
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,200
people on the internet, Canton, Seagull, who were running a small, small legal firm,

199
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,520
sent out the first spam. They sent out an advertisement to all the news groups offering to help

200
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:16,040
users get green cards if they were not citizens. Now, this went out, it's flooded the network.

201
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,040
Now, those on the other side, people like myself said, what the heck was that? The network

202
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:28,120
is not supposed to be used for advertising purposes. So we'd launched email back to the Canton

203
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,720
Seagull saying, you can't do that, that's wrong. And everybody without being coordinated sent

204
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,880
these information back, these emails back, as it was full. We created the first denial of service

205
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:47,000
of that network. I like that. It is hard to imagine what it's even looked like in those days

206
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,120
and when it switched. Actually, well, you get the idea there. And there's even a piece of the

207
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,720
end where he goes in a little bit more about the dot coms. Really good to hear Len Klein-Rofka talk

208
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,720
that way, because I do think it was good. The commercialization of the internet did bring it

209
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,200
to every single corner of the world, or at least close to it. And still, we're only like what,

210
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,640
you know, 6% of the entire population that has access to the internet. Good show to subscribe to

211
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,080
great podcast. It's memory lane with Halle Suit. You can find it at IT Conversations.com.

212
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Today, the source code, I'm Adam Curry reaching out to the far corners of the earth myself,

213
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,800
including Australia. Hi, Adam. This is Les Pose and Melbourne of Australia. Thanks for the great

214
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,360
work that you and Dave and the others are doing with podcasting. There was something that happened

215
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,840
in yesterday's trade secrets for the 12th, where Dave spoke about a friend of his Les Williams,

216
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,960
talking about blogs and by extension podcasts, being like Chinese meals, small tidbits,

217
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,320
who delicately eat them with chopsticks, rather than just having a big meal in front of you.

218
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,160
Can I send that metaphor a little further to get some extra meaning out of that?

219
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,640
Sort of bad metaphor, because it reminds of what happens when you go to Chinese yam chat.

220
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,880
Very popular in Australia, and I'm sure in Europe. And of course, in any good China town in

221
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,040
the United States, yam chat doors is where the waiters serve you every couple of minutes,

222
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,960
something you pop out on the trolley and you have a choice. Could be Chinese broccoli,

223
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,360
could be fish, could be seafood. There's usually something for everybody and it's usually in

224
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,360
serves for three people. And this way, it reminds you of podcasts, because if you don't like something,

225
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,880
you just say, no, I'll wait for something better comes along. That's really good. Well,

226
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,680
all have that, or no, any summers will have that, will have something else. So that's how

227
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,000
reminds you of podcasting. Just a little bit for everything. You're happy to, they're happy if you

228
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,800
reject. There's always something coming along. And that's going to be better than what you had just

229
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,560
before. So look, guys, keep it up and really enjoying it here in Melbourne, Australia. Bye for now.

230
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,160
All right, Les, thank you very much. And I'm noticing that there are a lot of podcasts coming

231
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,120
out of Australia currently. I don't know. You guys must be star for good radio for good entertainment.

232
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,680
It's just those Mad Max movies. That's all you see on TV. And then, you know, I can only imagine

233
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,640
it's, it's Molly, whatever, who's no longer doing the countdown shows on every, every radio station.

234
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,560
You must be so starved. And of course, it's so much so vast. You know, it's only the cities,

235
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,480
I guess, that really have radio stations. And if you're not anywhere near a city, it's going to

236
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,840
it's old, the coat hanger antenna time. And something that Les was talking about triggered,

237
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,640
well, it's like, I mean, just bring him my email here for a second, triggered something that I found

238
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:30,520
which as it relates to podcasting. Oh, my second. Let me see why this is.

239
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,120
I have to look at my scent box. At least my setup is going to be able to handle

240
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:45,720
handle me doing this or it should be able to handle me doing this. Okay, let me see. Here we go.

241
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:54,040
Yeah, I got this from in Karta. That's MSN's encyclopedia. And I was looking, because I was interested

242
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,080
in the total market that radio is in the United States. That's all I have as US numbers. So,

243
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,680
because I think that what we're doing here is no different from radio broadcasting. So, I wanted to

244
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:11,640
see, what's the size of this market and what can we do with it? Radio attracted about 8% or 17.2

245
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,120
billion of all US advertising dollars making it the fourth largest advertising medium in 1999.

246
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,560
Although national advertisers can buy national network radio time, here it comes. 90% of all radio

247
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,360
advertising is local. Unlike television, which reaches abroad audience, the specialized

248
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,080
programming of radio stations enables advertisers to reach a narrow, highly specific audience,

249
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,560
such as people who like sports or urban teenagers who listen to the latest styles of popular music.

250
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:45,400
Because many people listen to radio while in their cars, radio also enables advertisers to reach

251
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,120
prospects just before they go shopping. But because people listen to the radio while doing something

252
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,000
else, such as driving or working, radio commercials can be easily misunderstood. As a result,

253
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,480
radio ads work best when the messages are relatively simple ones for familiar, easily understood

254
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,000
products or, and I'll add to this, which it was a wiki, or if you can just rewind and listen to

255
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,840
the commercial again, because you're actually interested in the advertisement, or maybe because

256
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,080
it was actually entertaining. So I'm quite sure I can't be too far off pace with that theory.

257
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,880
Okay, even though I'm living here in Belgium at the castle, we still have the house in Amsterdam,

258
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,880
my mind is already left in Netherlands and left Belgium. I mean, I'm barely skimming the front

259
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,480
page of the newspaper these days. It's just like, you know, why bother? I'm already gone. Although

260
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,640
certainly, my mind have not yet arrived in the UK. In fact, for the past three days, I've probably

261
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,840
been living more in the northeastern part of America, or northwestern corner of America, mainly

262
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,120
because Dave Winner lives in Seattle now. Let's see, I've been listening to Northwest Noise, which is

263
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,440
a great podcast. You can get it from the iPod.org directory. It's, I mean, there's lots of history

264
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,040
about the logging industry and how tech came in and saved stuff and about coffee history.

265
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,720
It's really, it's just fun to listen to and all the local news. And I'm also listening to Koma 1000.

266
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,320
And of course, they have a podcast, which you can also subscribe to with iPod or.

267
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,840
And, you know, Mount St. Helens has been in the news. I heard about it before it was mainstream

268
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,680
on the northwest noise, because it was of course local news. And it may have drawn to a little bit

269
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,320
out of the mainstream now, I think as well, except on the local Seattle station, who,

270
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,320
you know, they picked up a nice human interstory about Mount St. Helens. Meet Billy Jonas,

271
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,960
singer, songwriter, and musician. He loves to entertain kids. And 15 years ago, he wrote a song

272
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,640
about the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. 1990, I was hiking on Mount St. Helens with a group

273
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,400
of campers. He says it was like the song just came from the mountain.

274
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,680
The kids that were walking with me at the time immediately just started dancing and

275
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,920
popping along. Ever since it's been part of his show, who's year Billy decided to put the song

276
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,560
on his new CD before the volcano began burping again. When I heard about it, I just said,

277
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,800
oh, that's funny. What do you know?

278
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,400
Truman lived by Spirit Lake. Oh, St. Helens. They told him to leave. He said,

279
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,760
give me a break. Oh, St. Helens says he's working on a new verse for old St. Helens.

280
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,560
Now she's gone on blow again. Old St. Helens. If this is a proud election, old St. Helens,

281
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,200
maybe she'll shed light on this election. Old St. Helens. Billy, I'm not sure you can't

282
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,640
shoot the true spirit of things. I mean, the volcano has just been belching up steam. You know,

283
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,600
burping. Think of the kids, man. I hereby pledge that burping belts will be in the next

284
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,840
verse. I personally can't wait to hear a Brian Kelp, a couple of 1000 names.

285
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,680
All right. Some light entertainment on your source code. And from the north,

286
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,240
western part of the United States, we go to the other side of the globe to West,

287
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,320
nowhere, Japan. Greetings from West, nowhere, Japan. I don't know. My name is Steve

288
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,400
Henryburn. I've been tuning into your podcast for more for a little while now. And I think you're

289
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,960
doing a fantastic job. Your work is really building a strong foundation. I got to blow in our podcast

290
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,400
and community and kind of organized around in really to grow on. So, tears to you. Thank you.

291
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,080
Thank you. Wait, but do you think that Steve being in West, nowhere, Japan, that he's actually

292
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,160
he's actually in a pod? Could he be in one of those pods? You know, where you can only lie down and

293
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,440
you've got just light and a mirror and a bed. And then he's really pod casting from a pod?

294
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,960
I was especially happy to see the directory that you've been focusing on lately. And it's

295
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,640
really, it's increasing the exposure and the availability of all the pod casts that are out there.

296
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,640
I took a look through there here the day and added a bunch to my list. And it was great help.

297
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,840
Okay, so Steve is talking about the ipodder.org directory. And I am amazed about this.

298
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,320
This is an OPML directory, which stands for Outline Processor Markup Language.

299
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,560
I thought this was going to be difficult, but I am amazed at how many people know what OPML is,

300
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,440
have an application that outputs OPML. And how many people are, frankly, just willing to

301
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,120
write it up by hand in VI or text that. It's great. And we have now, I think 11 people maintaining

302
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,680
their own nodes. We even have a documentation node being set up as we speak. And it's blowing

303
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,880
my mind because there's no single entry point. You know, anyone could make their own top level

304
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,400
and link in my nodes. It's a complete world outline, if you will. One thing is right now.

305
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,520
Adding new feeds is a bit of a hidden mis situation. You really have only the category

306
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,400
and the title of the feed itself to go on. So it's hard to really get a good idea of what the

307
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,920
pod casts is about. Okay, so this is true. What we're doing now is we're the links that you see

308
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,760
in the ipodder.org directory are links to the pod casts feed itself to the RSS feed. So it's not

309
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,320
really easy for newbies who come along and click on that. And then maybe their browser parses

310
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,680
it and they see an XML outline or maybe it doesn't. They just see some letters at the top.

311
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Luckily a lot of people are used to seeing this because that's how we're currently still

312
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,800
kind of doing RSS except for some aggregators, some centralized one like blog lines. And if you

313
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,040
have a blog lines little button on your homepage, people can click and automatically subscribe to

314
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,960
it and you know, coffee cup for radio user land. But we don't have all the stuff, all the

315
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,640
groovy stuff you'd want in there. And I'm sure that's what Steve's about to mention.

316
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,040
I would like to see a brief description of each feed just to get a better idea of what the feed

317
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,240
is actually about, what the pod casts is actually about. Now that info is usually right in the source

318
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,880
code of the RSS feed itself. For example, in your own RSS feed, the description reads

319
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:02,200
a daily audio blog post by Adam Curry in mp3. That's a daily audio podcast in mp3

320
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Now, this certainly is not all inclusive, but it at least gives me the who's and for how often.

321
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:18,200
So I've got that to work on. Now, as the description is right in the source code, shouldn't

322
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,200
be a way to parse that data out? Absolutely. And Steve, I'm really glad you brought that up.

323
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,360
And Steve's audio comment goes on for at least another two minutes. But it's really important

324
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,840
to stuff that you're saying here. And we do have that. And in fact last night, day one or

325
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,800
night, we had a very historic moment together. It was last night for me yesterday,

326
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,960
I early afternoon for him, maybe even still morning. And we both simultaneously bought a new

327
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,320
server. You know, that's kind of like what women do when they go shoe shopping, we're like,

328
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,160
oh, that's go buy a server. And we, you know, we, I'm going to look at all the options.

329
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,360
And it's an IDE drive on IDE, raid one, and which, like, get and how many how big should the

330
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,760
hard drives be? And we're kind of bandwidth. And what are we going to name the machines? And it's just

331
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,120
porn, you know, it's total porn the way women love shoe shopping. Some women, most women,

332
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:10,680
lots of women love shoe shopping. And we're going to really get, get serious on attacking these

333
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,520
issues. And one of the things that is high priority on the list is for the directory, the submit

334
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,920
links should be a lot easier. If you're maintaining a node, you should basically just receive an email

335
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,880
and you click somewhere and all the fields are filled in. It pulls in that data from the RSS

336
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,920
feed, you're right for the channel title and description. Even the logo, and that should automatically

337
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,080
be posted to the iPod.org homepage, totally right there. And we're working on it. So everyone's

338
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,840
thinking about the same thing. And I'm so happy to see this come together. And anyone who wants to

339
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,880
help with this outline stuff, you're more than welcome to contribute. There's a link on the iPod.org

340
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,000
directory right there under podcasts. How you can contribute and how you can maintain a node or

341
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,680
multiple nodes of branches of this entire tree that we're making right now. All right, one more

342
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:06,680
bushism. It's a topic we've discussed before. Repetition works. If I say to you, buy this soap,

343
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,840
it's better than all the rest. And I say it really loudly and with big orange and yellow colors

344
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,480
and white colors. And I tell you, over and over and over and over again, you're going to buy it.

345
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,000
I promise you. And that is part of the Republican strategy. So here it is. Once again,

346
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,160
prepare for a mine control. Repetition becomes truth. In the heart of this great city,

347
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,960
we saw tragedy arrive. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive.

That's what you're laughing at.

352
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Terrible.

When I snap by fingers,

375
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,640
fingers, you'll wake up and vote for John Kerry.

376
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
And, wake, wake, wake, wake, wake, wake.

377
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,280
Yes, Stella, everybody, welcome back.

378
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,840
You listen to the Daily Source Code.

379
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm Adam Curry.

380
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
We have one more song to play for you before I

381
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,120
have to go off and find the gas station or the hot spot somewhere

382
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,920
to go and upload all this stuff.

383
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,120
It is by popular request, Droma Douchy.

384
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,840
This is Here You Are, The World Fingers, the Lumisol.

385
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:14,280
So, one must have slipped the old Stella, me too, y'all, mommy,

386
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,280
cause here you are.

387
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:25,120
In the back, she left some old Stella, below, got sloppy,

388
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,280
and here you are.

389
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:41,240
You're not just a dream that financials in the midst.

390
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:52,520
It's bliss to know simply that you exist.

391
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,160
I'm happy that your happy give the misses, likes of yourself,

392
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,920
cause here you are.

393
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,840
I am afraid to do the same because I'll keep it made me stupid,

394
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,000
so that you are.

395
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:25,120
Would you care for a touch of material for my smile?

396
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Is that when you are here?

397
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,400
Yes, it is you are.

398
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:14,080
You're not just a dream that financials in the midst.

399
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:25,360
It's bliss to know simply that you exist.

400
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:36,280
I'm happy because that came of how the weary made that teeny little dear you are.

401
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:43,760
No kinder than to cheat us on the sweetest little fetus, baby here you are.

402
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:58,000
Would you please have some sharing and sharing a while for my smile?

403
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:14,240
Would you please have some sharing and sharing a while for my smile?

404
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,440
Don't worry, do shade here you are.

405
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,880
It's a lot of me song, and I've got to thank Ivan Roxy for turning me on to do her

406
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
do shade.

407
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,520
I ripped the CD off of them, but if you like what you hear, there's a whole CD full

408
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,120
of it, so go out and buy it.

409
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:34,800
And that's it for the source code for today, Thursday, October 14th, 2004, and I'm

410
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
off.

411
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:41,920
I'm going to see if I can upload this puppy for dinner time as always you can respond.

412
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
That was interesting.

413
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,600
You can respond by sending email to Adam at curie.com or leaving a comment on my weblog live.cure.com

416
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,680
All right, everybody see you tomorrow for the thank God it's Friday edition.

417
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,200
Bye-bye.
