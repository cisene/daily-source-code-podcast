1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Before we get started, let me remind you of the following results or events predicted on these things,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,000
may be very materialistic from actual results.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Doctors that could cause actual events or results to differ from expectations include

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
lack of growth, intense competition in our industry,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,840
integration failures, changes in government regulations,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
operational failures, or looking to take them to represent.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,000
Alright, some of the volumes of today should not be relied upon as representing our

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,920
event of 2015. While we made the lives ofalone the same,

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,480
we need to not to disappear from that same process.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,240
You are dressed in falls lÃ¡, adam curry!

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:59,240
How do you everybody? Welcome to your daily source code. Sorry to be second there. I forgot to turn on the microphone.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Everything's set up and forgot to turn on the power back. It's Friday.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:14,240
And not just any Friday, my friends. It is Friday. November 5th, 2004. One day before the longer

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,240
coming to you almost live from Ricky's right high in lovely follow up with California.

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,240
This is your daily source code. I quite sure of everything I'm going to do today because I'm in my hotel room right now.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:39,240
It's about a quarter to four. That's PM, Friday afternoon. And in three hours we have our welcome dinner and drink.

17
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:53,240
So what's in my shirt? If Dave and I were going to have a chance to do a train sequence before the drink looks like that's not going to happen.

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:03,240
He's busy. He's actually over at Stanford right now doing some last minute checks and talking to everybody and making sure everything's all set ready to roll.

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:11,240
So this is just going to be I think probably a relatively short podcast. I just want to talk about a few things. Obviously, I want to talk about blogger con.

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:19,240
It's going to be extremely cool tomorrow. I was over there earlier today with a four partner of mine. His name is Ron Bloom.

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Who I invited to come out to blogger con because I think that it's time to get something together for all this wonderful podcast and that we're doing and see if we can.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:40,240
I don't know start to start some some organized shit, which is always fun and I'm looking forward to meeting everybody who's coming.

23
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,240
I had a I think I said that in my podcast that I did for Thursday just did that last night.

24
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Excuse me.

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Is I had a great time listening to some extra podcast at about 14 hours lined up and I fell asleep on the plane of course. So, you know, I got all the information from the podcast but I can't quite recall it.

26
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,240
You know what went into the brain because it was registered. I guess it does.

27
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
When you're asleep, you know, you have headphones on, do you still register and remember everything that you're told?

28
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:16,240
You know, that is a subliminal thing and you know, what happens if you fall asleep when dawn and drew or talking about you, you know.

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,240
And boy, where they ever that was so cool to get this whole podcast, which is you know full of lies of course, but it was it was great.

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,240
It was awesome looking forward to meeting you guys. So, if you want to get a hold of me while you're out here.

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,240
I'm at the at Ricky's height. I'm online most of the time from the hotel room.

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:42,240
So, you can get me on Skype or on I chat or, you know, God forbid you send an email and maybe I'll get the reading it.

33
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,240
So, tonight is kind of just to get together. It's at Mings and 7 o'clock. It's going to have dinner there.

34
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:57,240
So, that's going to be extremely cool just to start everything off in a nice, you know, low key format.

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:08,240
And then tomorrow at, I guess, around 8 o'clock 830, we start with Dave's Fat Mountain of Bath tub as it or is National Anthem really to get everything started.

36
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:19,240
And at 9 o'clock is the session start and I'd love for you. Well, you know, if you already registered then you're at the session for pod casting.

37
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:29,240
There are a couple sessions running simultaneously. I'm saying I have the Cribsites Cribsites schedule here. Yeah, 815, the National Anthem starts.

38
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,240
It'll quarter to nine. Then from 9, 10, 15, I'll be in room 2, 9, 0.

39
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:47,240
And it's a boy to get there. They're, they look at blogger.org. There is a, under FAQs, there's a description directions on how to get to, to the Stanford Law School.

40
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,240
It took me a little while to figure out how to, you know, just to find campus drive.

41
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,240
But got that eventually and just went over there and checked it out. Real good vibe, real, real mellow out here, everything's really nice.

42
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,240
And actually, I'm sitting here in my room and I've got the, the screen, the screens open. Nice sunlight coming in.

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,240
The temperatures wonderful, particularly for a guy coming from the lowlands, the flat country, right?

44
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,240
It's where it's really nasty and rainy and cold this time of year.

45
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm really hoping that one thing that we'll, you know, that we'll get kind of synced up on.

46
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:31,240
And as we'll have a plenty of chances to talk and, you know, if anyone wants to come over and hang out, just, you know, let me know, give me a call.

47
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,240
And that comes into my non-smoking room where I am smoking.

48
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,240
You know, I'm hoping that we can get some, some music shit started because I was just, you know, I wanted to fill up the show with a couple of songs and did find some stuff.

49
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:58,240
But we still need people to promote bands, you know, we need people who love a certain band and we'll promote it and we'll send all the podcasters, MP3s or links to MP3s and information and get some preclearance on the, you know, that we can play this stuff.

50
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:09,240
So if you're a fan of a particular band, you know, by all means start promoting it and do it methodically, just like the record promoters do in, you know, how the big boys do.

51
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:17,240
In fact, I was looking at a site that I was turned on to by, I'll tell you who I was turned on to it by.

52
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,240
It was Sam Levin, who's also going to be a blogger con.

53
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,240
And the site is magnitude.com.

54
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Actually, let me copy that right now.

55
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm going to put that into the source code notes.

56
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
So I'll put it just an extra note here.

57
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,240
So it's a non- or AA music.

58
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,240
And this is magnitude.com to put the links in there.

59
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:56,240
And I'll just read the opening bit of magnitude.com.

60
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:05,240
The story behind it because that really tells you a lot about the music industry and why all these independent sites are really important.

61
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
John Buckman is the founder.

62
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I think a tune was born out of some observations I gathered about the music industry along with personal experiences from my wife, releasing her CD on a British record label, personal experience.

63
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
When my wife was signed to an indie record label, we were really excited.

64
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,240
In the end, she sold 1,000 CDs, lost all her rights to a music for seven years, even though the CD has been out of print for many years.

65
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:35,240
And earned her total of $137 in royalties paid, some of it paid to her CD copies of her own CD, which she then gave away for promotion.

66
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
The record label that signed her wasn't evil.

67
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,240
They were one of the good guys and gave her a 70, 30 split of the profits of which they were a few.

68
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
The label got screwed at every turn. Check this out.

69
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Distributors refused to carry their CDs unless they spent thousands on useless print ads.

70
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Record stores demanded graft in order to stock the albums.

71
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,240
And in general, all forces colluded to prevent this small progressive label from succeeding.

72
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,240
John goes on to talk about some industry observations.

73
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Says radio is boring. Everyone I know is interesting music yet. Good music is rarely played on the air.

74
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,240
I mean, everything from ambient, industrial, Goth, metal to Renaissance, Baroque, Tango, Indian classical, and New Age.

75
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,240
And many other genres. And so many of my friends. Yet these genres are barely visible in record stores.

76
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
And totally absent from the airways.

77
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Radio is mostly about country pop and rock, with a little bit of dull, safe classical music thrown in.

78
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Well, dude, this is the perfect opportunity. There you go.

79
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,240
We have radio stations. We have podcasts. We have shows. And you've got to work it just like you worked it.

80
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Now, we don't need graft. We don't need gifts and advertising.

81
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Just help us find it. Send it to us. You know, promote it.

82
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
And actually, you should read the whole thing here.

83
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,240
This is it's linked from what is it.

84
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,240
So, magnitude.com and just go to why I created Magnitude.

85
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
It's the second link on the left hand side.

86
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
And there's it's just good. And it shows you what's so difficult.

87
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,240
And it's a real good guide actually to, you know, how we can make this better.

88
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,240
And each of the songs has a little license next to it.

89
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,240
And you can see what the license is and what you can actually take care of the license right on the spot.

90
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
So it's perfect. It's absolutely wonderful.

91
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,240
But I don't have the time to go and download all this stuff and listen to all the songs.

92
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Yeah, there's categories. But what I want is, I want you to tell me.

93
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,240
You know, please send this to me at amercurry.com.

94
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I did run across something really fun, though, which I've no idea who made it.

95
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
So I'm hoping that I'm not infringing on any copyrights.

96
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
I don't think it's copyrighted, but well, what the hell?

97
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,240
It's well worth it. This is Rick Lyon, Stephanie DeBruzo,

98
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,240
from the album Avenue Q, at least that's the way it shows up in the metadata.

99
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Please enjoy the internet is for porn.

100
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Finally, I get to teach a whole lesson all by myself.

101
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,240
And I'm gonna teach something relevant, something modern.

102
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
The internet.

103
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
The internet is really, really great.

104
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
For porn.

105
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I've got a fast connection, so I don't have to waste.

106
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
For porn.

107
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
There's always some new sites.

108
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
For porn.

109
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
For porn.

110
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
It's like I'm surfing at the speed of light.

111
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
For porn.

112
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
The internet is for porn.

113
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
The internet is for porn.

114
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm doing it.

115
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Why do you think the internet is for porn porn porn porn?

116
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Tracking.

117
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Hello, kid monster.

118
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
You are ruining my song.

119
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Oh, miss sorry. You know me too.

120
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Well, if you wouldn't mind, please be quiet for a minute, so I can finish.

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Good.

122
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm glad we have this new technology.

123
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
For porn.

124
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Which gives us untold opportunity.

125
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
For porn. Oh, sorry.

126
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Come your own desktop.

127
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
You can research, browse, and shop.

128
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Until you've had enough, then you're ready to stop.

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
For porn.

130
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
The internet is for porn.

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
The internet is for porn.

132
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,240
If me upon my hugging me, porn, you porn porn.

133
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
That's gross.

134
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
You're a pervert.

135
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Ah, sticks and stones, kid monster.

136
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,240
No, really. You're a pervert.

137
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Normal people don't sit at home and look at porn on the internet.

138
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Oh.

139
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
What?

140
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
You have no idea.

141
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Ready, normal people?

142
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Ready.

143
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Ready.

144
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Let me hear it.

145
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
The internet is for porn.

146
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Sorry, Kate.

147
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
The internet is for porn.

148
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
My masterpiece.

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
All these guys unzip their flies for porn porn.

150
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
The internet is not for porn.

151
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

152
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Stones, kid monster.

153
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,240
No, really. You're a pervert.

154
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Normal people don't sit at home and look at porn on the internet.

155
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh.

156
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
What?

157
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
You have no idea.

158
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Ready, normal people? Ready.

159
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Ready.

160
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Let me hear it.

161
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
The internet is for porn.

162
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Sorry, Kate.

163
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
The internet is for porn.

164
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
My masterpiece.

165
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
All these guys unzip their flies for porn.

166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
The internet is not for porn.

167
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

168
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Wow.

169
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Now I happen to know for a fact that you,

170
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
road, check your portfolio,

171
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
and trade stocks online.

172
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
That's correct.

173
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,240
And Brian, you buy things on Amazon.com.

174
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Sure.

175
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,240
And Gary, you keep selling your possessions on eBay.

176
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Yes, I do.

177
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,240
And Princeton, you sent me that sweet online birthday card.

178
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
True.

179
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Oh, but Kate, what do you think you do after?

180
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Yeah.

181
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Yeah.

182
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,240
The internet is for porn.

183
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
The internet is for porn.

184
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Ready.

185
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Drive your dick and double click for porn porn porn.

186
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
My internet is for porn.

187
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
My internet is for porn.

188
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
My internet is for porn.

189
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
My internet is for porn.

190
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
My internet is for porn.

191
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
My internet is for porn.

192
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah.

193
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Yeah, everybody.

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
That's what it's for.

195
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Of course, we need an updated version now with podcasting in there.

196
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,240
But yep, always dreamed of creating the JOP.

197
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
What does that you think?

198
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
One of the jerk off platform, of course.

199
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Good news for you.

200
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,240
My potter fans out there just in time for blogger con 3, the iPod or lemon team has released

201
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,240
the 1.1 version, actually got an email here.

202
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Hold on.

203
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Let me read that to you.

204
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
So it's released for Windows and for Macintosh.

205
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Some of the features, it's like podcast feeds by using the integrated directories.

206
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,240
So it's the opml directory from iPod.org.

207
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
It's working.

208
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Ads feeds manually or from the GUI, choose your own download folder.

209
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,240
The feed list displays title, location, download, megabytes and subscription state for

210
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
each feed.

211
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Excellent.

212
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
And hands download progress feedback.

213
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Don't want to check all the feeds.

214
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
You can just check one feed.

215
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,240
It can run it startup, advance options for power users, automatic setting of grouping

216
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
podcast for iTunes.

217
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Windows users, extra debugging code.

218
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Well, I don't know what debugging code is all about.

219
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Don't need that, I guess.

220
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Well, I might, but you might.

221
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I'll also let you know, well, oh, okay, let's, you know what, what goes wrong if a download

222
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
fails.

223
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
And you can grab your copy of iPod.

224
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
1.1.

225
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
That's the lemon team.

226
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
From iPodter.sourceforge.net.

227
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,240
iPodter.sourceforge.net.

228
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Excellent, guys.

229
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Congratulations on your release.

230
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
I haven't downloaded it myself yet.

231
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Since I'm, well, I'm trying to help out with the conference here.

232
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I will definitely do that tonight.

233
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Looking forward to it.

234
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm going to play a little bit of a new podcast that came out.

235
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Just want you to be up to speed on it.

236
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,240
It came through openpodcast.org.

237
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
It's listed as openpodcast.org.

238
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Number 76.

239
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
If you want to go find that.

240
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,240
It's a new show called Random Baggage.

241
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
This Friday, October 29th.

242
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
It's a little overwhelming.

243
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my very first podcast.

244
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Broadcasting.

245
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Almost life on Toronto.

246
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
That's flatline.

247
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
That's really loud.

248
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
So you're looking for a good rock show with lots of cool music.

249
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Definitely check out Random Baggage.

250
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,240
That was a little bit too overmodulated to play.

251
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,240
And by the way, people have also told me that my levels are off here and there.

252
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
And it's true.

253
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,240
You know, we're still trying to straighten out all the stuff we used to podcast and hopefully

254
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
during the podcasting session tomorrow.

255
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,240
We can share some ideas and come up with some cool ways to do this.

256
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
This, I'm certainly not using the most ideal set up.

257
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
It's not really easy to monitor.

258
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Although during the internet is porn, so I'm all of a sudden.

259
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
My monitor fell out the headphones.

260
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,240
That's because the battery was dead on the yep.

261
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
So that was a, you know, that's the kind of stuff you need.

262
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Although I, it should have like beeped at me and told me you've got like 30 seconds to go and

263
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
I could have paused it or done something like that.

264
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
So I had to start a new recording, but I'll just meld the two files together later

265
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
before I can press it and put it up on the server.

266
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,240
So, you know, it's not not the most ideal way.

267
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
And it's, you really only know if it's working.

268
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,240
If you, you know, if you test something and listen back to your file and see how it sounds.

269
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,240
And so oftentimes when Mike is too soft in the sound, you know, the clips are too loud.

270
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
And really it's just a metering issue.

271
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You know, if I had some good meters, then I could probably probably do a little bit better with that.

272
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,240
So working on all that stuff and I came across an awesome podcast, which I'd heard about.

273
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,240
And I heard one of the earlier shows, but it didn't, I heard this one on the plane.

274
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:12,240
It didn't hit me until I heard this show just how incredibly, well, I thought this is amazing.

275
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,240
If you've ever wondered, you know, how women talk about sex, it's not like sex in the city.

276
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
By the way, I think that show was written by mainly gay guys.

277
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
I've been told that I don't know if it's true.

278
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,240
But the super smart radio horse sex show definitely talks about sex.

279
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,240
And you can hear girls talking about sex.

280
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
But kind of the way guys talk about sex.

281
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Well, let me, I'll let you listen to a little bit of this particular episode,

282
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,240
which is the October 29th version.

283
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
It's very informative.

284
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Hello, hello.

285
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,240
This is Cody Shenz, super smart radio horror of the super smart radio horse sex show.

286
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,240
And this is episode, I don't know, like, four show four.

287
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
And today's topic is how to have sex.

288
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
And I have a barrack, but here was a ray.

289
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,240
But before I get to all that, I want to say a couple of thank yous.

290
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Thank you to everyone who is listening and telling your fucking friends because it's showing.

291
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Tech idea tells me that more and more people are listening to me every day.

292
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,240
And I'm really overwhelmed by how many people are paying attention to me.

293
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,240
It's pretty amazing.

294
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,240
It's a special thank you to everybody who writes me emails because...

295
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Okay, okay, okay, get to the table.

296
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
You know, then that's a good question.

297
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
And that's a good question for me.

298
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Okay, where's your guest?

299
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
And then from the wiff.

300
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Come on, baby.

301
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Here we go.

302
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
If you can hear that, that's the special guest.

303
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Giggling there with me.

304
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Oh, just say hi now, where's he right?

305
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Oh, okay, Cody, hi.

306
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Okay, Cody here, last and away.

307
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,240
When we just, yeah, yeah, whiffle houseboys are right now, so.

308
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,240
And oh, and I even had some people offered to come be experts on the show.

309
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,240
So it just makes me feel like people think I'm friendly,

310
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,240
which really can tell you right now, I am very friendly.

311
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Very friendly.

312
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I got many stories on her friendlyness.

313
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Only some of them were true.

314
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,240
So I think the news is that of a new website.

315
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Oh, man.

316
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Very wink a little bit.

317
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I thought that it started immediately with the topic of the day.

318
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
I don't apologize.

319
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm putting you through this.

320
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Who designed the site?

321
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I don't know.

323
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
I think to it over time.

324
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
I don't know.

326
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I don't know.

327
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
I don't know.

328
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I don't know.

329
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't know.

330
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
So, let's see.

331
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Today's topic.

332
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
How to score in a bar.

333
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
And the expert we have today, you water heard a little bit from her,

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
is Rosie Ray.

335
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
And she's quite the bar expert.

336
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I mean, that in a really good way.

337
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, no, I take it as complimented.

338
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Yeah, like for real quick way.

339
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
No doubt.

340
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
And you know, I ain't judging.

341
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Oh, no.

342
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
You look friends for a long time, baby.

343
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Yeah, that.

344
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Me and Rosie have been friends for a really long time.

345
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,240
And I just, I feel like she knows the ins and outs of the pick-up scene.

346
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:40,240
She is a really super cute thick Latina girl here in the Bay Area where we both live.

347
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,240
And I think that she has a lot, she has a lot to say that you can learn from.

348
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,240
So, I'm just, Rosie, I think that people listening to the show are going to be like,

349
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
what qualifies this girl to be a bar expert?

350
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Yes.

351
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
What qualifies this girl?

352
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Why don't you impress us a little bit with you around?

353
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Just Latina girl.

354
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
With my fascinating stories.

355
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Bar, bar history.

356
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Bar history.

357
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Bar history.

358
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Why you're an expert before we get to the show?

359
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Now, I should say at this point, this podcast is not safe for work and not safe for

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
on the kids.

361
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
So, put your headphones on.

362
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
The story.

363
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Why am I?

364
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Why am I bar expert by Rosie Ray?

365
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
All right.

366
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
Well, kids, let's go back to a time.

367
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Where it was 2001 and Rosie Ray was just becoming a legal age.

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,240
And within that time, there was a good amount of years.

369
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
I guess two present times.

370
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Where I definitely explore the San Francisco bar scene.

371
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Definitely, I really, really love.

372
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Two boxes are ultimately important.

373
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,240
When it comes to what bar to pick up that for me anyway.

374
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Even though you're only getting weighed, but the music definitely.

375
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Now, remind you, this is girls talking about how to get picked up.

376
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,240
So, this is good intel for guys who are crews.

377
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Please help.

378
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
No doubt.

379
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
No doubt.

380
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,240
So, I've been definitely bar hopping for the last four years.

381
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,240
And I also just want to inform a quick note here that, of course,

382
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,240
nobody on the Supercellula.

383
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Supercellula, radio-horosexual.

384
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Nor anyone affiliated with the Supercellula radio-horosexual condones under age drinking.

385
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Oh, yeah.

386
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,240
However, cause the rage did not start the bar scene at age 21.

387
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Girlfriend by 21 was like, I've been to all of them.

388
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
That's okay, that's okay.

389
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,240
You know, you know, there's a true fucking nice, a true story.

390
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,240
By the time I turned 21, I was over it.

391
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Yeah, honest, I was just like, wow, so it's legal.

392
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
It's okay, so that's a set up right now.

393
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Now, I'm just going to needle drop, because it's an hour long show.

394
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Needle drop into some tips.

395
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
When a year ago.

396
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Anyway, so, you know, I'm in like, like, the me high hook or boots, the fish nets,

397
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,240
the really short skirt, the like, boobs greased together,

398
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,240
make up whole mind, like, clearly I'm a girl, I'm just getting laid.

399
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm using all the cheap tricks.

400
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
I caught to that.

401
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Yeah.

402
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
I caught to that.

403
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
I show leg.

404
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
I show ass.

405
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
I should hit.

406
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
But, you know what?

407
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Sometimes, like, you do all that, and it's still not happening.

408
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
So, you know, what can I say?

409
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Yeah.

410
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,240
But, so, I'm really ready to just be like the first guy who's not, like, sexually harassing me.

411
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I'll go home with.

412
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Boy, no.

413
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
And so, this really cute guy I'm in the bar.

414
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
You know, this really cute guy is like, hey, how's it going?

415
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
But, you know what?

416
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
He was so raging drunk.

417
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,240
He was like, he was so drunk that I wasn't sure if I fucked him, if it would be paid rate.

418
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Like, you know what I mean?

419
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Like, anyone with any sense isn't going to fuck someone who's like, almost passed out drunk.

420
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
And so, I really feel like this guy would have gotten laid.

421
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
He would have gotten laid a couple times.

422
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
I'm sure.

423
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,240
If he hadn't have been so pissed drunk, I mean, he was like six in, you know?

424
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,240
And I really feel like, if you're going to go out and get laid,

425
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
I think you should be sober enough to be positive

426
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240
that you're going to remember getting laid.

427
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
We take a notes here, guys.

428
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
No, definitely.

429
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Remember Cody, that's for sure.

430
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah, you got it.

431
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
I mean, I don't know.

432
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,240
I mean, slightly buzzed and picking up on a woman.

433
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
I think that's good.

434
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,240
But, really just like, stumbling, floppy drunk.

435
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
I don't know, man.

450
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Oh, fucker the life maker

502
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Oh, fucker the life maker

503
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,240
I will let you away

504
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Oh, fucker the life maker

505
00:27:43,240 --> 00:28:03,200
You go, Oh, ah oh, ah oh...

506
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:12,380
Oh, oh, ah oh, ah oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes get my believe."

507
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:19,380
I'm a fan of you, I'm a fan of you, I'm a fan of you.

508
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
You don't think any of the food or beetles, that's the name of the band.

509
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,380
Love your flicker, which basically means lazy mother fucker.

510
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,380
Some great non-RIAA music for you.

511
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,380
They released it on their own label on their Yovink records, which is just awesome.

512
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Those guys are from a part of the Netherlands, which is still the old old country,

513
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,380
where they love rock and roll.

514
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
They kind of like the Hillbillies of Holland.

515
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:47,380
Just snuggled up there in a little corner of Holland, which is very close to Germany.

516
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,380
If you haven't heard it, I've promoted a couple of times on the source code.

517
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,380
You must check out Russell Holland's trio podcast, mobilepodcast.org.

518
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,380
He's doing something really interesting. He's using a trio, a trio, a trio.

519
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,380
One of those handheld phone, computer, organizer, type thingies,

520
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
which is looking like it's an interesting device.

521
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,380
And you should check it out because he's mixing in music and files,

522
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
and he's doing some cool stuff with it.

523
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,380
And I like the slogan for the show. It's the podcast from the Palm Air Hand.

524
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,380
You were listening to a special post-election edition of the trio podcast.

525
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,380
www.mobilepodcast.org.

526
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,380
My name is Russell Holland, podcasting from the palm of my hand.

527
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,380
The city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.

528
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,380
What do you mean, biblical?

529
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,380
What do you mean, this old testament to the air mayor, real wrath of god-type stuff?

530
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,380
Fire and brimstone coming down from the sky.

531
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Rivers and seas boiling.

532
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,380
40 years of darkness earthquakes volcano.

533
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,380
The dead rise in from the grave.

534
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,380
Human sacrifice, dogs and cats, living together, mass hysteria.

535
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,380
Well, that's certainly how I felt on Monday.

536
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,380
All right. So you get the idea, mobilepodcast.org.

537
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Podcasting from the palm of his hand.

538
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380
And he's starting those bits. He's doing it all live.

539
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,380
So it's extremely cool. And of course, he can make phone calls and get people on at the same time.

540
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,380
And it's, I think it has Wi-Fi and it's so definitely check that out.

541
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,380
I'm going to leave it for the source code for today, because we're having

542
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,380
done about 30 minutes, which is short, but there will be more.

543
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,380
You know there's going to be lots of podcasts happening.

544
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,380
So I'm already paying attention to what's coming in over the wire and downloading stuff.

545
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,380
I potter running for some crunching everybody's bandwidth.

546
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,380
It's the high end, the riot, the high end.

547
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
Ricky's high end.

548
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
In lovely part about to California.

549
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,380
So I'll probably do another podcast by this evening,

550
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
who knows me with some guests.

551
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
We might even do a trade secret.

552
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
It's all depends. We're going to play it by here.

553
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,380
And look for other podcasts.

554
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,380
Popping up live from vlogger.com.

555
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,380
Let's get in for a good diversity.

556
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,380
Let's get to the show for now for Friday.

557
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
November 5th, 2004.

558
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
The early edition.

559
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,380

I'll see you all later from the high end. Bye-bye.

564
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
Bye-bye.
