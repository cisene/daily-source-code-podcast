00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Welcome to your source code for Friday, October 22nd, 2004, brought to you on Saturday, October

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:36,080
Good morning. It's really early here in Belgium. I'm reclined in the big green thing, which is the

3
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,840
chair that I've slept with me for most of my life, a huge leather recliner, a green leather recliner.

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,480
Everyone's still asleep. I was up really early this morning around six o'clock for a number of reasons,

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
which I'll be happy to tell you. Obviously, didn't get to have sex last night. Otherwise,

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,400
probably would have slept a little bit longer. That was my excuse for not bringing you a source code,

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,840
so I figured, didn't get any, might as give you some, right?

8
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,720
So we're going to make a kind of a mellow source code for this morning. The reason I was, well, first

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,640
all I went to bed last night, we all went to bed around 11 o'clock, and I had a splitting headache,

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,720
which is probably cold and dozed. You can hear a little bit of nasal sound this morning on the

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,640
old Kermister. Patricia has also been kind. I was just a flu bug. It's been going around. She even

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,880
got a flu shot, but she still has a little bit of a sore throat and Christina Porkid. She stayed home

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,320
the first two days. In Tuesday, she stayed home from school, and she went back and she was standing

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,720
next to her bed around 615 and she got already breezed. She was so stuffed up and had a headache and

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,800
a throat ache and sucks when kids are sick. So of course, you know, when that happens, I wake up.

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,480
Actually, I didn't know what day it was. I woke up like, oh, that was probably time to get Christina

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,000
to school, you know, 630s when we usually get up, 637 to clock. And I was downstairs. I was

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,880
ready to turn on a morning radio show, you know, listen to some guys I know, like, oh, wait a minute,

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,640
Saturday morning. And it's raining. It's, uh, it's not, well, I'm sorry. That isn't rain. That's

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,880
liquid sunshine. And it's not a very nice day here in in Flander's Belgium, but I figured we

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,440
just do a nice cool relax Saturday source code. Hopefully you're listening to this in the morning

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,680
yourself. Um, and let's see last night, um, well, I had a whole bunch. I got to tell you, I have to

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,640
stop setting meetings on Friday because at the end of the week, I'm already tired. And if I get home

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,520
late and I'm stuck in traffic, it's so hard to, you know, to get up the energy to record a show.

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,000
Even though I usually have everything all prepped and ready to go, it's like, pool. And then

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,320
last night at 9 o'clock, which was 12 noon West Coast, three PM East Coast time. I was a guest

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,520
with Dave Winner, Michael Budraying, Craying. On the Gilmore gang, which I've been waiting for,

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,840
for that to happen for a long time. Really, ever since I heard the Gilmore gang, like, yeah, I

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
wanted to be on that show. So Steve Gilmore invited Dave and I on the show. And so that was an

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,000
hour long taping. It's, it's life to, to tape or live to disk, actually. Uh, so it had to be done

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,360
between 9 and 10. A couple of quick observations about that. So of course, it was about podcasting.

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,600
The show was already up. So please go check it out. If you haven't already gotten through your iPod

33
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,920
or subscription. Um, uh, a special guest is what on the show. And Steve was really excited about it.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
As were the other members of the gang, was the fire sign theater, or three guys from the fire

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,920
sign theater. And I have to be honest, uh, so you call into this, this telephone system right

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,040
and you hear like beep beep and you already hear people talking. And, uh, and, and Steve was really

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
excited that he had had the fire sign theater on. And to be quite honest, I'd heard a fire sign

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,160
theater, but of course, I'd never heard it. This is from the 60s. These guys were, you know,

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,680
apparently they really revolutionized radio and, and are pretty much the fundamental building

40
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,920
block on which even podcasting is, uh, is based today. Uh, so while we were getting ready, I was

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,600
like surfing the web and Googling and trying to find out as much as I could. Um, uh, and what was great

42
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,360
is, and you have to listen to show. These guys got it within like 33 minutes. They understood

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,800
podcasting. They went from zero to podcasting in, uh, in half an hour. And that was just phenomenal.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,440
It's a good show to listen to. Something that was very interesting though is that before, um, we actually

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440
started the show and people, you know, we're just kind of like talking on the conference call.

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,080
Everybody was ranking on, you know, all the elections in two weeks and fuck, we got to get

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
rid of Bush and I'm, you know, the country's going to be hosed if he gets reelected. And no one spoke

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,240
with the same passion during the actual taping, even though the elections did come up. So I just

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,360
wanted to want to say that. That was always, it always amazes me how the minute the microphone

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
turns on, then all of a sudden it's like everyone takes a stupid pill and we're not

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,120
real anymore. So trying to keep the pod cast really y'all. So yesterday the reason why I got home,

52
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,440
oh wait a minute, first of all, wait a minute, I'm making a big mistake here. It's early in the

53
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:21,280
morning. We have to do the brush your teeth song. You brush your teeth. Come on, you can sing

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,960
a lot. You brush your teeth. When you wake up in the morning, it's a quarter to two and you want to

55
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,480
find something to do. You brush your teeth. I do a podcast, a real podcast. You brush your teeth.

56
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,360
When you wake up in the morning, it's a quarter to three and you mine starts humming

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,560
through the lead. You brush your teeth. You brush your teeth.

58
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,160
All right, thank this up, guys. When you wake up in the morning, it's a quarter to four and you think

59
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,000
you hear, run, knock on your door. You brush your teeth. You brush your teeth.

60
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,600
When you wake up in the morning, it's a quarter to five and you just can't wait to come all

61
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:16,400
out of your brush your teeth. You brush your teeth. You brush your teeth. You brush your teeth.

62
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:29,680
Good morning. Now we're all awake. Yesterday, I had to open the eye trends, lifestyle and

63
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,400
technology fair in the Utrecht, which is about the central part of the Netherlands. Not just

64
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,360
for any old reason. I'm waiting to go around opening up fairs, but grandmaster view. Our

65
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,560
flat screen company was displaying our wares there, so that's always a great way to get extra

66
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
publicity and attention. Grandmasterview.com, by the way, and also available in the states now at

67
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,800
florida.grandmasterview.com. And so I was hanging around for a little while, and it will

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,720
a little while. It takes a couple hours before you get home. That's why I was late. But I got an email

69
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,800
about my appearance there, and this is from Yutun for Croast. I'm just going to read this to you

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,200
because there's an excellent email that I saw when I got up this morning. Hey, dude, that was

71
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,680
pretty weird. I was listening to your daily source code on my iPod. When I turned into the parking lot

72
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,200
at the Yarnburgs, next thing, you know, I see you live, grabbing a very red drink from a walking

73
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,440
human video billboard waiter at iTrends. That's right. They had waiters with flat screens on their

74
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,120
head and shit. Since you were sitting down at a little table in the company of some serious

75
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,080
looking people in suits, I figured that it might not be the best moment for me to yank out my

76
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,760
iPod and slap you on the back and yell, didn't source code rules, dude. You'd probably say,

77
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,600
hey, what do you want from me? Visualizing that did make a click on my head. He says, I decided

78
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,160
to send you a song in appreciation instead. So first of all, the guys in the suits were like

79
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,200
company sales guys, and one of them was my partner and grandma's review. And we were actually

80
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,240
just talking about a podcasting and iPod, or because I know where we were sitting when you

81
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,320
probably saw me. So please, anytime, you know, feel free. If you're driving in the highway,

82
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,000
I want to roll down the window and honk at me, or if you're anywhere. And just the thing that you

83
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
were seeing that listening to the source code while I was there, you really should have

84
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,360
a relationship come out to me that would be an cool. So he decided to send me a song instead.

85
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,880
Oh, I was sick. I just want to make sure I've got everything all cute up here.

86
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,240
I was listening to your take on indie music just then. I wanted to send you a song that was

87
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,640
that was recorded by my band. It's 100% RIA proof and royalty free. I do grant you and anyone else

88
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,200
that wants the podcast that writes to do so, download it, share it, any other way necessary,

89
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
all writes and clearance taken care of. However, it's 5.5 meg, so I didn't want to

90
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
nail it to you. That's appreciated. It says, why this one? Well, check out the lyrics. You

91
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,240
probably see why click in his head. I hope you'd like it if not just to take this at token

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,160
to my appreciation if you don't want to play it for it. Play it on the show. Actually, you're doing

93
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,720
I really liked it. And I'm going to play it right now. This is, I guess your band's name is Paragon.

94
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,440
That's what I'm getting from the, from the MP3 file, from the ID3 tags. It's titled,

95
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,840
dig in your fame. This is coming to you from Holland. I'm the source code. Very cool.

96
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:42,160
Do you want for me? Hey, you're a kind of way to be grateful. What do you want for me?

97
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,640
No, the little time you came by, realized that my body's too cold.

98
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm too lazy. I never thought I'd know them to say, no, no,

99
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,640
baby. Keep on digging you out.

100
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,480
So you think you have decided what do you want for me?

101
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:38,800
Hey, you know, you can't hide it. What do you want for me?

102
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,280
Hey, no, the little time you came by, realized that my body's too cold.

103
00:10:49,280 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm just on your back side. Never thought I'd know them to say,

104
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,600
shout out, baby. Keep on digging you out.

105
00:11:33,600 --> 00:12:03,600
You'll find you. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

106
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:28,000
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I, alley right across the goal. Right on your right-line, right on to the goal to the goal, okay?

107
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Baby, keep on big in your eyes

108
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Fine, I'm digging in your mind

109
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

110
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Whoa baby

111
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Have a nose, what I've been keeping now

112
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm digging in your mind

113
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Whoa baby

114
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Have a nose, what I've been keeping now

115
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Babe

116
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Babe

117
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah

118
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Haragad, digging in your fame on the source code for Saturday, October 23rd 2004

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And you can download that from

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Erunds sites, it's for crost.com

Excellent song

125
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Really like that very much

126
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you for sending that beautiful, little present

127
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's see

128
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I wanted to mention that I played mojoins

129
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Thursday on the source code

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And whoops, little mistake there

131
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I said you could find there their website at mojoins.com

132
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That turns out to be Mother Jones

133
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,760
certainly be playing more by Mod Jones in weeks to come because the whole album is just so good.

134
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,480
They have a couple albums out, I only have one, and this guy's really just rocked.

135
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,320
More indie music on the way, of course, in today's source code.

136
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,000
Also, I've got something, let's see, am I on schedule here, am I doing this right?

137
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
Yeah, because I have a whole list of stuff.

138
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,240
Actually, I think we're probably gonna run a little bit longer.

139
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,400
If you're taking a walk-dave liner, take the long way.

140
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
It's gonna be an hour today.

141
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,400
I heard Dave's morning coffee notes, and I was talking about making the show 40 minutes

142
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
long.

143
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,600
And just as he was walking in his door, I said, well, it's 40 minutes time to end the show,

144
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,400
and that really tripped him out.

145
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Tony Khan, talked about him before Tony is a radio legend and public radio and MPR,

146
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,440
and I've been keeping very close tabs with him.

147
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,960
He's working very hard on getting all kinds of MPR people interested in podcasting,

148
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,440
which is really what I want to see, because there are a lot of MPR shows that I love.

149
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,840
I can't receive here at all.

150
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,920
The time, if you think it's tough to listen to an MPR show when it's a broadcast in the

151
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,800
States, try and add six or nine hours to that, you know, and try and coordinate your life

152
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
around that.

153
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
It's very difficult.

154
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,880
But Tony, of course, has his podcast morning stories from WGBH in Boston.

155
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,520
And there was a great one that came in into my iPod the other day, and I want to play

156
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
the whole thing for you.

157
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,640
These are stories that are actually, these are podcasts by themselves.

158
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,000
Tony does, as he helps people with their stories, if it's their own story or gives

159
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
them a story.

160
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,560
But it's normal people off the street, basically, who then record these stories and tell

161
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,800
them in their own voice, and he does some great production around it.

162
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,840
And this next one was so funny, and you can imagine, anyone can imagine this scenario happening.

163
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,400
It's called In the Buff, and it's a great one.

164
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm going to turn it over now to Tony Khan.

165
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,400
This is Tony Khan, I'm the producer, the director of Morning Stories on WGBH in Boston.

166
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,480
And today's morning story comes from a very funny lady named Erica Forensic who talks

167
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,720
about a very unfunny situation, maybe, being on the rebound in the buff.

168
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm not sure what I was doing when I agreed to go to a nude beach with my new bow.

169
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,480
For one thing, I'm shy stepping into a shower naked, much less on to pearly sands and

170
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
in front of crowds.

171
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,000
For another, Dan was my yoga teacher, besides I just got divorced.

172
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Dan couldn't wait to whip his clothes off and sprint into the sea with a giant waping.

173
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
What's this guy?

174
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,440
I thought wrapped up tight in my one piece under my summer wrap, under my wide brim straw

175
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,040
hat, under the beach umbrella, under the nude-seeking sun.

176
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,720
After a few body surfs, Dan galloped back to the blanket and shook his head like a dog.

177
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,600
He flopped down on his back, the bronze gifed to the heavens.

178
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,720
I sighed, entire naked families, phallicked in the sand, a couple in their 80s centered

179
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,400
by wearing only matching straw hats, led over the dunes by a naked docksand.

180
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,480
There was even a naked dauzer, dauzing for naked treasures, and just so the left of us

181
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,440
are rather a game of naked volleyball.

182
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,920
Okay, I thought let's just do this.

183
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,800
I got to my feet, took one strap down, then the other.

184
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,560
Step out of my suit and body slammed, face down on the blanket.

185
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,000
Dan laughed and said, now that wasn't so bad, was it?

186
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
An older couple crested a dune, then made their way toward our blanket.

187
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,400
There was something about the woman, a sort of side-to-side gate.

188
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,360
Dan, I guess.

189
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,720
I know these people.

190
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,520
So why don't you say hello to them?

191
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
Because I'm naked, okay?

192
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,440
Because they're naked.

193
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,520
Because they're my ex-in-laws.

194
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
10 feet.

195
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
5.

196
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
5.

197
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Erica?

198
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Vivian Arthur!

199
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,520
I wanted to die.

200
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Hi!

201
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,520
I wave stiffly from my face down on the blanket position.

202
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,520
They turn to Dan, who will be handed a vigorous sun-cell mutation, jump to his feet,

203
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
and shook their hands.

204
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,520
And this is your new yoga teacher, I choked.

205
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Wonderful.

206
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
We were looking for a few more bodies for the volleyball game.

207
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Erica?

208
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Are you?

209
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
No.

210
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm pretty wiped.

211
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I'm scared or relaxed.

212
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,520
But Dan was already on his feet, brushing the sand off him.

213
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Self.

214
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,520
I waited a moment, then slowly reached back from my suit and pulled it on.

215
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
I wondered why I had said yes to this in the first place.

216
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I didn't even like the beach.

217
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
And when I thought about it, yoga kind of bored me too.

218
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Only cobra, so to Dan.

219
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I mean, please, bumping and spiking in the buff.

220
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,520
How do you keep your eye on the ball?

221
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Morning stories.

222
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Come see you from WGBH, FM, Radio Boston, and we podcast you with a new morning story.

223
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Every Friday.

224
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Great morning story.

225
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Only imagine that really taking place.

226
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,520
And of course, these stories are all true.

227
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Excuse me.

228
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Patricia just walked in a couple minutes ago during that morning story report.

229
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
And she said the Christine is really feeling bad.

230
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
And it pisses me off, man.

231
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
You can't get any good drugs here.

232
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Like Nyquill.

233
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,520
You know, all that wonderful, sneaky, coffee, achy.

234
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
So you can rest medicine.

235
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
It's not available in Europe.

236
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
So I'm glad I'm going to blogger Khan.

237
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Pick up a whole suitcase full of good over-the-counter drugs from the States.

238
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,520
A new podcast I wanted to turn you on today was, well, it's very appropriate.

239
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,520
It's about baseball.

240
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,520
October 21 in baseball history.

241
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Today in baseball history is brought to you by sports history.

242
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Bringing you the most interesting informative and intriguing facts.

243
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
Yeah, the world.

244
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
A little bit of commercial.

245
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Love that sport.

246
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,520
In 1845, New York beat Brooklyn 244.

247
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Okay.

248
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,520
I'm not going to bore you with all the baseball history, but that's a great podcast.

249
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
So, of course, I had this prepped from two days ago.

250
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
It's today in baseball history from the 21st.

251
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
And it looks like baseball history may be rewritten again.

252
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Who knows what the red socks are going to, how about those red socks, huh?

253
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,520
And last night when I came home, and I actually put this up on my podcast feed,

254
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
because I thought it was so funny.

255
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
And I got some mail about this.

256
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,520
People thinking that, you know, hey, man, you can't play this on the air,

257
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
because this girl's really in love with you.

258
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
You're like, you're like messing up her head.

259
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
What am I talking about?

260
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Well, of course, Dawn from Dawn and Drew.

261
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Dear Adam Curry, this is Dawn from the Dawn and Drew Show.

262
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,520
And I wanted to talk to you about something,

263
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,520
but I don't know how to bring it up, so I'm just going to blur it out.

264
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Okay, here we go.

265
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I noticed that you didn't do anything for me for sweet this day.

266
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,520
And I thought we had something.

267
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I thought we had something special.

268
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,520
And it hurt really bad.

269
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
But then I started thinking, Adam Curry wouldn't do that to you, Dawn.

270
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Adam Curry's cool, right?

271
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
He wouldn't break your heart.

272
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,520
And so I came to the realization that you were just waiting

273
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,520
until we were together at Blocker Carme.

274
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,520
And I know you're going to take me out to dinner,

275
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
and we're going to have a fantastic time,

276
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
and maybe we'll even ride Mopeds.

277
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,520
We're going to ride Mopeds, Dawn.

278
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I can't wait.

279
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I'm sure it's going to be great.

280
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
What are you doing over there with my computer?

281
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
What, Drew?

282
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
What are you doing?

283
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Nothing.

284
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Are you sending a note to Adam Curry?

285
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
No.

286
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Yes, yes I am.

287
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
I knew it.

288
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
You can't keep us up the heart.

289
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
We're so busted.

290
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
No, Adam.

291
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Goodbye.

292
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
You guys are too much.

293
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
That's great.

294
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
I can't wait to meet you guys in person at Blocker Carme.

295
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
We're going to have a really good time.

296
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Okay.

297
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Some cool technology stuff, because, of course, on the source code,

298
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,520
we try and have users and developers party together.

299
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Different ways of podcasting, different machines to do it on,

300
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,520
always interested in what people are putting together.

301
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
I don't know if you know what a trio is,

302
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
but it's a cell phone.

303
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Apparently, you can record a podcast on that just perfectly.

304
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Good morning.

305
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,520
This is Russell Hollandman.

306
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Thank you for tuning in to my trio podcast.

307
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,520
For those of y'all who haven't heard,

308
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,520
this is like day three of an experiment of mine.

309
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I'm trying to see if I can produce a decent podcast

310
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:22,520
using as much of my trio 600 cell phone as possible.

311
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,520
As of today, the entire process is being handled on the cell phone,

312
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,520
including the fading in and fading out of music, as I talk,

313
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,520
with the exception of the MP3 encoding.

314
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,520
I still haven't figured out how to do that on my cell phone yet.

315
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
But everything else is done.

316
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Once the broadcast is complete, the way file is sent from my phone

317
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
to a server.

318
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Upon receiving that, the server initiates a script,

319
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,520
which then encodes the file just this morning.

320
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,520
I figured out how to add ID tags to that file.

321
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I then generate an RSS file on my trio,

322
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
and I upload that directly to the server,

323
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,520
and so far that's where we are.

324
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Yesterday's broadcast, podcast, I guess I should say.

325
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
So how cool is that if you think about it,

326
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
that you can do all this from a handheld device.

327
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Yeah, you've got a script running on the server

328
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,520
to actually get the podcasting stuff in place,

329
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,520
but that should be a service quite frankly.

330
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Now what I'm interested to do is, can we do the reverse?

331
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Can we make the handhelds?

332
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Can we actually make them do all the iPod or functionality

333
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
without the computer?

334
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
If we have a handheld wireless device that works with Wi-Fi,

335
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,520
well I know the pocket PC already has an iPod or for it.

336
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
How far can we take this?

337
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,520
How much hacking can we do on our MP3 devices

338
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,520
to actually uncouple the computer part that's sitting in the middle?

339
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm getting pretty excited about what a lot of people are doing.

340
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Another MPR show that I want, or another public radio show

341
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
that I want to play just a little bit for you,

342
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
is future tense.

343
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
John Gordon produces and hosts that.

344
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
And I came across an interesting little gadget

345
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,520
talking about on future tense, which is something that,

346
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,520
well, something that could be quite handy if you find TVs

347
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,520
and monitors in your life and living space annoying.

348
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,520
This is future tense from American public media.

349
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm John Gordon.

350
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
A fast-selling new keychain gadget lets people turn off

351
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
most any TV.

352
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,520
It's inventor sees TV begun as a sort of gorilla solution

353
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,520
to the problem of attention demanding TVs in bars, restaurants,

354
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,520
airports and other public places.

355
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,520
The tiny remote control works by sending a burst of infrared

356
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,520
off-coads until it hits on the right one.

357
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
It's basically a universal remote with just one function.

358
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,520
TV begun sells for $15 and is available only at the TV

359
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
begun website.

360
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,520
The website has been down intermittently after being swamped by traffic.

361
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Inventor, Mitch Altman.

362
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,520
There's so many times when I'm in a restaurant or at my laundromat

363
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,520
and a TV is on and no one's really watching it.

364
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,520
And I certainly don't want it on.

365
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,520
I always thought it would be great if I could turn it off.

366
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,520
When I first thought of the idea of sitting at a table at a restaurant

367
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,520
with some friends and we were there to hang out with each other

368
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
and yet a television was on in the corner.

369
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,520
And the town wasn't even on just the flashing images

370
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
kept drawing our attention away from each other.

371
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
And none of us wanted that.

372
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,520
We wanted to be with each other but we couldn't really help ourselves.

373
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
It's just so compelling that way.

374
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,520
And we were thinking wouldn't it be great if we could just turn that off?

375
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,520
You need a remote because a lot of the television's can't turn off

376
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,520
or unreachable or something like up in a bar or something like that.

377
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Yeah, they're usually out of reach and the remote control is who knows where.

378
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
And the thing with TV begun, it's just a remote control

379
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
so you can turn TV back on again.

380
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
It doesn't hurt anything.

381
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,520
And one of the things that I like about it is it can bring on dialogue

382
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,520
about whether a TV should be on or not,

383
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
whether people actually want it or not.

384
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
And one podcast in all's life.

385
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Adam Curry.

386
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,520
And to me Kasky from slash.review.com.

387
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,520
One of the thank you for the opportunity to place a brief announcement

388
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,520
to hear on Open Podcast to let people know about slash.review.

389
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Basically it's ten minutes summary of highlights from recent contributions

390
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
to slash.

391
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Each day I try and round out the program featuring a song from a creative

392
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Commons license artist to highlight a track that I find interesting

393
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
hope that other people do as well.

394
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,520
I'm also looking for external comments and participation on the audio program.

395
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I've got phone in line.

396
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,520
732 357 3682.

397
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,520
And also can take network based zip calls from the

398
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Assip phone network 74766733006.

399
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Once again, I appreciate your contribution here.

400
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
And I hope that you have a chance to take a look at slash.review.com.

401
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
So that's from Open Podcast.org.

402
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
You should subscribe to that because it's got all kinds of great

403
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
promos and commercials for people's podcasts coming through.

404
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Multiple files per day.

405
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Quick check of the email.

406
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Let me see how to another.

407
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
You can hear the email rustling in my paper, right?

408
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
From Jock Gill.

409
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
He says, hey, I'm coming to you from northeast kingdom of Vermont.

410
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Enjoying your podcast.

411
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Everything they imply.

412
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Here's a safe prediction.

413
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,520
He says, by 2006, every modern politician will have a campaign.

414
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Podcast.

415
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
He says, a bit of history snuck by you.

416
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,520
October 20th was the 10th anniversary of the launch of the White House website.

417
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I was one of the project leaders on this, which is why I make the

418
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
prediction above with confidence.

419
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
He says, really appreciate your support of John Kerry.

420
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I've been urging Dick Bell his webmaster to start a carry podcast.

421
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,520
Maybe if you mentioned it dot dot dot dot.

422
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Well, you know, now I think about it.

423
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,520
What a great opportunity for John Kerry.

424
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,520
I mean, why wait for your, you know, your equal airtime or your radio address or

425
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,520
you know, whatever you want to do and isn't this just great for all the candidates or

426
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
any, well, for John Kerry screw the candidates.

427
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
We only two weeks away.

428
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,520
For John Kerry, who has no time, as he says, and is busy schedule to, you know,

429
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
to actually blog anything.

430
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Well, this is perfect, you know, give us your stump speech for all I care.

431
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Just say something one minute every single day and have somebody throw it up on a podcast.

432
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,520
And imagine, you know, the thought of the day from the president or the inspirational

433
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,520
message of the day, I would rock Michelle and her group walked along Capitol Hill.

434
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,520
I found a lot of people actually in the end of rush just walking first glance.

435
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,520
It just looked like a pile of leaves and maybe some garbage.

436
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
But there are people sleeping there.

437
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Though she counted were curious at times.

438
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Some even grateful.

439
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
A couple of people were like, wow, well, I'm homeless.

440
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
You can count me.

441
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,520
After the volunteers covered their areas, they returned to Operation Nightwatch on

442
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
and handed in their numbers and their reactions.

443
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
They were normally walking on the street.

444
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Makes you appreciate a warm bed.

445
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Yeah, it's an eye opening.

446
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,520
The numbers have been tallyed and Rick Reynolds says there's 12% more people living on the streets in King County this year.

447
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Another trend?

448
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:28,520
The Seattle core count area is somewhat down while the outlying neighborhoods and suburban areas are up somewhat.

449
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,520
When you add in the number of people in shelters, you get a homeless population of around 8,000.

450
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Soaring news for Doug, a counter this year, with a very personal connection to last year's effort.

451
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Yeah, it was one of the people that was out on the streets.

452
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
He remembers being approached.

453
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
It felt good because he knew somebody out there cared.

454
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Greg was also homeless.

455
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,520
He's concerned not everyone was counted this year because many homeless people don't want to be found.

456
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,520
As a homeless person, if you draw attention, it's only on one eight attention.

457
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,520
But he's glad to have helped and knows that the numbers will help collect more money to help more people.

458
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
I was sleeping on underpass.

459
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Now I'm willing to help somebody else because that's what it's all about.

460
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Brian Calford, coma, 1000 news.

461
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Now the reason why I played this bit from coma 1000 news, which of course comes through in their podcast.

462
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,520
And you can find all this stuff at ipodder.org, of course, is I was amazed, you know, Seattle.

463
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I don't know how many people live in Seattle, but I bet there's not as many people that live in Seattle's live in all of the Netherlands.

464
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
17 million people live in the Netherlands.

465
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:30,520
I think the total count for homeless people in all of the lowlands is no more than 800.

466
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Because it just doesn't exist in the Netherlands.

467
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Of course, it's all, it's because of the way the social benefits are set up.

468
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,520
And there's a lot of pro and cons to be said about that.

469
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:52,520
But listen to these people, I'm like, you know, this is not the, this is not what I would expect to hear from someone who's homeless.

470
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,520
You know, there's a lot of stories behind this.

471
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,520
And it's quite frankly when I see what's going on with the government and what Bush is doing in Iraq and the whole, just the fact that they were there.

472
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,520
And it breaks my heart to hear that what's going on at home, you know, 8,000 people homeless in Seattle alone.

473
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
This is, this is major, man.

474
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
We've got a lot of shit we've got to take care of here back at home.

475
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,520
It's mainly music for you now that I found on, I think, was GarageBand.com.

476
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Stars, the big fight.

477
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
The living.

478
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Yes, I am a ghost.

479
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,520
The mirror is cloudy.

480
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
I love you the more.

481
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,520
You threw out the pieces.

482
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,520
These did things we did and I'm just dead.

483
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,520
We've got a lot of shit.

484
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
We've got a lot of shit.

485
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
We've got a lot of shit.

486
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,520
We've got a lot of shit.

487
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
We've got a lot of shit.

488
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,520
We've got a lot of shit.

489
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
We've got a lot of shit.

490
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
We've got a lot of shit.

491
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
We've got a lot of shit.

492
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
We've got a lot of shit.

493
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
We've got a lot of shit.

494
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
We've got a lot of shit.

495
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
We've got a lot of shit.

496
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
We've got a lot of shit.

497
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
We've got a lot of shit.

498
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
We've got a lot of shit.

499
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
We've got a lot of shit.

500
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
We've got a lot of shit.

501
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
We've got a lot of shit.

502
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
We've got a lot of shit.

503
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
We've got a lot of shit.

504
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
We've got a lot of shit.

505
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
We've got a lot of shit.

506
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,520
We've got a lot of shit.

507
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
We've got a lot of shit.

508
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
We've got a lot of shit.

509
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
We've got a lot of shit.

510
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
We've got a lot of shit.

511
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
We've got a lot of shit.

512
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
We've got a lot of shit.

513
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
We've got a lot of shit.

514
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
We've got a lot of shit.

515
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
We've got a lot of shit.

516
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:05,520
I don't let me know, I love the door, but you can't walk away from me

517
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:12,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

518
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:19,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

519
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,520
It's time to make a much stronger way to show

520
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

521
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:39,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

522
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

523
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,520
It just doesn't make a much stronger way to show

524
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

525
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:26,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

526
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:34,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

527
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

528
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:51,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

529
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

530
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

531
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

532
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

533
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

534
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

535
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

536
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:54,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

537
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:01,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

538
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

539
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

540
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

541
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

542
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

543
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

544
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

545
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

546
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

547
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

548
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

549
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

550
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

551
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

552
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

553
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

554
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

555
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:43,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

556
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

557
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

558
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

559
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,520
It doesn't wanna go, it just won't let you go

560
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
I might just be somebody that you can relate to

561
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Or at least somebody that you find interesting

562
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
And if you do, God help you

563
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Because I don't find myself the slightest bit interesting

564
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Give yourself a little more credit there, Jimmy

565
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,520
He has a cool podcast, check out JimmyJet.com

566
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Or find his podcast feed in the iPod or directory

567
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Also got a couple audio comments that I want to share with you

568
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
This is from Phil who you probably know from

569
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Engaget.com and the infamous Engaget.com podcast

570
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
And he's moving this stuff along

571
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,520
He's already known to the next step

572
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Hey Adam, it's Phil Throne from the Engaget.com podcast

573
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Wanted to say thank you for getting this out in a big way

574
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,520
You've been doing some monumental work and I really appreciate

575
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
By the way, it's clear that if you want your comment

576
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Played on the source code, that's the way to start

577
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,520
off isn't it?

578
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,520
We have all this technology and all this ways to connect up

579
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,520
We may as well use it for the greater good

580
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,520
I did want to say two things that are probably of some interest

581
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
To the folks out there.

582
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
First, about last year

583
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,520
I started an experiment with video feeds

584
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,520
And using RSS 2.0 closures to get video around

585
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,520
The bad news was there wasn't any portable video players

586
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
At least there wasn't any ones that are released

587
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
But now there is.

588
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,520
So there are some of these video players

589
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Running around like the creative zen that you can get video on

590
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
And I had written an article about getting podcasts on these

591
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
But you can also get video on them

592
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
So why don't we take a leadership role

593
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
And start talking about that

594
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
And I think podcasting personal

595
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Option digital broadcasting should encompass everything

596
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,520
So maybe we can start out in feeds that have video

597
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,520
So one, I'm curious if anyone has any video feeds out there

598
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,520
And two, if they don't, how we can start doing this

599
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
I can probably start throwing together some videos that I have

600
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
Around and maybe we can start trying it out

601
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Because you know, ultimately iPods will have video

602
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
We all know eventually everything is going to have video

603
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
So why don't we start doing this now

604
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,520
At least having the ability and the people who are building the software

605
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
They can at least start thinking about this now

606
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,520
Well I tell you if you look at the iPod or developer

607
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,520
There are already people thinking of this of course

608
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,520
You should also check out Steve Garfield's website

609
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
He's he's been doing video

610
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Video blogging and attaching

611
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I think he's been attaching

612
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Quick time movies to his RSS feed

613
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I'm not quite sure

614
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
So a couple of comments on that first thought

615
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Yeah, I mean it would be beautiful

616
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,520
To get to that point

617
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,520
There are a couple of things that aren't quite in place

618
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
The way they are with podcasting

619
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,520
One is we don't have a set format that everyone has

620
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
And everyone agrees on

621
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,520
Whereas we have MP3 for audio

622
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Do we want to use quick time to want to use

623
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Empag doing use divics

624
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Do we want to use AVI

625
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
You know there's all these different choices

626
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,520
And I'm not sure that the handheld videos it players out there

627
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Support you know that any of them support all of

628
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,520
You know all of these protocols all these different formats

629
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,520
And also

630
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
I was talking to Paul Bootan

631
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Is that his hyper Bootan

632
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
Yeah, he's a he's a reporter

633
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,520
And he's a I think he's working on a piece for slate right now

634
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,520
And he says you know you too is supposed to be a part of this big

635
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Apple new color iPod release

636
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,520
It's just you know why is you too interested in that the only thing I come up with is

637
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Well, you know if you got a color iPod

638
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
Well shoot you might as well

639
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
You know let it play quick time videos

640
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,520
And that would kind of make sense to have a color screen to do that with

641
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,520
So we may find that some of the stuff is going to fall into our lap again

642
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I don't think there's enough devices out there

643
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,520
And really the biggest problem which is which I'm already running into

644
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Hard disk space problems and and bandwidth issues although they're not problems

645
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,520
With with these MP3 files now any video file is going to be at least ten if not

646
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,520
A hundred times bigger in file size than what we're dealing with now

647
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
And although it's technically perfectly capable

648
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,520
I think that you know just imagine all the shit we're going to run into

649
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
I mean you know right now

650
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
If you are new to iPod and you download it you know you probably get

651
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,520
The the most recent the three most recent shows from each feed that you subscribe to

652
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,520
And eventually you'll receive everything that's in the feed because it you know the iPod

653
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
It goes around and starts picking up older feeds as it

654
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,520
With each with each cycle that it runs through

655
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,520
So imagine all of some instead of having a hundred megabytes that you downloaded a gigabyte

656
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Or two gigabyte so I think we just need a little more

657
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Disstorage particularly and still some more bandwidth before we can really go full on digital

658
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,520
But I do support you know I support

659
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Trying this out and seeing what the limits are now of course

660
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
And it's completely possible the entire infrastructure is exactly the same

661
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
It's all in place

662
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,520
In fact, I put up my was it the daily source code commercial video that caught you

663
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,520
I made for me

664
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,520
And a lot of people receive that since I put it into the iPod

665
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,520
Feed people received it on their iPod

666
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,520
And you know it's kind of funky the way that iTunes handles that

667
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Because you get like the cover art is the is the is the poster frame from the

668
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,520
Quick time movie and you can hear the audio but you can see the video of course

669
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,520
So I think it's all going to kind of flow and fall into place

670
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,520
But still I'm a little concerned about all of the storage and the bandwidth issues

671
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:44,520
And oh wow what are we 44 minutes Dave you're back from your walk time time for a comment from digital bill

672
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Hey Adam it's digital bill from the Wizards of Technology podcast

673
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Of course like everybody else

674
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,520
So I want to go ahead and tell you what a great job job you guys are doing

675
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,520
And putting this all together and the speed that it's evolving

676
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,520
And I'm just so excited to be involved in it

677
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,520
And even just the tiniest little way of putting our weekly wizard to repod cast out there

678
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Here's an interesting thing that has been coming across my desk that I've been thinking about the last few days

679
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Since I started subscribing to podcasts which arguably I might be coming late to the party

680
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,520
And I've only got maybe half a dozen subscriptions

681
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,520
I'm looking here in my I made a meta playlist and iTunes which is very cool

682
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,520
You know how I potter and I potter X create individual playlists for each subscription

683
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:46,520
So I created an automatic playlist that combines all those playlists together

684
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:55,520
It's just called podcast and each option that you add to the automatic playlist is another playlist

685
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,520
So basically I've got all my podcasts aggregated into one monster list if I want to look at it that way

686
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,520
So it's kind of interesting that you know in about a week or so I've got

687
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,520
107 different audio files here. I'm sure you've got lots more

688
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:21,520
It says 2 days 17 hours 17 minutes and 9 seconds about 1.94 gigabytes of audio

689
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,520
I'm getting inundated here in content

690
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,520
I mean I can't listen to all this. I'm looking at my playlist and there's Will Wheaton Part 1

691
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,520
There's Steve Wozniak that I want to listen to. There's the Dave winers stuff

692
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,520
You know all the IT conversations

693
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,520
You know I used to audio hijack Leo show off KFI every week and listen to that

694
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,520
And I don't have time. I mean barely I can listen to daily source code

695
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,520
And I'm a week behind but I mean I can just about keep up with that

696
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,520
And I'm not making a headway on Dave's slasher. I'm not listening to

697
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,520
You know any of the other good stuff done and drew you know anything that you're

698
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Stumping on so

699
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,520
They're just aren't enough hours in the day because if I try to listen to it at work

700
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,520
Obviously I'm coding I'm doing stuff like that during the day

701
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,520
I can't think about listening to that

702
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,520
You know what I listen to during the day just occupies my ears

703
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,520
So I don't have to think about listening so I don't want to miss what I'm listening to

704
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,520
And you know when I come home I've got my Tvo full of programs that it's recorded for the day

705
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,520
And you know and yet I potter X is bringing me yet more wonderful content

706
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:49,520
How do you cope with the inundation of content without walking around with your iPod plugged into your head all day

707
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,520
Anyway, that's my my fuck for the day and I appreciate you listening

708
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,520
And I appreciate what you guys are doing

709
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,520
And it's just like I said it's just also exciting

710
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,520
So keep up the great work and I'll keep listening

711
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,520
Thanks man appreciate it. Hey Bill no problem. Thank you for sitting in the comment

712
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Well, I think everyone is having this problem now and and it's what a problem to have

713
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,520
You know Bruce Springsteen makes a song called 57 channels nothing on and here

714
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,520
We are we're like there's too much. I don't know what I'm going to listen to it all

715
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,520
I mean that's a lugs look at the quality of your problem

716
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,520
But it is a real problem. I have it too. You know, I'm sitting here

717
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
I've actually unsubscribe from a number of feeds

718
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,520
Because either the shows were just way too long or I ultimately found myself making decisions on you know what to listen to

719
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,520
And those would fall by the way side now again audio dot weblogs dot com is still a great place

720
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,520
To go and and you know find when there's new podcast out

721
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,520
So and you could just click on the on the MP3 link there and you can listen to it in real time

722
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,520
And what a lot of people are doing is they're saying okay, and also if you mouse over the the actual podcast names

723
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:07,520
Up pops a little balloon that shows you all the information about that was posted along with the files

724
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,520
You can see what's in that particular show

725
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:16,520
I think we probably shouldn't get too hung up on making daily shows. That's part of it

726
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,520
So you don't and Drew I think they're doing it pretty well

727
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,520
They they have their shows down now to a hole on let me just check my my iTunes

728
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,520
I can tell you how long was their their most recent show was 20 see that was that was that's an old one

729
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Let me see

730
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:41,520
Drew so the one from the 18th yeah, I mean they're they're getting down to about 18

731
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
Some times 14 sometimes 20 minutes

732
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,520
So shorter shows is is definitely going to be something that we're all going to have to start thinking about

733
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,520
And here I am right on us

734
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,520
They were the really long show running almost an hour

735
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,520
Also I think that we'll see

736
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,520
Excuse me we'll see more shows

737
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,520
That are aggregates and telling you about other podcasts that's what I'm trying to do

738
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,520
I'm trying to point you to stuff and we'll see more short form features

739
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,520
But also you know if you're doing a podcast don't get hung up on on doing it every single day

740
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,520
You know this is unlike traditional radio as long as people are subscribed to your show

741
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,520
It's going to pop up and they're going to be just as happy when they get it now. I know that a lot of people saying oh, you know

742
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,520
Oh, I all sudden the source code wasn't there and I'm freaked out and what am I going to do? I can't take my walk

743
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
I don't know what to do with myself

744
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,520
This will all flesh out and it's it's I think that this is just Darwinistic

745
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,520
It's it we're all going to figure out the way to do these things

746
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,520
And it's probably just that we have to get stuff you know shorter

747
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,520
I too find myself in the in a backlog on IT conversation stuff

748
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,520
I yeah, luckily I listened to the wheel wheat and stuff live. I caught most of that live and didn't really

749
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,520
See a need to go and listen to the you know the parts that I missed

750
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,520
But Steve wasniac you know you just got to you got to find your space and hey

751
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Maybe we should start finding time for ourselves

752
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,520
Maybe that's a really good thing, you know, maybe you should plan to tune yourself out for half an hour a day or an hour a day

753
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Well, you know what next time you're sitting in front of that fucking television set

754
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,520
Maybe you could be doing something different maybe you could be listening to a podcast which probably could give you just as much

755
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Entertainment value and maybe even as much news value or possibly even more

756
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:40,520
Final thing that I want to say on today's podcast because I'm still receiving so many beautiful emails and audio comments from people about my mom

757
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:48,520
So appreciated so many personal stories that you've been sharing and I've been you know and talking to a lot of people and so much good advice and

758
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,520
It's just the really is quite a lot of love in the in the pod universe

759
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:03,520
Mom had her PT scan and besides the fact that her ATM cards wouldn't work when she was holding on to them because she's still radio active

760
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Apparently she's clean. There's no other

761
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:15,520
No other spread and it looks like she will be able to be operated on and I gotta tell you we're all pretty jazzed about that

762
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,520
It's still of course still a very heavy road that has to be traveled

763
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,520
But the news so far is good and again, thank you all very much for your thoughts and prayers

764
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,520
And that'll wind it up for your Saturday source code

765
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:37,520
Thanks again to everybody who contributed in the show for the RIAA free music

766
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,520
Please if you've got a band if you've got a song if you're doing stuff

767
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,520
Let me know about it send me a link to it because I'm more than happy to play it

768
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,520
If I dig it of course, and I'd be happy to share with the source code listeners

769
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:57,520
As always, you can leave your comments at my weblog like I'll create a calm or through email

770

And the podcast feed datingsourcecode.com slash rss.xml

772
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Dave and I are probably doing a trade secrets Sunday should be going to look out for that

773
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Because it's a lot of cool stuff. We talk about what's coming up at bloggercon

774
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,520
And you have yourself a great weekend. Take care. I'll see you Monday on the source code

775
