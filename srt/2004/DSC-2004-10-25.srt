1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, so this is the beginning of the daily source code for today, just a quick ramp up in the show.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going back from the shopping center, which is about a good 40 minutes from my house.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Actually, went to two other stores and probably drove around about an hour before I decided that, you know, I probably should have gone to the shopping center to start off with.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
One day, a lot of electronic stores seem to be closed on one day.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Like, geeks don't work on Monday or geeks don't eat shit on Monday?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Damn.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, I was so frustrated over the weekend, with once again trying to group my audio properly so that I can do all the connections I want to do.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, do Skype calls and play np3s for a quick time or high tunes, and do whatever I want to do, basically.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Having this cold sweat always running down from the base of my neck down my spine about, you know, always wondering, is it recording, did it record properly?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And, Dave and I were doing a trade secrets yesterday, Sunday afternoon for me Sunday morning for him.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And it was, I guess I pretty much, well, Murphy's always with us, right?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And I tested a new set up for over three hours work beautifully. It was actually, it was Snaps Pro, which is a Macintosh application, by the makers of WireTap.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And WireTap, of course, is not performing very well, the 1.0 version. It turns out that WireTap 2.0 is actually built into the Snaps ProX application, whatever it is.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And that's a screen recorder. So, what that's supposed to do is record any movements that you make on your screen, and of course, it also records any audio.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And that's why they have the new version of WireTap built into it.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I was really, really psyched. It was perfect. You know, I didn't need to record any of the screen stuff.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, I basically just kind of disabled that. And you could happily record at a very low level apparently, because it seemed to be almost no processor load or very little processor load on recording audio.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And anything you play would just be recorded, then I would be recorded to a quick time, it would be audio only.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And then you just save it out and then save it as an AIFF and convert it to MP3 perfect.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, of course, the minute I started adding applications and adding Skype, even though I tested it for several hours with Skype, you got the old loops.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to freeze up your computer now and give you that, you know, mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid mid, that's studying like a CD.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Skip things sound. And the only way to go out of it is to do a hard reset, at which point you pretty much lost your file.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, the data is still there and it's, it's findable, but it's not really usable unless you go into all kinds of, you know, I can't open or like applications to go and try and repair that.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And it sucked because I recorded half an hour with Dave when the first crash came and we just picked it up and continued from there.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And we did all kinds of cool stuff. Dave was able to come from Steve Gilmore and Vias Skype. We talked about, I mean, we didn't have a great time.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I was just looking at my Mac and I became quieter and quieter and Dave said, you know, you don't sound like you're really into it today.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And you know, I am into it. I'm just so worried about these files and I'm worried that they're not getting recorded.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I wish, of course, was partially true. And so I decided that it's time to take action on the recording situation for my podcast and I went out and got a, was this a Samsung.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yep, YEPP. And it's no bigger than a cigarette lighter.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It holds 256 megs of audio. So about four hours. It recorded at a reasonable quality. Well, it's a 128K. So good quality.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You could encode something from a line in. It has clearly it has a voice recorder, which I'm using right now. It has an FM tuner, which you can also record from.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it has a USB. I think this is, it's a older model. I think it's a USB 1.1. So not a very fast USB connection, but you can basically mount it like an external hard drive even on the Mac.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And you can change a bit rate. It goes in steps, it could do 22, 32, 64, 90, 628K sample rates, which is well enough for podcasting.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Strangely enough, the microphone is recorded in way format, which probably sounds a bit shitty.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Listening to it on the, on the headphones, it sounds a bit shitty. Maybe I can enhance that as I play it back through.

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It was, I opened it up on my Mac and get this ready for the podcast for today.

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, that's it. I've moved the recording function of the podcast off of the computer, so that I'm free to mess around with the computer, do whatever I want.

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Applications can crash. No matter what happens, I'll still have my data safe on this external recording device, which is basically a hard drive.

39
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's no moving part, so in theory, let's not invite Murphy and again, but in theory, nothing can go wrong.

40
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All right, ready to get this podcast cranking?

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, good afternoon, what an introduction, eh?

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Indeed, it did sound just kind of a little bit shitty. Hey, everybody, it's the source code from Monday, October 25, 2004, coming to you from Flanders, Belgium, from Curry Castle.

43
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Welcome, friends, family and world leaders.

44
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, recorded that intro as I was on my way home in the car from the shopping mall.

45
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And I don't know if you can tell now what we're couple hours forward in time, and I just came back from the dentist.

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The left hand side of my face is numb, so I'm maybe slurring a little bit. I can't drink my tea without dribbling.

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I can't talk on the split either, I can't really get anything in, so I don't know how to do this show is going to be. It seems like we don't have all the bits in place, but we'll give it a shot.

48
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's your source code, where users and developers party together.

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So for today, we've got some more cool bits to listen to from podcasts around the globe, also some RIA free music, which I think we just, we should just resort to calling it pod music.

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Doesn't that make more sense, or maybe we should call it pod tunes, is that better or not way?

51
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I got them all off of Garage Band.com, when they kick it off with just the fool from B hammer.

52
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Learning everything I was told, but it doesn't seem a matter, how long I've been in school.

53
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm still just a fool.

54
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm still just a fool.

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I'm in a round world, who has a side to you.

56
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And I stood on top of the mountain, felt the power coming down on me.

57
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I took the walk with the wise man, and I learned the golden road.

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I'm still just a fool.

59
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hey, I'm just a fool.

60
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I'm in nothing else.

61
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What comes in your look?

62
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't help myself.

63
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm just a fool.

64
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And when I see you walking down,

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I know why the cause is not made of.

66
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So the whole wide world, watch me act as like a little third way.

67
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
With every other temptation, you know my mind already is the stubborn new.

68
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But I'm still just a fool.

69
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hey, I'm just a fool.

70
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And when I see you walking down,

71
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I know why the cause is not made of.

72
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So the whole wide world, who has a side to you.

73
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I stood on top of the mountain, felt the power coming down on me.

74
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I took the walk with the wise man, and I learned the golden road.

75
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I stood on top of the mountain, felt the power coming down on me.

76
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So the whole wide world, watch me act as like a little third way.

77
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
With every other temptation, you know my mind already is the stubborn new.

78
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But I'm still just a fool.

79
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And when I see you walking down, I know why the cause is not made of.

80
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So the whole wide world, watch me act as like a little third way.

81
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
With every other temptation, you know my mind already is the stubborn new.

82
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So the whole wide world, watch me act as like a little third way.

83
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
With every other temptation, you know my mind already is the stubborn new.

84
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I stood on top of the mountain, felt the power coming down on me.

85
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So the whole wide world, watch me act as like a little third way.

86
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Watch this and you're walking by

87
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What about me then?

88
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Watch me be your fool

89
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh

90
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh

91
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh

92
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh

93
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh

95
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh

97
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,680
Big damn fool on your source code for October 25th it is Monday. It's 2004 and I got to tell you people friends listeners to the source code

98
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,000
This little MP3 recorder, which I'm now using to record and let me tell you a little bit about the setup

99
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,440
It is totally a a message of things yet to come because I hadn't really look past my iPod, you know

100
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was yeah, just kind of paying it. Hold on a second of my

101
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Light

102
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There we go. Hold on. I want to change the position of my mic on the way it sounds

103
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have a lot a lovely ear mic and if you have it stuck too far underneath your collar doesn't sound right

104
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay, that's much better

105
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So I totally think this is this is just a sign of things to come now this MP3

106
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's actually it falls into the category of a wearable music devices

107
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I guess is what the fashion trend is and it's about the size of a lighter

108
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's really it's let me see I have a lighter right here

109
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In fact, there's exactly the same length as my lighter. It does the same width as my lighter

110
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And I just have a regular old big you know one of these click on Bix

111
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It is higher. It's about two and a half times the height of a regular lighter

112
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And it's known no moving parts. It's all solid state

113
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There's 256 megs of ram in it and there's an FM tuner in it and there's a built-in microphone

114
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So she heard in the intro you can record

115
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
With a memo recorder with 256 megs that gives you about 15 hours worth of recording

116
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'd say in a pinch, you know if I had to I would I would totally use it the way I did the intro today

117
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But it's not a fantastic sound quality and you can't change those settings

118
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But you can obviously load up songs

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And they have some windows software which obviously didn't load being a Mac dude

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But with the minute you plug in the USB cable it mounts a volume on your desktop

121
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And you can drag the you know MP3s in or out so that works perfectly easy

122
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I'm sure that you know this could be eye-potted in a second right no problem

123
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Although there's no playlist none of that is in here

124
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it's it has none of the sex appeal of the iPod that the iPod has for playback

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But you can also record MP3s of the tuner so a radio program that you're listening to

126
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it has a line in and it's not the best encoder

127
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Now mind you this only costs like 150 bucks

128
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I cost my lip hurts

129
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The feeling is starting to the window no vacans are wearing off and I'm starting to feel it a little bit

130
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So I had actually I tested it a little bit and I tested it at 64 and at 96k sample a bit rates

131
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And really had to stick with 128 because otherwise for some reason the mic just you hear that little that encoding noise

132
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And you probably hear it rustling a little bit now

133
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because this is clearly it's just a cheap cheap version of things yet to come

134
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And of the devices actually ordered two really cool ones that are similar concept

135
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
One for day one for myself although much more expanded you can really set the sample rates in the bit rates

136
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can move all the way up to 48 on the recording sample and you can go to 325 on the on the encoding bit sample

137
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So there's it's a lot presumably it's going to be a lot better

138
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But the thing that I like about this is so what I'm doing is I'm just record I think I'm using line in

139
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Which is just a program that lets you play your your input your microphone input through your through your speakers or your headphones as I have them set up now

140
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then the whole headphone output Jesse can't you tell me the middle of talking about my setup here

141
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Doesn't that impress you?

142
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I guess not okay

143
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Hold on though

144
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You have to learn to pee come in come in Jesse come in you have to learn to pee before I'm done first before I'm recording

146
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There you go of course I want to come back in in two seconds right

147
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So presumably the one that I've ordered is going to be have a little higher quality but

148
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
All of what I'm doing is basically just taking the output from from the headphone jack

149
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And putting that into the line in of this MP3 recorder

150
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Now what I like about it is that I've plugged my headphones my actually my iTunes headset

151
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know little earphones my iPod earphones I've plugged that into the headphones of this Samsung app

152
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
YEPP recorder so I'm actually monitoring everything that's being recorded

153
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So I can hear that you know there's actual sound is sticking onto the solid state you know silicon or whatever it is

154
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So that gives me good feeling and I know that nothing happens in my computer

155
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Even if it crashes I know that the show is going to be safe because man Dave and I had some great stuff this weekend

156
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I could go through the whole story and tell you about you know exactly what we said and why it was so cool

157
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But most of that has been lost and I don't ever want that to happen again

158
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know sure the connections can drop Skype can blow up

159
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And you know my computer can disintegrate but it'll still and of course I'm inviting Murphy in the door here

160
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Right, but it can still all be preserved on the on the external recorder and until you know

161
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Until I'm convinced otherwise I think that this is this is the way to go. Let me tell you

162
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Having done our entire reality show on Final Cut Pro

163
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When you're reading and writing audio and video to disk shit just happens and after a while your disk just has to be like reformatted

164
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And you have to just have to go through that stuff and

165
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I'm not quite sure I'm not a you know a disk drive as expert but unless you're using even pro tools

166
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You know ask any pro tools user just to come to point where you know you reach the limit of what your computer can do and then you get skipping and

167
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know with all the all the software that's available for recording podcasts

168
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I you know there's you have this risk look at Dave he has a brand new computer

169
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Brand new this beautiful Sony with seven hour I don't know if it's a Sony

170
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But as seven hour battery life and it's you know two gigahertz and it's fantastic and presumably he used that to record

171
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The morning coffee note you did with a scobl or is it scobl

172
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And even there you know three or four times during the recording you could hear that the machine just like frozen

173
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
If you didn't lose any audio with there's like a minute or a second and a half or maybe even two full seconds of silence

174
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And then it picks up again, you know, and that's a brand new machine

175
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Remember when Dave ran Google desktop search while he was recording will oops that doesn't work you know

176
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So you run into all these problems with the sound you're trying to produce and all the cool shit, you know the applications

177
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That you want to use like Skype or I chat or you know quick time or iTunes

178
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But once that processor starts kicking and you have no idea what's going to happen to your recording

179
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I actually got some emails from people saying oh, you know, I run two applications

180
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I run a backup and a dug cave from IT conversations always runs is running a CD recording backup, you know

181
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So but looking at these little devices, you know, this is really something we're getting somewhere with these

182
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And let me just improve the quality a little bit and put a few more functions in there

183
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And we've got real podcasting devices that are going to be pretty exciting, you know, so maybe in fact this one

184
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I can even even in an adapter, you can plug it almost plug it right into the USB, you know

185
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Damn, it could be uploading stuff and doing that through Wi-Fi

186
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just many, many, many, many, many cool applications

187
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay, um, just have a quick try to have a sip of tea here, hold on

188
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, I know the can's getting a little bit better

189
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, man, so I had one feeling that it broke off a week and a half ago

190
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And I was going to go see the dentist two days later and then I got this awful flu

191
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I didn't want to, you know, it was just disgusting

192
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It wasn't, you know, no, no person with hygiene in mind would want to look in my open, open head at that moment

193
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So I delayed it for a week and, um, and what he did is he took the old feeling out

194
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Or whatever was left of it and filled it all up and bah

195
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And you know how, you know, he doesn't want to put too much an overcane in

196
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Because of course he knew that I had a podcast, right?

197
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And, um, and today was bringing like the dry air and then he hits like some nerve

198
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And just goes, boom, just like a electricity up to your head

199
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Damn, in fact it was, oh, this is a great story

200
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Um, was it two days ago?

201
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Shit, there's Jesse wants to come back in

202
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Two days ago, Patricia and I came home late

203
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
From, uh, we were visiting my niece

204
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There you go, Jesse

205
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Go ahead, you can leave the studio bar now, thank you

206
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Um, so we were visiting, oh well

207
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
My niece and, uh, Rotterdam and we came back and we still had to feed the horses

208
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Now, we, where, where the, our driveway is

209
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Um, you can actually see the horses

210
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You have to climb through like a little, a little ditch

211
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And, um, and then you have to hop over

212
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We're not really hop, you know, I can almost kind of straddle it

213
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Over, uh, a fence, a wire fence, which is electrified fence

214
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Um, and then, you know, that's where the horses are

215
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And you can feed them right there, but it's real muddy

216
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And so I, I positioned the car so I had the headlight shining

217
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Um, and then I took the food and Patricia's standing there

218
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Like, you know, move to the right, move to the left

219
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You know, they want to be fed right in that spot

220
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And the meanwhile, my, I had a bag of your pants on

221
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Which apparently had a lot of nylon in them

222
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I just, as I stepped over the electric fence, you know

223
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, man!

224
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Damn!

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There was, like, all through my legs, you know,

226
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Connecting through my groin.

227
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It was not pretty.

228
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
All right, uh, moving right along with the Gilmore gang

229
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Uh, hopefully you heard, uh, the episode, uh, last week's episode

230
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That Dave and I were on it was all about podcasting

231
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Um, uh, Steve Gilmore had arranged for, uh, three guys

232
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
From fire sign theater to beyond.

233
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Now, uh, I'd never heard of fire sign theater

234
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Uh, and actually was interesting.

235
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It was, hopefully just as interesting for them to hear about podcasting

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
As it was for, for me to hear about what they're all about

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They started in the 60s doing, um, the first, like, comedy on the radio

238
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And, uh, and they had an enormous following

239
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And they were just kind of like, well, in a way, very,

240
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What they were doing is very analogous to podcasting

241
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In fact, probably if they hadn't done what they did then

242
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We may not be podcasting today, or it may certainly may not have been, you know,

243
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The same type of vibe.

244
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And so, what you do is with the, uh, the Gilmore gangs,

245
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You call into a phone bank, right?

246
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They give you 800 number and you call in and then when someone enters here

247
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And you can talk with each other and then a certain point is like,

248
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay, guys, let's get the recording going, right?

249
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And then we start the show.

250
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Uh, and I've mentioned on previous source code

251
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That, you know, we were also free and talking about, you know,

252
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
How Bush has to get out of the White House

253
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And none of that really came back on the show itself.

254
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Um, which is unfortunate, but, you know,

255
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's, you know, when you know something's being recording

256
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
There's different energy and you think of different things

257
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And, uh, and often the stuff you thought about, which might have been really

258
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Interesting or very appropriate to talk about, you just forget about it

259
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because, you know, you already discussed it in this off your mind

260
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Which is always the danger of, you know, radio shows,

261
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Which is why I like keeping the mic open, you know,

262
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Not stopping the recording and just going along

263
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So that you hear everything fresh as it's new.

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Also, you hear that, right?

265
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That was new email that came in.

266
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So you're going to hear all the sounds of my computer now.

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
In fact, if someone were to call me on Skype,

268
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Um, we could decide whether to take that call or not.

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But back to the Gilmour Gang.

270
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So, um,

271
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Loan behold, what shows up in my mailbox,

272
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But a bit of MP3 from the Gilmour Gang,

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
October 22nd, 2004, before we started taping.

274
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And what I want you to listen to is how I'm introduced to the surprise guests,

275
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The Fire Scient Theater, who I have no idea who they are.

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I've never heard of them, and listened to me bullshipped my way through it

277
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Just to be polite.

278
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I had them.

279
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Steve, I got a surprise for you.

280
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What's that, Mom?

281
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
We're, uh, we're going to, uh, answer Dave's questions about the birth of podcasting.

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Uh, I'm, um, I've invited some special guests to join the fun, uh,

283
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Uh, three out of four of the Fire Scient Theater.

284
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Going to be on the call.

285
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay.

286
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So one of them is Peter Berkman.

287
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Listen, listen to that.

288
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Listen to that last one.

289
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, the fuck they are.

290
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They are.

291
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They are.

292
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They are.

293
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I beat them.

294
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, pretty good.

295
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Pretty good.

296
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Can't complain.

297
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Excellent.

298
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Uh, Adam, as you've heard, um,

299
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If you listen to that, uh, nomdex, uh, panel.

300
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Uh, I see some, uh, significant relationships between, uh, uh,

301
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
uh, uh, the first, uh, you know, stages of podcasting, and the first stages of, uh,

302
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
uh, underground radio.

303
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And part of it.

304
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
All of that.

305
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So now I did listen, uh, to a lot of nomdex, and I listened to,

306
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm not going to share what panel, uh, Steve is referring to, but, uh,

307
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
uh, I must have missed, well, he might have mentioned underground radio.

308
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I agree with that.

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But I'd never heard of fire-scient theater.

310
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And I just, I'm digging this whole deeper as we go along.

311
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Totally.

312
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah.

313
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I agree.

314
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Very much so.

315
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It has some of the same feeling.

316
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Some of the conditions are similar, too.

317
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah.

318
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Good point.

319
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Good point.

320
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Similar war.

321
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Somewhere.

322
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Idiot.

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Idiot presidents.

324
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You know, I'm, you know, a lot of confusion.

325
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
A lot of denial.

326
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You know, more of the same.

327
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Uh-huh.

328
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Uh-huh.

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Uh-huh.

330
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, man.

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I did it.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Uh-huh.

333
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, shit.

334
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That was really bad.

335
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You get really conscious of yourself when you listen to stuff like this.

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Pretty nervous, you know.

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's like, I'm nervous about the election.

338
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It scares the hell out of me.

339
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm just, I know I don't get that upset.

340
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But I am.

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah.

342
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, Bush acted the way he did without a mandate.

343
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Imagine if he thinks he has one, or other people think he has one.

344
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Right.

345
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Imagine what he'll do.

346
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No stopping the bastard.

347
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
No.

348
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well, I'm not sure about that.

349
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I mean, you know, Nixon thought that he was gone in two years.

350
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, but Nixon was, Nixon did some very foolish things that, you know, he smoking guns

351
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and all that, you know.

352
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah.

353
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Nixon was mentally ill and Bush is more spiritually ill.

354
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That's a good one.

355
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Right.

356
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, let's save this show.

357
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
See, exactly.

358
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
There you go.

359
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Let, and if you say, let's save this for the show,

360
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or don't forget to mention us on the show.

361
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What's going to happen?

362
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You're going to forget, of course.

363
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay.

364
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
As you wish.

365
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So Adam, did you see the mark?

366
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
All right.

367
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So then we went into some more conversation, which probably wasn't all that interesting.

368
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But, man.

369
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We didn't get that good Bush comment stuff in there during the show, unfortunately.

370
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I did find some stuff online, though, that I think you'll appreciate.

371
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
As a guy named Roy Zimmerman, who's been making some, well, I guess you'd call it

372
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the modern day version of war protests songs.

373
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Roy Zimmerman.com is where you can find all this stuff.

374
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
There's one that's called 90% which I'll pay it play on a later source code.

375
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The one I'm going to play for you right now is called Burn Goodie Stewart Burn.

376
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And that's a reference to the Salem witch hunts when the women were called Goodie.

377
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Right?

378
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Remember that?

379
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You've ever seen that movie?

380
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So, and also, you know, Goodie Stewart is like the quintessential name for a house

381
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
at the time of the Salem witch hunts who was probably being hunted for being a witch.

382
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So check out the lyrics, particularly because it's all about the times we live in.

383
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Roy Zimmerman.

384
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Burn.

385
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Goodie Stewart Burn.

386
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We haven't caught Osama.

387
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We spoke a bit too rashly.

388
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
He just released a video with Mary Kate and Ashley.

389
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He's there in all the tabloins.

390
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He's on a box of weedies.

391
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
In this war on terror, we have caught a few HVTs.

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's high value targets.

393
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We're cracking down on cancer-stricken stoners.

394
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And in cities independent bookstore owners.

395
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Not to mention dangerous incliners.

396
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And self-reliant women who are democratic donors.

397
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Burn Goodie Stewart Burn.

398
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Burn Goodie Stewart Burn.

399
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You know, we love to nail them just like they did in the Salem Burn.

400
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The prosecutor knows what a snap of the beat.

401
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
To prove you are a witch with a capitol beat.

402
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And then there'll spirit you away to your incarceration.

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What you'll be pretty to the latest insight information.

404
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We sure when you unloaded all that stock immense.

405
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
To crumple each incriminating document.

406
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But a person of your gender might just as well surrender.

407
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And throw her reputation and career right in the blender.

408
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Burn Goodie Stewart Burn.

409
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Burn Goodie Stewart Burn.

410
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We know which witch is witch in the oven.

411
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh yes.

412
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You're under a curse.

413
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
A curse that only witchcraft could reverse.

414
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Because every single one of us could be charged.

415
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But something wears thick in near us.

416
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Behold of us.

417
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And give us each a euras and a purse.

418
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And yours is just another case of bait and switch.

419
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Until we catch the one who's really Satan's witch.

420
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
We'd like to build a fire on a fire even higher.

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And put away the shrillest voice in all the shrewish choir.

422
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Burn Goodie Clinton Burn.

423
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's really Hillary.

424
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Burn Goodie Clinton Burn.

425
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We'd like to build a leader of the covenant.

426
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We'd shove into the oven.

427
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Roy Zimmerman Burn Goodie Stewart Burn.

428
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Nice protest song of our times.

429
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I got an email about some comments made about President Bush.

430
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And probably about John Kerry in a previous podcast.

431
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This was posted on the day source code weblog from Bill.

432
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Bill quotes me.

433
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We got to get rid of Bush.

434
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Why always says, I didn't know you were having elections in Belgium.

435
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That you also had a candidate named Bush.

436
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You made a conscious decision to leave the United States.

437
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You should accept your choice.

438
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I suggest you leave the presidential decision to those who actually be.

439
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And who remain committed to the USA.

440
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, I just want to say something here, Bill.

441
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm an American citizen.

442
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And I've voted in every single election since I was old enough to vote.

443
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I'm now 40.

444
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I've been through a couple.

445
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
When I was in overseas, I voted by proxy, which is perfectly legal.

446
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's very normal.

447
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's my privilege and it's my right to do so.

448
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And since I can vote and since in case you didn't know, American citizens are.

449
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Have to pay taxes, US taxes, or at least have to.

450
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You have to file for taxes no matter where you live.

451
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So certain the taxes that may not apply in certain countries in Europe.

452
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I still have to pay in the United States.

453
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I do.

454
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So I have every right, every right, Mr. Bill.

455
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
To say whatever I want about the guy that's running our company.

456
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Right?

457
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Because not just a country, it's a company.

458
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's a business.

459
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And what he's doing with the cash that I am also contributing.

460
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And I've paid millions in taxes in my lifetime.

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So, so, mean or mean her.

462
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And if you've never heard the Jimmy Jet podcast, which he calls the podcast about nothing,

463
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Jimmy Jet is, I don't know if he still is doing radio stuff,

464
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
but he certainly has a lot of radio experiences.

465
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He sounds really good.

466
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He's doing a very, well, he's doing a podcast about nothing.

467
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So he has all kinds of news bits and stuff that he puts in there.

468
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
One of my microphones sounds a little bit over-modulated.

469
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let me turn that down just a bit.

470
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So he's putting all these different comedy bits in.

471
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And he really does some research and does a lot of good show prep.

472
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So he came up with a story about the slinky.

473
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Was a slinky's birthday, perhaps.

474
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, you listen to that story and then I'll play something that has, you know,

475
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that is related to this story from the Jimmy Jet podcast about nothing.

476
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Slinky, the famous spring toy invented by Richard James in 1943.

477
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
First went on sale on October 23rd in 1945.

478
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The genuine slinky is manufactured in Pennsylvania from 80 feet of American-made steel wire.

479
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And it's still produced on the original machines.

480
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It was back then.

481
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Let me see if I've got it.

482
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Now I've got it.

483
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Don't let I lost it.

484
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Here we go.

485
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Q that.

486
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What walks downstairs?

487
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
A loner in pairs and makes the slinky sound.

488
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
A spring, a spring, a marvelous thing.

489
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Everyone knows it's slinky.

490
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It gives a big lift.

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
When raptors are gift, a very likable toy.

492
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's falling in place.

493
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's falling.

494
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's falling.

495
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's falling.

496
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's falling.

497
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's slinky.

498
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's slinky.

499
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But fun at the wind.

500
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Remember that?

501
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's slinky.

502
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's slinky.

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's fun for a girl and a boy.

504
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm slinky.

505
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So I remember there was something I found a couple of years ago.

506
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And I went looking for it on the well-known peer-to-peer networks.

507
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I found it.

508
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So keep humming that tune everybody.

509
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And this next song is not safe for work.

510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What rolls downstairs?

511
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
A loner in pairs and makes the bosity sound.

512
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's long, a shlong, a marvelous song.

513
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Everyone knows it's still down.

514
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
What fits in a sock feels better than a cock.

515
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And unlike a man, it's slow.

516
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It vibrates a bit.

517
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's great on a clip.

518
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Everyone knows it's still down.

519
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's still down.

520
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's still down.

521
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's big.

522
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's flushy.

523
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's ripped.

524
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's still down.

525
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's still down.

526
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes.

527
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That's right.

528
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's ripped.

529
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What fits in your cracks.

530
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And even in abstracts.

531
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The penis you don't have to blow.

532
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
They're not just for gays.

533
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They use double rays.

534
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Everyone knows it's still down.

535
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
A dildo dog.

536
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
A dildo plain.

537
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Many more vibrating toys.

538
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You turn the knob.

539
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
They buzz and才 leaves.

540
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Creating girls and boys.

541
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes.

542
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's right, folk.

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Dildo brand Dildo's aren't just for women anymore.

544
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,120
We also make a long line of

545
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,100
what a place

546
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:28,880
Weiterless,

547
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,100
everyone knows it's still down

548
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,400
a long-flushy tube

549
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
use oil they flew

550
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,800
not just for the neighborhood hose

551
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,740
for a girl on the go

552
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,960
with her time for about

553
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,620
it makes for her

554
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,020
fake failure

555
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,620
that

556
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:53,860
It's not over, hold on. It gets better.

557
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,220
And try new, my first deal though, for kids.

558
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
I told you it got better.

559
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Some of those not exactly showin' batteries not included.

560
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,820
Not be used as a full rotation by some animal testing has occurred.

561
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,060
Please use a lubricant insert around it in first, not for use in the shower.

562
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,180
Make those choking, if you use them properly.

563
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,220
Bachelors, flat chillins may ensue.

564
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,420
If swallowed, do not induce vomiting.

565
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,260
This continued use, if irritation or abnormal swelling occur,

566
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,220
mean you're sliverin' thing in the middle.

567
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,260
Don't look random, it's have consequences.

568
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,060
Some are recurring animals.

569
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,500
Do not use excessive force while inserting to the low.

570
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,460
Make explosive place and fire.

571
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,700
Don't look random, it's not intended to replace the male sexual organ.

572
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,020
Only with a temporary substitute when a penis is not readily available.

573
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,420
Okay, I hope the levels are okay on the show.

574
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,620
It's a long second.

575
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,860
I hope the levels are alright on the show.

576
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,100
You might have to turn it up or down here and there.

577
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,060
And I see that we're about 36 minutes into the show today.

578
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,340
I had more things queued up, but you know what?

579
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,900
We'll just play all of that on tomorrow's source code,

580
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,420
because there's so many cool things just coming from left and right.

581
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,140
Just a reminder about a couple of things.

582
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,820
If you want to check out the latest episodes of all new podcasts,

583
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,300
that is audio.weblogs.com and look for the ping form.

584
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,540
If you don't know, and if you're not on that list,

585
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,940
and you want to be on the list, you can use the ping form.

586
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,100
You can use blogging tools to ping audio.weblogs.com

587
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,860
so that your new podcast will show up automatically.

588
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,260
I potted out org, new entries to the directory,

589
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,660
and there's a whole new slew waiting in the cache,

590
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,100
and if anyone wants to take over a node and wants to manage that,

591
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,740
let me know, send me an email.

592
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,260
If I don't get back to you in like 24 hours, send me another email.

593
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,660
Okay, because these days I've gotten almost the custom

594
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,900
to having to go through the junk folder, you know,

595
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,420
pick stuff out of there and it's just, it's a lot.

596
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,700
So the more nodes that can be maintained by other people, you know,

597
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
the better, so please let me know.

598
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,420
All you have to do is to be able to create an OPML file.

599
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,140
And a little plug for iPotter X, I was given a beta,

600
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,380
it was like beta 2, 2, 1 or something.

601
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,780
And right there, it was amazing to see, I fired up the application,

602
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,500
they've got top picks, what's new, they've got categories,

603
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,620
they're sucking in the entire OPML directory from iPotter.org.

604
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,580
They're not following all of the links yet, but that's the next step

605
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,340
in the next beta release.

606
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,980
And I'm really excited because now we'll send this application

607
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,580
is doing so much more for me, you know,

608
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,980
I can just stay with it in one place and listen to

609
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,460
previews of podcasts and subscribe right there.

610
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,260
Of course, since they have the entire directory imported

611
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,180
into the iPotter X application, it's real simple for them

612
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,900
to make the subscription process roll really smoothly.

613
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,260
So kudos to Ray and to August, it's really, really looking good.

614
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,620
Don and Drew ran out of bandwidth, but it happened,

615
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,300
these things always happened during the weekend.

616
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,420
So it shouldn't be a problem getting more bandwidth up for my offer

617
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,580
to host something for them, but I think they probably just,

618
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,660
they probably enjoyed the break anyway.

619
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,460
So we'll leave it at that for the source code for today.

620
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,020
Gonna leave you with one song that I found also from garageband.com,

621
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,020
which is an official pod tunes and pod music that we're allowed to play.

622
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,460
Dan Show, a city and me, as we roll it out on a mellow note for

623
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,220
the source code from 1A October 25th, 2004.

624
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:12,100
I look out my window and watch the phone ring.

625
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:22,180
It makes me feel better somehow when I'm same and though it's been so

626
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:27,940
good to know them, I know where else I

627
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:35,940
there's a rainbow somewhere out there, the one that I

628
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,580
from a springtime in the city for me.

629
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,620
North winds keep blowing on the back to my groove.

630
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:02,900
I used to feel safe there, but now I need room I wasn't

631
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,900
needed someone like them to share my quote on.

632
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:22,340
Now I'm growing like a flower I'm ready to start a springtime for the city and me.

633
00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:08,020
So come on bread and stay and look in so great and I'm

634
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:17,380
understand and you're feeling that way, oh there's a new sun on the sky.

635
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:25,940
This way now for you, I think we better get a home now, I'm

636
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:35,140
needing it too, a springtime in the city for me.

637
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:51,060
There'll be a springtime for the city and me.

638
00:40:51,060 --> 00:41:07,140
Oh man, in that pretty, unsigned band, ladies and gentlemen,

639
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,940
dance show, city and me, you can check out all about the band and

640
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,300
check out their site and everything on garageband.com, really

641
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,820
gotten into garageband.com because they tell you right there, you know,

642
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,660
you can use their music, you can download a track, actually this one I couldn't download,

643
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,260
so I hijacked the audio from from real audio, so I didn't really have the quality that I wanted.

644
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,460
I was going to wind up the show, you know, but I just I really love to test doing a sky,

645
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:38,420
let's let's be a noxious, let's make a skype call the day, hold on a second, let's

646
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:46,500
get some dialing music here, okay, here we'll play a radio trick on him.

647
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,020
Hey Dave Winner, Dave Winner, which is a favorite podcast?

648
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,340
No, what's the name of you at the favorite podcast?

649
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,100
Yeah, you win yourself an MP3 player down in Dave?

650
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:12,180
And that's it for the source code for Monday, October 25th, 2004.

651
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,340
