1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the source code and it is Tuesday August 24th 2004 coming to you from Curry Castle

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,700
in Belgium which well this may be the last week it's actually called Curry Castle but

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:29,100
I have more news about that later and then apology right up front yesterday I signed

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,900
off on the show by saying we'll see you tomorrow on Wednesday in the middle of

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,460
the week hump day yeah right I guess I was extremely tired so tomorrow of course

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,140
will be Wednesday today was another well very busy day Patricia and I were

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,420
interviewed by Rina Ulamans who does a show here called Pulse which is I'm

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:56,940
trying to think when you compare it to well and it's they do a profile of us

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,140
and they do a profile of the guest every single week and so they're starting up

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,940
the first new

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,040
show of the new series September 4th and we're going to be in it. So he was there at the radio

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,920
show in the morning. The camera crew was there at quarter to six as I arrived at the studio.

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,760
And well, I can't wait to see how I actually look at that time in the morning.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:27,880
Let's see just a brief rundown of stuff that's been going on. Oh, I see that Joe Ito obviously

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,880
caught the source code maybe a day or a couple days after I published it. I don't know if you

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,640
remember I mentioned that he had a video of the rocket car of death. The death-defying stunt that

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,760
I performed for ABC's Circus of the Stars looks like he doesn't have the video anymore and he's

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,120
actually put the word out to see if anyone still has it. I wish I wish I could find a copy of that.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,760
It's one of my favorite quick times. I don't really have a theme for today's show other than

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,880
or just a couple of loose thoughts that I put together. One thing that I've that I noticed in the

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm gonna open up a soda here.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,120
Ahh... have a coconut smile.

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next video. Bye!

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,600
One thing I noticed with the development work that I've been doing, and I've had glasses

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,320
since I was 18 or 19.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I probably should have had them for a couple of years prior to that, but just never really

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
knew.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Currently negative to 7, 2.75, negative 2.0.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
And I did through the radio station.

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,280
There's a big chain store of eyeglassware and contact lenses.

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,560
And they needed someone to do a promo for them that was going to last a week.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,960
And I said, what the hell?

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,440
Why don't you give me a year's supply of contact lenses?

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,040
Because I've been wearing contact lenses for, oh man, the past 15 years probably.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,520
And so they said, well, you know what?

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,480
We're so happy that you're going to do that for us.

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
We're going to give you the contact lenses.

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,160
We've got these new plasma-ized, whatever, extended wear.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,160
We're going to give you a new pair of regular glasses and a pair of sunglasses as well, which

40
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,480
will be sunglasses cut to my street.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:24,900
strength. And so, you know, we really went through, I normally have no patience for that.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,700
I had the ugliest pair of glasses up until now in just a reserve pair, you know, from

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,620
bottom in 1972 that are about to come back into fashion. So it really took our time

44
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,220
and picked up some nice frames and really looked at the color of the glass for the sunglasses

45
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,100
and went through all the motions. So I've been wearing my new glasses. I haven't been

46
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,940
wearing the contact lenses for a couple weeks now. And what I've really noticed, because

47
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,020
I did put in some lenses the other day, is it makes a difference. Glasses just work better.

48
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,540
The technology of contact still hasn't made it as far as I'm concerned. Particularly

49
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,900
driving, I notice a big difference. And really, we've gone through all the motions of getting

50
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,380
just the right type of lenses for my eye and curvature and whatever. There's just no comparison.

51
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,580
And particularly when it comes to developing and doing stuff on the computer, the clarity

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,980
on the screen. It's also big big

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,080
different. And I wonder if anyone else had experienced that the difference between looking

54
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,760
at a screen and working and even driving with contact lenses or glasses. To me, big difference.

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,560
On the development front, you probably seen on my web blog, I've posted a list of the current

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,080
iPod or scripts that are starting to be a part of the iPod platform, which we seem to be somehow

57
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,680
cobbling together. I've been running David's Get Enclosures Pearl script. I've installed it as a

58
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,440
Cron script. I had to tweak out some stuff because it was looking for the feeds file and couldn't find

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,960
it the way I'd set up the Cron job. So fix that. And it's happily running twice a day. I set it up

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,680
for 3 a.m. So that's just before I get up. And so, you know, if anything needs to be downloaded,

61
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,200
be ready for me before I leave it for 30. And then it runs at 6 o'clock because I always, you know,

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,840
check after dinner.

63
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,480
And it's working great.

64
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,400
And it's giving me some ideas about how I can continue to update the Apple version of

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,540
the iPod or Apple script.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And let's see, got a piece of mail that I wanted to share with you.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh yeah, this is from Gordon, from Gordon.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And Gordon says he's been listening to the source code.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And he did send me an email earlier about the size of the audio files.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Of course, now that I've got a new recording system set up,

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
which I think the quality is way far superior to the Mac.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And the mic isn't crapping out.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And it's really a nice sound to it.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
As he was complaining that he has to download the source code on a regular modem link,

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and it takes an hour and 45 minutes.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And he says, well, he only finished just before I left my drive to work.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And he really would like me to down sample to my usual 64 kilobit sample rate instead of 160.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But I did want to talk about that for a second because I think this is exactly the point.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,400
If we can set up these scripts like iPod or to run at night.

80
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,500
and just be reliable about it and just make sure that it happens.

81
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,460
It shouldn't matter if it takes an hour and 45 minutes

82
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,820
or five hours and 45 minutes as long as you sleep long enough

83
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,220
and have it set up to run when you're asleep.

84
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,900
I think that's the beauty of it.

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,020
And the way it shouldn't work,

86
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,260
and which is exactly why I like the Get Enclosures Pearl script,

87
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,060
is that you hit a button and wait for it to come in.

88
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,140
This has to be running automatically on your machine,

89
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,220
you have to forget about it.

90
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,220
That's why I like Pearl script and shell scripts

91
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,500
and Python scripts is because you don't have to launch

92
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,340
an application.

93
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,100
It's not sitting there in your face saying,

94
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,700
hi, I'm running, I don't want to forget about it.

95
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,100
I want another application, namely iTunes,

96
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,420
to pop up and say, hey, I got some new stuff.

97
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,660
Good morning, I'm ready for your drive.

98
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,780
So a little bit of pushback on that,

99
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,340
their dog now on the other hand.

100
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,620
Doug says that he's written,

101
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,260
he removed three lines of code

102
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,980
has rewritten Dave Sloshers getting closure.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and it works on Linux now.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So I hope he publishes that, looking forward to it.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Of course, I'll link to that, so we have yet another platform coming on board.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And what we need now, of course, is we need Windows.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I have no idea how to do it.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm lost.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And of course, I can operate Windows.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I have a Windows machine here, but I have no idea if there's an equivalent to Apple script.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think there's something called Windows Scripting Host or something like that.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Maybe we can use that, but then we still have our devices problem.

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Sure, there's lots of iPods out there and lots of iTunes floating around.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But can we write for all different MP3 playing devices?

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Or maybe we should write for iTunes and have, and hopefully iTunes will start syncing up with all these devices.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We really need to get to the point where people like Gordon don't have to think about how long it's downloading.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,440
It takes 10 minutes or it takes several hours.

118
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
We'll get to that point.

119
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,540
We're going to get to the point where it's going to be video and there's all other kinds

120
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,340
of issues we have to look at.

121
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,060
But same thing, it's just going to take time to download.

122
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,820
And that's this time shifting, this magical bandwidth that we create while we're sleeping.

123
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,460
We use time that we wouldn't use otherwise than sleeping.

124
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,580
And so let's put that time to some good use.

125
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,300
So that's from the old email bag that of what is not span that comes in.

126
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,740
I told you, I don't know if I mentioned that we went to Christina's school, her new school,

127
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,760
I think I did about the Antwerp International School.

128
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,220
And we were looking at the list of stuff she has to have, what pens and pencils and agenda.

129
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,740
And of course you can buy that in the campus bookstore.

130
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:35,980
But they also require that each kid has a 128 megabyte USB plug-in drive.

131
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,020
And one of those keychain things you put in your pocket.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,440
and they actually sell them on campus.

133
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,960
And this is a part of how the schooling system works here now

134
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,360
with the international school.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,480
You take your work home on your USB portable drive.

136
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
I just blew me away.

137
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,960
I thought that was extremely cool.

138
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,960
So to wind up today, I want to play a song of the day

139
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,600
and it's an appropriate one,

140
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
because I think that we have sold the house.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
We've gotten down to the final 50,000 on the price.

142
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,120
So that's just a matter of whose dick is bigger.

143
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,880
Of course it would be mine.

144
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,920
And with a little bit of luck, I'll have news

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,000
that we are going to start our move and get everything in motion

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
very, very soon.

147
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,360
And Patricia and I were just talking about it.

148
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
And of course we've walked through.

149
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,960
We have about 20 acres worth of land here and gardens.

150
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,080
And we are definitely going to miss this place, that's for sure.

151
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,440
And we've moved several times before and we like it and we like moving to new challenges and new things.

152
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,780
but we never quite had a nature resort like house like this one. If I could pick it up

153
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,300
and move it to the UK, I would in a heartbeat. So this is a song that I think anyone who's

154
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,740
ever moved and we probably all have it one point or another. You probably feel a bit

155
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,980
like this song describes.

156
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:14,780
I like the fire. You place the flowers in the vase that you bore today.

157
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:32,580
Steering at the fire, the flowers, flowers, my eyes. They go to the stars all night long.

158
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:42,020
Only for me.
