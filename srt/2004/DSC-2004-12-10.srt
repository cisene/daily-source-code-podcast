1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
Well, everybody, welcome to the thank god and spread edition of the daily source code.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,000
My name is Adam Curry coming to you partially from the cottage in the UK from Curry Cottage

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and we're about to go to a new location, actually studio A8.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So here's the deal.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I was scheduled to be interview today for Wired Magazine, which I presume was all about podcasting.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Anly knew it, came to Guildford and she actually turned out that they're doing a whole big piece on radio for Wired Magazine

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and that they're actually featuring me and part of that is podcast.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That was all about podcasting, but turned out to be a semi-profile on me, so of course it took me much longer than expected.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It took me hours to talk about myself, you know how that goes.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So after about three hours of pushing room, hanging out at Starbucks and talking about my life,

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
of course, eventually the question came, can I watch it do a podcast?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I said no, no, you cannot watch me do a podcast, you can be in a podcast with me.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And this is not the right place at Starbucks, at least because, you know, I have two headphones and really close micang because of all the noise.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So I suggest that we then walk up to the parking spot where I have the Audi and we use the A8 studio to record a little show.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And it turned into kind of me interviewing Annely and she interviewing me and what we talked about all kinds of stuff, like start fucking, and well you name it.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In fact, you're going to enjoy it right now. Today is Friday, source code.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Enjoy.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, so perfect point to slide into the beginning of the podcast from the A8 studio A8 in overlooking downtown Guildford.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What does that mean studio A8?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That means that I'm sitting in the car studio.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have a little bit too much reverb actually for the car studio.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I turned the reverb off.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ah, much better.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here with Annely.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Do you want to be identified as...

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sure, you can identify me however you want.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
As a journalist here today from Wired Magazine.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, that's right.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And we've just sat in Starbucks for...

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't believe we sat there for about three hours.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And actually, we're not sticky or there's no problems.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, when I got up, I did feel the chair, like kind of the covering lifted up with me as I stood up.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I noticed that girl who then said, okay, please sit there.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Didn't she say that immediately?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She did.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She wanted our seat.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Cause next to the outlet.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Outlet.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, the power.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Electronic power.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So Annely came...

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, we've been in contact for about a week or so.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And she asked if she could come and interview me.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I figured it was more about podcasting than anything,

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but now that we just spent three hours talking about me.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, that's what I was telling you.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about himself.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm good at that.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, he's, yeah.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can tell.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's what the Saliliqui is all about.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's a practice, a practice self storyteller.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Story.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, no, no.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You know, that's interesting because...

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because that is what I've done my entire life.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The minute you put on a pair of headphones and you have a microphone,

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you're kind of talking to yourself.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I've always imagined that there's probably one other person listening.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Whether there were thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands,

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or perhaps millions where they were watching on TV.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it feels no different to this...

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The podcasting or being on MTV.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In fact, on MTV was even easier.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you know that actually that we all were kind of talking to the crew?

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They were standing right next to the goddamn camera.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The guy, you know, the camera up would, you know,

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you could see and put his head around smiling or whatever.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Or the associate producer who would be there, you know,

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
trying to make sure that you're saying all the right things

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or hitting all the promotional items.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And basically just be talking to them.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And you feel good right when they laugh and stuff like that.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want the camera got a laugh.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How did you know that?

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Did you watch enough MTV to pick up on that?

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's true. You can tell that it's playing right to the camera.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Totally.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And I see some of that now.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you remember when E started up and E was kind of like

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
MTV of entertainment before turning to what it is now?

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because that was started by Lee Masters,

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
who was kicked out of MTV by John Reardon,

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
just some inside dirt there.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And it was exactly the same thing.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're doing all this entertainment news,

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but basically laughing with the camera crew

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
trying to, you know, get a rapport going.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so we essentially had the same thing with podcasting.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Only the feedback doesn't necessarily come from the camera crew.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It comes from, you know, the podcasters themselves.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And the e-mail listeners.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The e-mail, well, you just, we just went through

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
some of my, my production that I, that I do for the show

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
with basically scanning the e-mail downloading all the MP3s.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I haven't had a chance to listen to everything.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I might put some of those things on the next show.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But I just wanted to figure out what exactly you're doing.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Because you, I mean, you must, first of all,

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you had something else to do, right?

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It wasn't just, you didn't just come over all the way

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
to, to Guilford just for me.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But no, I was just in Guilford for you.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I, I can go for it.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But you went London for other things, right?

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There was other stuff you could do.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I came all the way to London just for you Adam.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Really?

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And you're not shitting me, right?

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, I'm totally not.

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't change it because we had a really good rapport

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
because it's totally true.

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I flew all the way out to London.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And it's like, I'm so paid for me to come out and talk to you.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Who?

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Uncle Sy.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Uncle Sy?

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, he's the, is he the dude?

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He's the dude.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And wired?

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So, he's not the founder of wired.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, no.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He just owns it.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He owns Condonast.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, okay.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So he actually personally?

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, he didn't personally call me and say, hey.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Condonast.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But that's Condonast is like big.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They own, like, lots of languages.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can't even, I'm like a fly on his shoe.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Like he has no idea.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't put yourself down like that.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, I mean, on size shoe.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean, I'm sure there's other people who care, who care more.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And, you know, no offense side for listening.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I mean, just to, just so I can understand this.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So someone says, there's a, do you mind just walking through it?

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How the work?

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So there's a meeting.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's a meeting.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The high level thinkers at wired magazines get together.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And they come up with something smart that they want to cover.

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You know, cover.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like in this case, radio.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay.

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, radio.

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's the, yeah.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And, you know, some secret that we will not disclose stories or assign to various

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
people that are all about the, you know, the sort of mutations that radios going through.

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now that technology is changing.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Right.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We were talking about before, right?

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Challenges to radio.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
From, you know, new technologies and radio really hasn't gone through that.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And, and so then, you know.

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So for XM, that's kind of, that's kind of what that is.

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, I mean, that's out, that's out there's so far.

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And there's actually now, there's a program that some guys invented, which allows you to record XM.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And then enable it and, you know, store it.

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

179
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sort of.

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But where do you store it?

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
In the car or at home or.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You store it on your media player on whatever, whatever, you know,

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Your audio player is.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah.

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't mean to say media player like the windows.

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, I know.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Generic.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you.

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Thank you for, yes.

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you for clarifying.

194
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's important.

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please do not use the window media player.

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why not?

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's evil.

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No.

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
DRM.

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And Microsoft in general has some, I think, poor policies regarding its media player.

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But we could talk about that later.

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But yes.

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So this is for a big radio article.

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, it's about, so there will be articles about radio.

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I'm doing the article in podcasting and featuring Adam Curry.

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
See, this is the part that really I loved.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The Prince of podcast.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The Prince of podcast.

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You heard that.

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't tell me you've heard that.

213
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The Prince of podcast.

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Did you hear the song?

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I haven't heard you encouraging people to create the song.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I haven't heard any Adam Curry for like two days.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I mean, except in person, which is, you know, which is, of course, as much better than.

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But it's different, you know, when somebody is in person.

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You know, it's weird to like hear somebody on their podcast and meet them in person.

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You keep wanting to like not look at them and just hear their voice.

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And it's like not so distracting.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's like a person attached to the voice that's really in my iPod.

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah.

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So what are you doing?

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, what I was doing is actually I was going to see.

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have my iPod here and I put my eye trip on because we're in the A8 studio.

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Right.

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What I was going to do is I was going to play something over the sound system here.

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So we can record it through the microphones at the same time.

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know, you can also hear it because you're not wearing headphones.

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And I don't have a, it's not a real studio.

233
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No.

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know.

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't even know.

236
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I like the fact that there's a map of Gilford on his little.

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Isn't that the shit though?

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Isn't that the shit though?

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It also has little icons for where you can check this out.

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Check this out.

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That red sun looking.

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Shit.

243
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't know.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What is that?

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Is that a places you can go to get tattoo door?

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And we should check that out.

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, watch this.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Watch this.

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Because this is a DVD navigation system.

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So watch me zoom out.

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And you'll see.

253
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Does it show like planet earth?

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wow.

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I can go to any place within this map, which is all of Europe.

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wow.

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go to, let's go Berlin.

258
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

260
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hold on.

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's go.

262
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go to Berlin.

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So country.

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Right.

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We'll select Germany.

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Town.

267
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is being loaded.

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a big ass country.

269
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's not that big anymore.

270
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, for a whole bunch of towns.

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hold on.

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But we could go to an obscure German town.

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hold on.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, Berlin.

275
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Berlin.

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Berlin.

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
In multiple languages.

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Berlin.

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What is Berlin here?

281
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a little Berlin.

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a Berlin in Dutch spelling.

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I want to go to special destination or just a street.

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's go special destination.

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Maybe we can find out what that is.

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah.

288
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's a little sun.

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's a little sun.

290
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a landmark.

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How about an ice skating rink?

292
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Fine.

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Ice skating rink of Berlin.

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't understand why the ice skating rinks aren't also landmarks.

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, not necessarily.

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There might be, could be a landmark.

297
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Here.

298
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Ice, ice, portala.

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Do we go there?

300
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ice, portala?

301
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

302
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We even got the phone number.

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We now set a destination.

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Start route guidance.

305
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
When it starts us with the globe.

306
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I just want you to know right now.

307
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We're seeing a slow zoom.

308
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay.

309
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There it is.

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There's our route.

311
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If we leave now.

312
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We will be there at 330 this morning.

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Great.

314
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Well, all the way.

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We have to go underneath.

316
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We have to take the train.

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All the way from Gilford to the ice rink in Berlin.

318
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

319
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We could be that at 330.

320
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If we left right now.

321
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's great.

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, that's the power of technology.

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Isn't that wonderful?

324
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And it also has the traffic monitor system.

325
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So what the traffic is going to be like?

326
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, what it'll do actually.

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It'll route you around bad traffic.

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Wow.

329
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah.

330
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And they can shoot.

331
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now, what I was going to do.

333
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I was looking for the Prince of Pod.

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't believe that you haven't heard that.

335
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You haven't heard enough.

336
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I know clearly.

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
My ears are not.

338
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have not.

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hold on a second.

340
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You see how easy it is to fill up 10 minutes of.

341
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Of of MP3 space.

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We just did 10 minutes.

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know.

344
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Just looking at maps.

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's easy.

346
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And people eat to shut up.

347
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, let me see if I can find Prince of Pod.

348
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's true.

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean, I was willing to listen to like 20 minutes of you not being able to launch Skype.

350
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
With Lee.

351
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
With Lee Wilkins.

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Lee.

353
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you there?

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, dude.

355
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, man.

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It was just like hanging out with my friends.

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We were like.

358
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, no.

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, no.

360
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, no.

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, almost.

362
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, no.

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, no.

364
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, no.

365
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, no.

366
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh, no.

367
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Hold on.

368
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's the BBC traffic report cutting.

369
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey, Jenny.

370
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're all.

371
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
On the internet.

372
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In that cool.

373
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Someone has a traffic report.

374
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It cuts in.

375
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It just keeps letting you know.

376
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Here at the ice rate.

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There's a little bit of traffic.

378
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay.

379
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I seriously want to play a song for you, though.

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I seriously.

381
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

382
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hold on.

383
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
See how much I hate this iPod interface.

384
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Now, how long it's taken me to find something.

385
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He's doing that thing where you like spin your finger around the dial.

386
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's using his thumb, though.

387
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
A lot of.

388
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You do it with your finger.

389
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The index finger method.

390
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Really?

391
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The thumb.

392
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't have the thumb method is.

393
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You know.

394
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's.

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's interesting.

396
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The thumb.

397
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, the thumb method is the only.

398
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I only know the thumb method.

399
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You got to learn the finger method.

400
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's.

401
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think it's faster.

402
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But it's.

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It also requires two hands.

404
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So.

405
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

406
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So I'm going to.

407
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He's testing the finger method.

408
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

409
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The finger method sucks.

410
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay.

411
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I want to play some with severe spitties.

412
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Excellent.

413
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now, you've heard of him, right?

414
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have.

415
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Have you actually seen him live?

416
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I haven't.

417
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, I just heard him on your podcast.

418
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And I was like.

419
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay.

420
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll do.

421
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll play.

422
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You do have to meet him.

423
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
In fact.

424
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, let me.

425
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll have to pull this up for a second.

426
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, this is.

427
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What's setting up?

428
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, it's.

429
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The listivious bitties are performing.

430
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm such a mess.

431
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Are performing Sunday night in Manhattan.

432
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Of course, there's not the email I was looking for.

433
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I want to put that in later.

434
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I guess.

435
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This is me taking a drink of water.

436
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Go for it.

437
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Do I have.

438
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
See, Leanna sent me.

439
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Leanna from a severe spitties.

440
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It sent me email.

441
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There's so many different email accounts.

442
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay.

443
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll post about this in the in the production show notes.

444
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But essentially they're doing a show on the.

445
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
14th.

446
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So that's Sunday.

447
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sunday Monday.

448
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, today is the 10th 11th 12th.

449
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's Monday.

450
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then I guess.

451
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well, in Manhattan at 11 o'clock, no cover.

452
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And if you use the secret word.

453
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, which we have to come up with.

454
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Then you get in free at the door.

455
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So of course, it would be.

456
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What's a good word?

457
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What's a good secret word that people just want to say podcast.

458
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So that too.

459
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
podcast is good podcast or source code or.

460
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

461
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Or you could do like something that was, you know, more self-promotional.

462
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like I love Adam Curry.

463
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, no, no, no.

464
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because that would be wrong.

465
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Um, no, I'm just still trying to figure out where her email went.

466
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I had it saved obviously.

467
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll find it.

468
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now, it should be.

469
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Just podcast.

470
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, I think podcast works, right?

471
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay.

472
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, it's broken.

473
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay, podcast.

474
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you meant, and I'm going to give you all the details.

475
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Uh, what we'll do is we're going to play some list of these

476
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Bitties.

477
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And let me see if this is working.

478
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, I think it is.

479
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes.

480
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Okay.

481
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Um, I'm going to play famous.

482
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's one of my favorite Bitties songs.

483
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So we have to kind of be quiet what place.

484
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then otherwise you'll, they'll hear us.

485
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

486
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But it'll be cool.

487
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Here's the CBS Bitties.

488
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I have to find the right spot, so it doesn't crackle.

489
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want to be famous.

490
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I want to wear minks and sattens and pearls.

491
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I want to be famous.

492
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
More than just any old girl.

493
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to have eyes as blue as the sea.

494
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I want all the people to look at me.

495
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I want my own show on TV.

496
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I want to be that girl.

497
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I want to be famous.

498
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Eat out at sardies.

499
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I parties at spy.

500
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I want to be famous.

501
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Got to Paris on private flights.

502
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I want to have lovers buy the score.

503
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Movie producers knocking down my door.

504
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is the faith that is in store for me.

505
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh, when I'm famous, I will wear a great trench coat and fake red hair.

506
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So that all will know that it is me.

507
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

508
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

509
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

510
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

511
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

512
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

513
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

514
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

515
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

516
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

517
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:46,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,160
When they see me, how they'll smile.

520
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
When they see me, how they'll smile.

521
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,000
When they see me, how they'll smile.

522
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
At the point of the day I start to get laughing.

523
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It was like there's a team and when they have all the fashion, sort of like old times.

524
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, I like that, I love that.

525
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, I know, I love that.

526
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They give her a buddy, a little bit.

527
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah.

528
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Kind of like lounge singer.

529
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

531
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I think he played in circles this time.

532
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, I'm sure.

533
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

534
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

535
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm planning to keep that up.

536
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But he knows.

537
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, I will be a Barbie doll with huge fake tits.

538
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No hips at all.

539
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And I hate us attitude.

540
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

541
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Every morning I'll get high on.

542
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Colored Hills, Martini's dry.

543
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A little way and just good touch.

544
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, oh, oh.

545
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I want to be my famous better than all of my friends.

546
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, much better than all of her.

547
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I want to be famous, lonely and unknown at the end.

548
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, I'll end up bitter and ugly and old.

549
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Not just my body, but also my soul.

550
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But a legend is my goal and a legend of me.

551
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
When I'm famous, not a will give for the little people.

552
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, they have tears when I'm famous.

553
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey, my friend.

554
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Welcome to Adam Curry's Jazz Cafe.

555
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Everybody.

556
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
All right.

557
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That was the serious bitties.

558
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I want to be famous.

559
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You can check them out at bittiesforever.com.

560
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And I found the email.

561
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So it's Tuesday.

562
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's a, I even got me information wrong.

563
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's Tuesday.

564
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There's a no cover show in Manhattan at 11 p.m.

565
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's the bitties holiday party in Manhattan at the living room.

566
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Any idea where that is?

567
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's 154 Ludlow Street.

568
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And there's even an, I'll put this in the podcast show notes.

569
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
2125337235.

570
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
One set 11 p.m.

571
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And here's the deal.

572
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The end suggests you could give your listening audience a secret code.

573
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So they can come up to me or the production manager Ben.

574
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Say the code.

575
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And they will know how many people came.

576
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Thanks to the podcast.

577
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Maybe she's just during the, during the set.

578
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Just say anyone here from the source code.

579
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Raise your hand without talking.

580
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

581
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There's another way to go.

582
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
My be better.

583
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But also the, the secret word is pod squad.

584
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's what it has to be.

585
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Pod squad.

586
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Pod squad.

587
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Pod people.

588
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Pod people.

589
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

590
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Like we're going to come up.

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Similarly you.

592
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh, no.

593
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But anyway, definitely go check out.

594
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's a no cover.

595
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So go check out the, the bitis, the, the listivious bitis at the bitis holiday party in Manhattan at the living room.

596
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Tuesday to some of 14th 11 p.m.

597
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
154 Ludlow Street.

598
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I think great thing about these podcasts is you can basically use the thumb or finger method to replay that message and find out exactly where it is.

599
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Still here with with Analy who's come to lovely gilford.

600
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Uh, to talk about pod casting and did you get enough about me and you think you know enough about my life?

601
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I feel like I do.

602
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah.

603
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You didn't have any of the sex questions I expected.

604
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There was none of that.

605
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

606
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I mean we could do the sex questions now.

607
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

608
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

609
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So I'm waiting for you to interview me some more actually.

610
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I think that'll be really cool.

611
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, you know, how was sex with Michael Jackson?

612
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You know, when I met Michael Jackson was the weirdest thing the first time I met him because we

613
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
met him.

614
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is when I had to give him the Michael Jackson video Vanguard award, which was created only for Michael Jackson, so he would.

615
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He could only be given to him by you precisely.

616
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

617
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You know the story.

618
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And the reason why the sex part.

619
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I had those sex with Michael Jackson.

620
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What's the point?

621
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But here's what was weird.

622
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So this was at MJJ Studios in Los Angeles.

623
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's not in some weird back-ass road to.

624
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Beautiful studios, right?

625
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So you walk in there.

626
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And what was weird was immediately.

627
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I saw that they were at least 10 kids running around.

628
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And how he Mandel was there.

629
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Which is.

630
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Which is weird.

631
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I mean, well, thank you.

632
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't know.

633
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's like, you know, maybe.

634
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Was he pulling a glove over his head?

635
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well, no.

636
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Maybe the how he Mandel was supposed to like keep the kids busy with it.

637
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And with his body's world voices or something.

638
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

639
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're doing a lot of the body's voice.

640
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It was scary.

641
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was scary.

642
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know, adults in Michael's life.

643
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
At that point, we didn't know about any of the allegations.

644
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah.

645
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I still don't know if it's true.

646
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I mean, I have to say a lot of the evidence or what is being called evidence points that way.

647
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But that's hard.

648
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I have no idea.

649
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Did they just read his house again?

650
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah.

651
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He's fucked.

652
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

653
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He really is fucked.

654
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He's fucked.

655
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And you know that Tommy Matolle, you know, Tommy Matolle is right?

656
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No.

657
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Tommy Matolle.

658
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Tommy Matolle.

659
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He runs Sony Records.

660
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh, OK.

661
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And he was married to Mariah Carey.

662
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Right?

663
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There's a whole story all by itself.

664
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Tommy Matolle hates or at least when I was in New York and in the scene hated Michael Jackson.

665
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And Michael Jackson is so insecure and so childish really.

666
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That all these promotions to do when this was the bad album.

667
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Literally, of course.

668
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This was the bad album.

669
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And so the head Michael in the in the limo and they're going from, you know, from station to promotion or whatever.

670
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And Michael kept saying, I really have to go to the bathroom.

671
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And Tommy Matolle would not let him fucking pee.

672
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's so awesome.

673
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
On purpose.

674
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
On purpose.

675
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Not to can't do it.

676
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Can't go pee here and not.

677
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We've not let him take a piss.

678
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He hated him so much.

679
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Just be in this cup.

680
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Really?

681
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't know what happened.

682
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I think he held it until he was back in the hotel.

683
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But that was horrible.

684
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
No, Michael Jackson.

685
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Very sad case.

686
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I think.

687
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Very sad.

688
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Could let's be honest.

689
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Boy can sing.

690
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Boy can dance.

691
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Very, very musical.

692
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Very musical.

693
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But he has turned into a zombie.

694
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
More people than me have said that.

695
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But yeah.

696
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't know if that's just what you see.

697
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is the thing.

698
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This podcast is real honest.

699
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And there's nothing.

700
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
People can tell who we are and they're hearing us.

701
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And there's nothing in between this microphone and everyone else's ears.

702
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But you don't know what you're getting from Michael Jackson.

703
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What's real or what's not real?

704
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
A two second sound bite on TV.

705
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But you can tell that he's a zombie from the two seconds.

706
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I mean, you know, he's the one.

707
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I want to say yes.

708
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I want to say yes.

709
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But I have a feeling that some of that is also accentuated by the way it's edited.

710
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I don't know.

711
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Even the stuff that he edits him, that he's, you know, he's in control of editing.

712
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You think that he's not.

713
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't know.

714
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't know.

715
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He's a zombie on the stuff that he had that he had control of.

716
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I thought it was actually pretty good the stuff that he had.

717
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, I guess so.

718
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But you see that he's trying to control it.

719
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's what was irritating about that.

720
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Even that documentary that he made.

721
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Did you see that?

722
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No, no.

723
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What was the documentary?

724
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, there was two documentaries that the everything came to

725
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
ahead with this English guy who did a documentary.

726
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That was like a tell all experts.

727
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes.

728
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But at the same time, he Michael Jackson has own cameras rolling and you saw

729
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
the other side, which totally exposed the English documentary to be set up,

730
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
kind of, you know, edited to make him look funky.

731
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But what at the same time gave away is how controlling he was trying to be over

732
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
his own destiny and the way he was having his stuff edited.

733
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Wow.

734
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So with Michael's view and sensationalist view.

735
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah.

736
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah.

737
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah.

738
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay.

739
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So I didn't have sex with Michael Jackson.

740
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We've established that.

741
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I've actually not had sex with any famous people accept my wife.

742
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I've come close.

743
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So what was the closest you got to star-fucking?

744
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Mandy Smith.

745
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You remember her?

746
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I vaguely remember Mandy Smith.

747
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Mandy Smith was the Lolita 16 year old that Bill Wyman married.

748
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Mm-hmm.

749
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Then Bill, the Rolling Stones.

750
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Mm-hmm.

751
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And it was a big to do because he essentially had sex with her when she was like

752
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
14.

753
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But they got married when she was 16.

754
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And then she had a song a record out.

755
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Mm-hmm.

756
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And she came to the Netherlands to promote that.

757
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Well, I was doing TV and she was totally coming on to me.

758
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Totally.

759
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Totally.

760
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Totally.

761
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Now at the time being, I had a client-designed relationship with Patricia.

762
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It was very famous in Europe.

763
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Mm-hmm.

764
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And she was married.

765
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So we came up with this great plan.

766
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Because she's really nice.

767
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And Mandy Smith, the time very sweet girl.

768
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So you had a chance to be the star-fucking two women at the same?

769
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

770
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Not at the same time, but during the same time period.

771
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yes, but it was different.

772
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because Mandy and I had real no real interest in each other.

773
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But we had the same problem.

774
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
She was being stalked by paparazzi, et cetera.

775
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because she had this relationship with Bill Lyman,

776
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
which wasn't really known at the time.

777
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But she was going out with Bill.

778
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She wasn't married to him yet.

779
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It was like six months later.

780
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And I had this whole thing with Patricia, which was supposed to be not known.

781
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So what did we do?

782
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I invited her come over to Amsterdam and we went out together.

783
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And then everyone was talking about us.

784
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It was the verdict.

785
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And then of course there was this point where we said, well, we just have sex.

786
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This is where we're faking it anyway.

787
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's like man, never mind.

788
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, no.

789
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Because now she loved Bill when I love Patricia.

790
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It was like, but that was about the closest.

791
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So do you think that that means that like the Tom Cruise Penelope,

792
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Cruise thing deaf?

793
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Tom is totally gay.

794
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Come on, the gay.

795
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Who is it?

796
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We're totally not having sex at all.

797
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I have no idea.

798
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can be gay and have sex with women.

799
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, sure, sure.

800
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But I mean, your story kind of is shattering.

801
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
My illusions about the fact that, you know, he's probably, because I was sort of enjoying

802
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
imagining Tom Cruise, you know, having to force himself to have sex with him.

803
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
To have sex with him.

804
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Just to have his punishment for him for staying in the closet.

805
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You know, it's like, you will be forced.

806
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I gotta tell you though, that must be so hard to live your life like that.

807
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah, I can't even imagine.

808
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Because George Michael is just come out, right?

809
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Really, this is...

810
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He's now going and he's doing a tour for promotional tour for his new album.

811
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah.

812
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And he's been on the BBC several times.

813
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You know, just going through this whole thing.

814
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And he said at one point, he said, I have to do the English accent.

815
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Otherwise, doesn't work.

816
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, my God.

817
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I couldn't believe it.

818
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It was like, here I was.

819
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I was the number one pop star on the world.

820
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And I was a fucking poof.

821
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And he was freaked out about it.

822
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You know, because he was mainly huge in America.

823
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And he was like, he was really freaked.

824
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And he couldn't let he couldn't be himself.

825
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And I remember, I couldn't even get an interview with him.

826
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He was so freaked out about life and everything in general.

827
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He couldn't deal with it.

828
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He still can't deal with being famous, really.

829
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He just wants to be a writer and a singer and a producer and all that.

830
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And a poof.

831
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And a poof.

832
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And he's a major poof.

833
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And he's very good at it.

834
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But I think...

835
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But more importantly, Rob Helfer came out.

836
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I mean, that's like way more important.

837
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But that was such a...

838
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
For some reason, and for those of you don't know, Rob Helfer

839
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to Judas Priest, he came out several years ago.

840
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And he had like a new band, a new new, like...

841
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Like almost as well.

842
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Like almost as well, man.

843
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But no one really cared.

844
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Did he lose...

845
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean...

846
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Really?

847
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Did you...

848
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Did you lose interest in the band?

849
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I was happy.

850
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But I had always admired them.

851
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
As a youth, my first concert with...

852
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Was you depressed for real?

853
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah, for real.

854
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It was so cool.

855
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And I learned the whole thing about, like, holding it

856
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
if you're lighter to light.

857
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like that.

858
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah.

859
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That was my first experience.

860
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Excellent.

861
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I was like, oh, and all that time, he was a homo.

862
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's so awesome.

863
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We didn't know.

864
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We didn't know.

865
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We didn't know.

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We didn't know.

867
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Boys, you can be a tough metalhead and be queen.

868
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And actually, if you play the records backwards,

869
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it does say...

870
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

871
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
At all the time.

872
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No.

873
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It wasn't saying worship Satan.

874
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It was saying...

875
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You know, the bitties actually have a piece of back masking.

876
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I found that I was listening to the album.

877
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It was true, they really do.

878
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That what I haven't played it backwards yet.

879
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But you don't really.

880
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
No, but they have a piece that's backwards on the album.

881
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm going to check it out.

882
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
There's a back masking piece.

883
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It probably is just literally a piece backwards.

884
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
That is probably nothing more than that.

885
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But you're right.

886
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's it.

887
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So anyway, so yeah, Tom Cruise.

888
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah, Tom Cruise.

889
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Tom Cruise.

890
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
How'd we get on the whole homo thing?

891
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't remember.

892
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It was...

893
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Something about sex.

894
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And it was you not having sex.

895
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Right, not having sex.

896
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That person who is your beard, even though it was a heterosexual beard.

897
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
There was a heterosexual beard.

898
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh my god.

899
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And it's fun because all those years at MTV,

900
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you'd think...

901
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Because we were very separate from the offices.

902
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Officers were at 175 Broadway before that 1775.

903
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And we were down.

904
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We actually had the studio right next door to the Sally Jesse Raphael Show.

905
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So in the morning, I would tape my segments.

906
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And then during lunch, I'd have to stay in my dressing room

907
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
because all these degenerates, you know, like,

908
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
midgets having sex with, you know,

909
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
you know, whatever.

910
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's all kinds of stuff.

911
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's just having sex with their mothers.

912
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah, right.

913
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We're walking down the hallway.

914
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And it was...

915
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It was...

916
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It was a traffic report.

917
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah.

918
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That was a traffic report from the BBC.

919
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But never.

920
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Never.

921
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Did I see...

922
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
See, or was I offered anything other than maybe a token

923
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
to join?

924
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Never saw any coke.

925
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, I've never even done cocaine.

926
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
No.

927
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Nothing.

928
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
All that rock and roll, you know,

929
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
stuff that may have oozed from MTV screen.

930
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Not true.

931
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It was horrible.

932
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It really was just getting high and not having sex.

933
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No, but they were...

934
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Well, just...

935
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No.

936
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
People weren't even really smoking pot.

937
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It was me and Rick, the audio guy.

938
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You were...

939
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We were the pot fans.

940
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

941
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No, the camera guys were not...

942
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No.

943
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No.

944
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
No.

945
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Rick.

946
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Rick's my boy.

947
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
He'll always be my boy.

948
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It was so good.

949
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We would share my dressing room and these audio booths.

950
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So, you know, whenever he had to take a dump,

951
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
he'd literally come to my dressing room and sit there and read my fan mail.

952
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, I was doing the audio.

953
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And we wouldn't tell anyone.

954
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's a good...

955
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's a good way to, you know, hang out.

956
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, I also learned a lot about audio.

957
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Like, through the bathroom door, like he'd be taking a dump.

958
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And he'd be like, dude.

959
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, no, because no, because I'd watch him.

960
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
How we would do the audio stuff.

961
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah.

962
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He'd say, oh man, it's time for my dump.

963
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Okay, Rick.

964
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Well, you know, he had these bags.

965
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
A number of postcards before email.

966
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Just get postcards and naked pictures.

967
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So, I had huge postal bags full.

968
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And, you know, just...

969
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Whenever he had time, he opened like 20 of them.

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
He had no time to open all of them and read it.

971
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And so, Rick went to help me scan the mail while he was using my bathroom.

972
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And that'd be tracking...

973
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'd be opening the mics and starting the tapes and everything in the audio booth.

974
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And the directors didn't know about it.

975
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
They'd just say, you know, alright, track 97A.

976
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I just opened up the track and I would start up the music.

977
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And then sometimes I'd fuck up and be like, Rick, are you high again?

978
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And I'm like, mmmm.

979
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They didn't know it was me running the audio board.

980
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And the good old days of this scene.

981
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The good old day.

982
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Dude, we've been at it for 31 minutes.

983
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think we should stop.

984
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So I can put in 10 minutes of opening and closing things.

985
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah.

986
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I think that's a good idea.

987
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I think that's a good idea.

988
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And I think that's a good idea.

989
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And I think that's a good idea.

990
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
What I would love is if you...

991
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You should do your own podcast.

992
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You're perfect.

993
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I know.

994
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
If you want to see my work, you can go to my website.

995
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah.

996
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Textploitation.com.

997
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Textploitation.

998
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Textploitation.

999
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
T-E-C-H-S.

1000
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And then theploitation part.

1001
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You can work as well.

1002
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But it's not, you know, with an X.

1003
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So, yeah, I mean, I don't know about doing the podcasting thing.

1004
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll think about it.

1005
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I like being on your podcast.

1006
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well, you can be on my podcast anytime you want.

1007
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You got Skype?

1008
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I have Skype, yeah.

1009
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We can try getting that working for 20 minutes on my next podcast.

1010
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
See what crap we can go through.

1011
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I really appreciate you taking the time to come down and talk about, you know, whatever.

1012
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah.

1013
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It was worth the jet lag.

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah, I was going to say, could you?

1015
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What did you get in yesterday?

1016
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Got in yesterday.

1017
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So that was my jet lag day.

1018
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Because I saw you with, I saw one yon.

1019
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That was...

1020
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm totally recovered.

1021
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I forced myself to stay awake all day.

1022
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Right.

1023
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So that I would be totally set.

1024
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So that way I can go tomorrow back to the day.

1025
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You're going back tomorrow?

1026
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

1027
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Okay.

1028
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So the budget's not that big.

1029
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It wired.

1030
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You don't get anything else in London?

1031
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
No, no.

1032
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I could have stayed if I wanted to.

1033
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But I need to get back.

1034
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Because, you know, my sweetie's having a performance on Saturday night.

1035
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Really?

1036
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I want to be there and, you know, support her and, you know,

1037
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What does she solo or play in a band?

1038
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So she runs a show called Writers With Drinks in San Francisco,

1039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
which is a spoken word variety show.

1040
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And she's the NFC and there's going to be a lot of great writers.

1041
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Tim Stanley Robinson is going to...

1042
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Hello, podcast.

1043
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I know.

1044
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Okay.

1045
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Saturday night.

1046
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay.

1047
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
At the makeout room in San Francisco.

1048
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
730.

1049
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Tim Stanley Robinson, an awesome science fiction writer.

1050
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He's going to read.

1051
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There's going to be a bunch of other awesome readers.

1052
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And come on.

1053
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's like three bucks to get in.

1054
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Can we...

1055
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I mean, this is the kind of stuff.

1056
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We put a link to it on your brain.

1057
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We should record this.

1058
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We should record it.

1060
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Fuck.

1061
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This is your podcast.

1062
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah.

1063
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Here's your drinks.

1064
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
No, seriously.

1065
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah, totally.

1066
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Love that shit.

1067
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That would be great.

1068
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I mean...

1069
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm going to tell Charlie.

1070
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know what the, you know,

1071
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
how would, you know, what people think about them being recorded and being podcast,

1072
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
but shit.

1073
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
What a tremendous opportunity to get this stuff out.

1074
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah, really.

1075
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's really good.

1076
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We've had a lot of fun with this.

1077
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I love spoken word type stuff.

1078
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You too.

1079
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Have you heard the spoken word revolution?

1080
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's an audio book.

1081
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'll send you a link.

1082
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Cool.

1083
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I can't.

1084
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I can't.

1085
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I can't.

1086
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So I could digital restriction management.

1087
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Exactly.

1088
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Now, but that's the kind of stuff that we need more of.

1089
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, we do.

1090
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I mean, the thing with podcasting is it's just in its infancy.

1091
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more stuff like that.

1092
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like independent artists doing spoken word.

1093
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You know, people bringing you news from underground communities that you don't normally hear from.

1094
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And that's what I think is really great.

1095
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And people broadcasting from their cars.

1096
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Hey, man.

1097
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And look at this gear.

1098
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I should take a picture of this.

1099
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't have a Pimp in mind.

1100
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
My car is pimp.

1101
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't need anyone to pimp it anymore.

1102
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He's got a studio in here.

1103
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, it's pretty great.

1104
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And the BBC in constant traffic updates.

1105
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
All right.

1106
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So you need me to take you back to the station?

1107
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah.

1108
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, that'd be great.

1109
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay.

1110
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I know what we'll do.

1111
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Of course I can.

1112
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You just bear with me because you know, I'm still learning this left hand.

1113
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Side of the road.

1114
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You've got the new Pimp and ride has to have the steering wheel on the right hand side.

1115
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I think.

1116
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
After the leases.

1117
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh.

1118
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You don't do this by yourself.

1119
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
No.

1120
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Do not do this at home, kid.

1121
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Do not mod your car.

1122
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
All right.

1123
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It could result in severe penalties somewhere down the line.

1124
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

1125
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think it's in the Ula.

1126
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
All right, Emily.

1127
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Thank you very much for hanging out.

1128
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Thanks very much.

1129
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Come on back to source code anytime you can.

1130
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Thank you.
