1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Well, good morning everybody!

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Welcome to the Daily Source Code, I'm Adam Curry, coming to you from Flanders, Belgium

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
from Curry Castle and this is the place where users and developers party together and I

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,500
apologize for not putting up the source code for yesterday.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Actually, I'll tell you what the plan was.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Since Dave Wein and I were going to do a trade secrets during the presidential debate,

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
I figured by the time I got home, as you might know yesterday was a big day for me.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I had a discussion with a company that wants to audiobooks or wants to distribute that

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
through podcasting.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Lots of really exciting stuff happening, but I didn't get home until reasonably late.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,500
In fact, Patricia was also coming back from Amsterdam, she had to go to the dentist.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we both kind of were returning to the castle in different automobiles at different times.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so we both decided, well, you eat at some restaurant there on the way home.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I'll eat at this restaurant here because we were on two incompatible highways.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And so we got home.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And then I just kind of discovered after having done more calculations with time zones that

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
if I wanted to watch the debate with Dave simultaneously and record it,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'd have to get up at about 2.30.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And by the time I realized this, it was like, I don't know, 11.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I didn't have time to really put a source code together.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I apologize because now I can see on the iPod.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Users and developers both confuse,

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
hey, I didn't get the DailyStore's code yesterday.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And there's something else that I wanted to mention,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
something that I've noticed.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The way I have it set up, the way I use

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
MarsEdit with RadioUserLand,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I just post stuff through MarsEdit,

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
but if I want to put an enclosure in,

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have to go in through the web browser interface

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to RadioUserLand to go manually put in the

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
enclosure URL,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
since I haven't really,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I've put together some publishing scripts in the past,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but wasn't happy with them,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
so I'm still kind of doing everything manually

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
until I know exactly what I want to do

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and what I want the settings to be

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and the ID3 tags,

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so we're getting pretty close on a lot of that stuff.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Shoot, what was my point?

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Oh my God, I'm lost on my own soliloquy.

43
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Anyway, forget all that.

44
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:44,500
So I did get up at 230 and connected with Dave and we did watch the debate together and we

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
did comment on it.

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
And I have to say, technologically, this was a tremendous success.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Although we didn't get the streaming part set up, we actually, I reached out to Doug

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Kay of IT Conversations at the very last minute and said, you know, hey, we're

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,500
thinking we could take some calls through Skype and X10 and whatever else.

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
And maybe you could stream it.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
And Doug, unfortunately, had already gone off to a conference and he had always

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
gear with him, so he couldn't help us out.

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,500
But it's probably, you know, well, I don't know, if we had been streaming it

54
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
live, it might have actually been pretty interesting if we'd been able to

55
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,500
get people on in the conversation with us.

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
But, you know, it's like halfway through the recording, we said, you know, I

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
don't know if I was going to give a shit about this.

58
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Certainly no one who saw the debate.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
debate is going to care. And actually stuff that we discussed right after the debate,

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
which was, I don't know, it probably wasn't even for public consumption. That was a much

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
better conversation. So we just said, you know what, scrap this. We're going to try

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and do a wrap up tomorrow.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
of things. And now of course we have to figure out nine hours time difference again so we

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
can hook up properly. But the technology of the debate, as I want to say, that was really

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
good because we finally figured out how to make the X10 SIP phone sound a bit reasonable,

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
found some automatic gain settings to limit Dave's microphone so when he talked too

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
loud it would crack and break up. Oh no I want to say about the RSS feed when I

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
update the show. So depending on, let's say that it's about just by coincidence,

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I've posted this and I still have to go back and add the enclosure URL into

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the post that basically puts this show into my RSS feed. Let's say I do it two

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
minutes before the top of the hour. So first it goes through the motions.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Probably by the time I've gone into the web interface to add the enclosure

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
posted the RSS feed without the enclosure.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now I think that what's happening is that some aggregators, and maybe some of the iPodder

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
stuff does this, will grab the RSS file and will certainly won't wait, won't download

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
anything until it's been updated, which will probably be in an hour later or something.

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,500
You know have their iPod are set for twice a day so yeah then then you're not gonna you know you're not gonna catch the you're not gonna get the show.

78
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,500
So I'm gonna try and publish simultaneously because I also have a feeling that maybe some of these feeds are.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And people are just missing out.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So it's something we just got to be aware of.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Same goes for trade secrets.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If I post the show, then I can post a link to it, but Dave has to manually put in the

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
enclosure URL.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So that's stuff that we got to fix, but it is actually affecting the network.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Our broadcast network is affected somewhat by this.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, forgot to say thank god it's Friday.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's going to be pretty, you know, slow day for me here.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I just catching up on some stuff here at the castle.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then tonight at eight o'clock, Patricia and I are off to Jolio Blighty.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We're going to fly to London City.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And from there, we're going to drive to our future home.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And we're going to spend the weekend measuring, you know,

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
kicking the trees, kicking the tires, looking around the neighborhood.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Christina's going to stay with her grandparents.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And oh, and by the way, we'll be alone.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So don't expect me to do any podcasting over the weekend.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, I'll be podcasting, podcasting something else.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Anyway, I'm going to play a song for you to kind of get into the mood for this Friday.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
As I was watching the debate last night, I thought to myself, you know,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
all this conversation about Iraq and the war in Iraq.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And if you look in the Stevie Wonder's Villa, Get It Gela,

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
a ghetto village ghetto.

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,500
land then if you live there you probably wonder dude it doesn't matter who's

104
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:03,500
president I might have to go it's a JPL remix of Stevie Wonder's below get it

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
land I really it's a little bit long it's about six minutes if you want to

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
skip through it but

107
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:20,500
I'm going to go with you, I'm not getting free.

108
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Would you like to come with me?

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Let me guess.

110
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,500
These are people not strong

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
While I've heard that they're here

112
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,500
They're like a man in their hills

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
They're dying

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:20,500
God cover the hand of the Lamb.

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The end of the season, so I'm gonna go to the farm and see if I can make a move.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It is not a good idea, but I'm gonna go to the farm and see if I can make a move.

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, I'm gonna go to the farm and see if I can make a move.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
national up

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
all of him

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
if

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
then

122
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
God's people

123
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
And I

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Now some folks say that

125
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Jesus is

126
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
For what we have

127
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Some folks say that we'll be happy

128
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
If the make-up's safe, the drill depends off the lighting

129
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Just dust it off, hit the ramstacks

130
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Supercup in the hall, bring the cats that be hating

131
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Till we love the dog, they know this is the dog's law

132
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
It's coming for war

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Watch what you let when I start busting my fucking head

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's the right place to be

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Even on a walk

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I bet the whole town hustling

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yo, I'm riding this block

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Starving at night, coughing at tea

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Parming the block, I'm bigger with niggas

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I watch you the wild

141
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I hold my breath and I pull the pipe

142
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Get the shit up twice, shit is my life

143
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's me with a 45, I'm dead

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And through the red day, give me the bank

145
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Or give me your face, give me a shank

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's holiday

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
remix of Village Ghetto.

148
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Friday, October 1st, 2004.

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you want to hear more of that, more JPL remixes, more cool remixes, there's a real

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
remix scene here in the Netherlands.

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can check it out at mixfreaks.org.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay, I'm going to go through the mail bag because I got a lot of responses to the previous

153
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
show, a couple of things I need to share with you.

154
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
First of all, my daughter, Christina, this is interesting.

155
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
She's been using a Manila site since, oh God, since, man, I'd have to look at her website,

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but it's been for several years.

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's Christina.manilasites.com.

158
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And there's also, she has a domain name that defaults to that, which is the land of the

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
young and the hopeless.com, which is, that's a song by her favorite band Good Charlotte.

160
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Basically, what she has is a Good Charlotte, that's a band, a Good Charlotte weblog.

161
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And she's a pretty big fan.

162
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And she was poking around and she said, you know, dad, I'd really like a new...

163
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:11,500
skin on my weblog and of course in the manila and radio world we call skins themes.

164
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,500
And I found one and she found a Brian Bell theme, Collins-Sake.

165
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Was it Collins-Sake is the theme?

166
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
And she said, well, you know, can you install that?

167
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And I said, oh, and initially I said, sure I can install that, but then I thought,

168
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
wait a minute, she's not on one of my servers, she's on the manila site server.

169
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
And I said, well, really, you know, that's not being supported anymore,

170
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
or it's up and it's being supported, but I don't think they're doing any more support.

171
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
So you probably have to move it over to one of my servers and she's like, yeah,

172
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
but I'll lose the manila sites.com domain name and all this stuff.

173
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Okay, here's the plea to anyone who's at userland who's listening.

174
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,500
If you want to do me a solid, if you could install that theme on manilasites.com, that

175
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
would be greatly appreciated.

176
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,500
If not, then I'll have to convince Christina that it's time to move domains.

177
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,500
I met at the first BloggerCon, so that was two BloggerCon's ago, if you count the

178
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
upcoming one November 6th.

179
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I met Gregory Blake and his weblog is at, let me see,

180
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,500
ezunes.com, so it's www.ezoness.com.

181
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
And nice guy.

182
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,500
We had dinner together with a whole bunch of people after the BloggerCon.

183
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,500
We went into a chatting and we've exchanged email once in a while.

184
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
And I was hoping that this would happen.

185
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,500
And I even emailed Gregory and said, ah, you're the angel I've been waiting for.

186
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Gregory says.

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've been checking out iPodder, using it, really liking it, but realized that really the organization

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
of the information on iPodder.org just doesn't give me enough.

189
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think Gregory is very much a user.

190
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He might be more of a developer than I know, but it doesn't really matter.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And he's offered to be the curator of all things iPodder on iPodder.org, and I could

192
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
not be happier because I'm just swamped in the information.

193
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I really need someone to sift through it and do that for us.

194
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So I'm going to set up some stuff for Gregory and then hopefully, well, not this weekend

195
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because I'll be busy in the UK, but Monday he'll be able to get started.

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And we can start cleaning some of that stuff up, pointing to the right applications, the

197
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
right spots, because we have at least three Windows clients for iPodder coming out in

198
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
the next couple of days, a couple of which are already available working and it's just

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
like down.

200
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
to install and GUI stuff, which is the most important thing,

201
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
is how does it look?

202
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
I've seen some screenshots.

203
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Andrew, Bromina's working on it.

204
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
There's of course that wonderful plugin for

205
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
oh, what is it?

206
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Show me, gosh, I can't even remember now.

207
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Show me what's on.

208
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Oh, there's a link to it from iPodder.org

209
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
but they also do iPodder functionality.

210
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
That's working.

211
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
It's embedded in a different application.

212
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
But, well, there you go, even I'm confused.

213
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
So Gregory is gonna start helping us out

214
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
and I could not be happier.

215
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,500
And remember I was complaining about my mac.com email

216
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
and also not just the email but also my iDisk.

217
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
So I've kind of reached, I find this,

218
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
finally was an email that came out from the

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
comes with 250 megabytes of Mac dot Mac mail and iDisk storage but to thank you for your

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
for your patronage we're going to increase your total storage to one gigabyte for the duration

221
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
of your membership and so this is what kind of pissed me off so clearly they were upgrading all

222
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
these accounts and that screwed screwed stuff up because I could see it I could see my iDisk

223
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
saying you have no space available when I knew that I had plenty of space available so a

224
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
they didn't notify us that they were doing this they did it during the day of

225
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
course you know wherever you in the world it's going to be during the day sometime

226
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but it seems like they did it during the the United States day which is probably

227
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
not too smart and and and it's not like email didn't wasn't arriving in my

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
account it was bouncing was actually being returned to people you know saying

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
sorry we can't reach this this guy's mailbox is full which it's embarrassing

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
really I got a lot of people laughing at me saying I used to you dick you know

231
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,500
which is it's a very geekish thing and sticks and stones etc.

232
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
But still, you know, they embarrassed me as a customer.

233
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,500
On top of that, I had just purchased an additional 100 megabytes of disk storage

234
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
because I saw the errors. I'm like, well I only have 200 messages.

235
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I don't think it's filled up, but anyway I'll buy another 100 megs.

236
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,500
And I also bought the 1 gigabyte disk storage to put up some of these shows

237
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500
to even out some of the bandwidth and also quite honestly to see how it worked

238
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
and for testing purposes.

239
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,500
And I paid for it and I'm sure somewhere in their system

240
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
they're going to refund me that now that I basically

241
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not like I have two gigabytes all of a sudden waiting for me.

242
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I can work all of that out with them, but man, for them to announce on their site saying,

243
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
oh, we upgraded and a few people had some mail issues.

244
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Well, if it was only a few people, could you please send those few people an email and

245
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
say we're sorry?

246
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's all I wanted.

247
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm still going to use your service, but this pisses me off.

248
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Just I'm a customer.

249
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm paying you real money.

250
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Please.

251
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And now I'm going to suck all your bandwidth by putting all my shit on my

252
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
podcast on my I-disc.

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
See what we run into there.

254
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
See, got a request from Anthony for more Durewood douche.

255
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I already played a song today.

256
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll play Durewood douche on the next.

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I do have an whole album.

258
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Remember that was the song everybody's fucking but me.

259
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Let me see.

260
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, yes.

261
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The stomach bouncer bit that I played on the last source code.

262
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500
podcast. This also comes from Anthony, says the comedian telling the joke was Jim Brewer.

263
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
He used to be on Saturday Night Live, currently he's touring the States with his own show.

264
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
So there you go. Very good show, clearly. What else did we have? I have a couple of

265
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,500
comments I need to go through here. Oh yeah. Well, thanks everybody for responding to

266
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
my Mac problems. I told you my Mac was sick. By the way, the swan did die and it

267
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:09,500
was sad and we did have to put our dog down. That was also all yesterday.

268
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,500
That wasn't fun. Oh, there's my wife. Yes, dear.

269
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Okay.

270
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
I already had some cereal.

271
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
That's Patricia saying, you're fucking podcasting.

272
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
You have to eat before you do this stuff.

273
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I did.

274
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I did.

275
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,500
So I told you about Mac was really sick and it was really, it was on the ropes and the

276
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,500
finder was doing funky stuff and the doc was doing funky stuff and it seemed like it

277
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
was really, you know, crunching along on numbers.

278
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
And I tried everything that you could imagine from repairing disk permissions to cleaning

279
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,500
out caches and setting up PRAM and desktop rebuilding.

280
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I've been doing that for 15 years with Macs.

281
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,500
And then a couple of people said, you know, basically what you got to do is you

282
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
just got to reinstall your system software.

283
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
And I, that's not what I wanted to hear.

284
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I was like, oh, please.

285
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
But I bit the bullet since I was in Amsterdam anyway.

286
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
And actually, I don't have to say it was a very pleasurable experience.

287
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,500
I thought it was really going to suck because typically when you do something

288
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
with your system, all your preferences are hosed and, you know, applications disappear

289
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
and connections that you've made.

290
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
with stuff doesn't work.

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So with OS X, I just followed the instructions,

292
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
just put in the booted from the startup, from the install CD.

293
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It noticed that I had OS X on it.

294
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It said, look, you do want to keep all your system folder

295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and reinstall a fresh copy.

296
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We're going to rename that system folder to previous system.

297
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You'll have all your stuff still there.

298
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And although the one little tricky bit

299
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is it also then wants to install another.

300
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,500
iChat, iCal, and iTunes and I deselected those because I knew that I already had up-to-date versions

301
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Not only that I purchased the iLife 04 package so I didn't want garage band or anything being messed up

302
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,500
So I just deselected those did the install it went through the whole thing

303
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Beautifully rebooted came up

304
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,500
My desktop looked exactly the same that the computer seemed completely responsive that you know that fan wasn't spinning disk was calm

305
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,500
And then of course had to download about a hundred and fifty megabytes of system updates

306
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Which it does all put it's not like you get you know 18 different security packages

307
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Just one big macOS update and then you get a couple more

308
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Along the way so that takes another probably about another hour of everything to download and install and it was great

309
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
the only thing that I've had to

310
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Reinstall was the soundflower sound drivers because those do sit actually in your system folder everything else was I mean all the

311
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Scripts I have running

312
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
everything

313
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
works. And I've kept the previous system folder which is about 4 gigs of God knows what.

314
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Just in case I need something, but so far it's... no, I'm extremely happy everything's working

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and yeah, knock on wood for Murphy there.

316
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So thank you very much for advising that and I certainly advise anyone who's using a

317
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Mac if it really starts to act up and it's getting kind of crappy, you can easily do

318
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
this system reinstall. It won't kill you.

319
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
See I got an update from Martin Fenroy, that's on the iPodder Windows.

320
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Actually this is iPodder for Windows and Mac and Linux.

321
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What do we have on Win32? This is just some stuff that's coming up.

322
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
System tray icon with different states, nice interfaces cross...

323
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
everyone's working on this stuff. I mean, I have 40 messages on the iPod or dev list

324
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that I haven't even read yet. This is absolutely phenomenal. And I also said, the other day

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
we were talking about Python as I was talking about how...

326
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,500
And I thought that Python was a Dutch invention and indeed Eric De Jong was sent me a mail

327
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:10,500
and he says Python was conceived at the Free University of Amsterdam by a Dutch guy who's

328
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
been living in the States for a couple of years by now.

329
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
So that's cool.

330
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I didn't know that.

331
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Well, I did kind of know it, but it was nice to have the confirmation.

332
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
It's something to be proud of.

333
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Yes, dear.

334
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Oh.

335
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Huh?

336
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Yeah, you're walking into my studio.

337
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,500
So then you have to tell me what you're doing here.

338
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Your telephone.

339
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Okay.

340
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I had the goats.

341
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
You're going to the goats?

342
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Okay, and the chickens.

343
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,500
And you need your phone when you go to the goats and the chickens?

344
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Yeah.

345
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
You're never going to have to go to my meetings.

346
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,500
On that note, everybody, let me see.

347
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I had something else queued up for you here that I wanted to play for you.

348
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Oh, yeah.

349
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Bumper.

350
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Morgan, that name may not ring a bell, but you'll remember Dr. Day from Las Vegas and

351
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Bumper Morgan.

352
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's not his name I know because he's another big time radio guy from way back.

353
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And I think I've met him at like some river fest in Nashville when I was hawking my syndicated

354
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
countdown show.

355
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And he said, hey Adam, how you doing?

356
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Heard you a bit about MP3s and it turns out that Bumper, a while back, I love this

357
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
name, Bumper Morgan everybody.

358
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Bumper had put together a bit about the history of MP3s and he sent me a link to it and I'm

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
going to play that for you.

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Now it's about, let me see, it's got interviews in here.

361
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It's, I haven't really...

362
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I didn't want to listen to the whole thing first so it's going to be kind of a surprise.

363
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It really sucks I'll cut it off but from what I heard the first couple of minutes it sounded

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
like it was going to be really interesting.

365
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So it's part of promotion for Bumper but it's also a history of MP3s from a Radio Guys

366
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
perspective which of course is always fun to listen to and it's also good because

367
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
there's a lot of what we're doing with this podcasting.

368
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay so let's hit this and I'll talk to you in about 8 minutes.

369
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
This is the history of MP3 from Bumper Morgan.

370
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
In 1994, there's been a revolution going on in the radio industry.

371
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Radio stations can receive their product at net speed with bumper production.

372
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So revolution!

373
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,500
for the consumer. It just means a great way to store great large amounts of audio on a very small

374
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,500
amount of space. You can put 100 songs on a CD and that's a wonderful thing.

375
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Bob Ellison from Centrillion Software, the makers of Cool Edit Pro.

376
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
We've got new products coming out like the Rio from Diamond Multimedia,

377
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,500
kind of like a Walkman with MP3 on it. And to the audio professional for high-end audio

378
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,500
production, MP3 means that you can trade audio at a very high quality across the internet.

379
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
This is something that really wasn't possible before because audio takes up so much room.

380
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
And so the quality level and the compression that we've achieved has made a great difference.

381
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,500
And of course in radio, the big difference is being able to trade actual broadcast quality

382
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,500
samples right across the internet over email, over the web, and the other methods that we're also

383
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,500
used to today on the internet. Research for MP3 really began in the late 1970s with a group of

384
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
at the University of Erlangen in Germany.

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It has taken a long time, I think, to arrive at the level of MP3, what we have today.

386
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I think it was a collaboration of really a team.

387
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We started back at the end of the 70s,

388
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and I made a research proposal to a research organization

389
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
to transmit audio via telephone lines

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
with the ISDN 64 kilobit per second data rate.

391
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But this was considered at that time to be impossible.

392
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I even had the idea together with a colleague to file a patent.

393
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But the guy at the patent office refused to file it as a patent

394
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because he again said that it's impossible according to the state of the knowledge.

395
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And then I asked a young PhD student,

396
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,500
student at that time, this was Karlheinz Brandenburg, who is now the world-leading expert in that

397
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
area.

398
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I asked him to make a simulation on his computer about 64 kilobit per second music audio coding.

399
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
This was the star.

400
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:56,500
He tried it and after four weeks we could listen to some seconds of coded audio and

401
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
the quality was not.

402
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Isn't that interesting that some guy at the patent office refused to take the patent for MP3 because he said it's just not

403
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Whoever that guy is, give him a medal.

404
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:20,500
And from there we started to really work seriously on it and we started with what at that time

405
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:27,500
was called transform coding, which essentially was to bring the signal from the time domain

406
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:38,500
in the frequency domain. And then we immediately had the idea to imitate the properties of the human ear,

407
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:52,500
the human sense of listening, and to omit those parts of the signal which could not be heard by

408
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,500
by the listener, by the human ear. And this I think this was what was called at that time

409
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
irrelevant. And irrelevant is just a part of the message which the receiver

410
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:24,000
cannot receive and cannot hear in the case of the ear or if any other receiver cannot perceive at all.

411
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I think this was very good to do in the frequency domain because we had the sensitivity curve of the ear

412
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and with this sensitivity curve we could determine the amount of information, the number of data,

413
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
the number of bits we needed in each critical band, which the acoustic people they know what critical bands are.

414
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And then we had a clear understanding how many bits we would need and we started to measure with real music this data.

415
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And at the same time we were working in the field of electronics and we were very strong in developing not only in relation techniques

416
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
but signal processing and we started to build bits like this.

417
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Then we saw that with symbol algorithm for the frequency transform, we could do it in real

418
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
time.

419
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
As soon as we had this, this was in 87.

420
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Then MPEG started.

421
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:33,500
We made a demonstration to the MPEG group under the another Kiraleone.

422
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,500
The people were enthusiastic about what we had achieved.

423
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Then we went on.

424
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:49,500
There was a European research project, what was called BAB, Digital Audio Broadcasting.

425
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:58,500
In this project, we developed I think the concept of perceptual coding.

426
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:07,500
In the meantime, also, Hans Brandenburg, he had been with the Bell laboratories and talking

427
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
gentleman whose name is Johnson. I think he's all famous in perceptual coding. And so we developed

428
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:29,000
step by step through the level that is represented by MP3 today, which is a step by step refinement

429
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
of the original techniques.

430
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
From there, the Fraunhofer Institute in Munich, licenses the MPEG codex.

431
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We started with the Fraunhofer Institute in 1985.

432
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
This was the foundation of the Fraunhofer Institute because before we did it at the university only.

433
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And the Fraunhofer Institute did start it with the real-time implementation.

434
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And it was their first contribution to do it in real-time.

435
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It was done in 1987 where other people did the simulation

436
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and could present about 10 to 20 seconds of music which they had done simulations on for hours.

437
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And we were able to do it in real-time.

438
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And I think this was a big breakthrough because then you could demonstrate to everybody, you know,

439
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and you could go to evaluations and present it and everybody could bring his CD along with him.

440
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,500
and they will play it through so I can listen to your...

441
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And I think this was really the breakthrough

442
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that we could do it in real time.

443
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And they are convinced of people,

444
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and you could do a lot of experiments

445
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
with a lot of different pieces of music,

446
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and you were able to convince the people.

447
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Then, tell those systems into the fray

448
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
with their new real-time product.

449
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The Zephyr was the first commercial product

450
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
to incorporate MP3.

451
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And ever since it came out in 1994,

452
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
broadcasters have been really impressed

453
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
with both its audio quality and its convenience.

454
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Kevin Tam of Colo's System.

455
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It really makes the remote sound like...

456
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And more often than they care to think, the Zephyr has filled in as a backup to other transmissions.

457
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's also caught on for use by voiceover talent and also for mix approval.

458
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
The power of MP3 is really awesome.

459
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And just like analog tapes, when you make too many doves of MP3 files, your product will suffer from generation loss.

460
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well, one of the things to remember about MP3 is that it is a lossy format.

461
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Lossy means that when you encode to that format, you lose a little bit of fidelity of the audio.

462
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And MP3 is so good because you don't lose the pieces of the audio that are most important to making it sound just as good as it was in the original.

463
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But it is a keep in mind because when you're encoding to MP3, let's say you take a file and you encode it, and then you decode it, and you encode it again,

464
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and then you decode it to wave again, and you encode it again.

465
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
With each iteration of this encoding process and decoding process, you lose more of the fidelity of the audio.

466
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And all that means is that we have to think of MP3 as a target format, a sort of a one-way street ideally, and use...

467
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
This is ENCODE 2 MP3 when you're done with your audio and you know you were ready to submit

468
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,500
it for broadcast or archive it or what have you.

469
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
The time has come.

470
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
to downloadable promos and buffers at the speed of net.

471
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
So, roll-o-sh!

472
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The most excellent bumper Morgan. Thank you very much for that history. I had no idea

473
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So now we know that mp3 was is a fine German invention and that if some lonely guy at at the patent office

474
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I've zoomed in Germany if he hadn't said I do live on assist me

475
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm going to be a patient application

476
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Come back another day

477
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
They weren't for that we might have been bogged down with tremendous boy wouldn't have and we probably wouldn't have mp3

478
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You know wouldn't be able to use it

479
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So thank you very much to that guy. That was fun listening to that actually

480
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And I didn't know well conceptually I guess I figured if you keep re-recording mp3s then eventually you get degradation

481
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Haven't noticed too much of that although if this mp3 is an example because this did come from an mp3

482
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, then it's true because that's not pretty

483
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,500
up. But usually when I play first run stuff from someone else's podcast, it sounds pretty

484
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,500
good depending on the encoding. That may also have to do with... Well, I don't know because

485
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,500
I am setting this digitally through my sound system. I have no idea. I have no idea. So

486
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,500
obviously there's going to be degradation, something we've got to keep an eye on if

487
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
we're doing too much overdubbing.

488
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Now, let me see. I have two... Well, we're at 37 minutes. I missed the show yesterday,

489
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,500
so I guess we can go a little bit long. There's two things I wanted to do. I have a

490
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,500
bit of an audio book I wanted to let you hear. I've finally gotten around to

491
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,500
listening to Snow Crash, a Snow Crash written by Neil Stevenson. Now, I've read

492
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
this book in the early, early 90s, so I'm going to say that it's probably from

493
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,500
the late 80s. And listening to it, of course, brings back the book. It was

494
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,500
a pretty significant book. At one point, I even registered Metaverse.com,

495
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
with Neil Stevenson's approval as long as I didn't put it on T-shirts and coffee mugs.

496
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,500
And unfortunately, that went in with the sale of my company.

497
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
company that was a part of the assets.

498
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Damn.

499
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I still would have liked to have Adam at Mediverse.com.

500
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We even had machines.

501
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If you've read the book, we had a machine.

502
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:48,500
pretty into it. When we started the company, it was Carl Jacobs who turned me on to that.

503
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,500
He used to work for Sun. Carl and his brother Chris, they were out in San Francisco hacking

504
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:00,500
away at the black Sun machine for the metaverse. Good days. In fact, I remember pushing audio

505
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:07,500
through at the time when we had just gotten the 96K modem and through the PC, the PC

506
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,500
M codec, I was able to receive audio coming from San Francisco through the

507
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Sun machine over the internet. At the time I had a regular 56K dial-up modem,

508
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,500
US robotics, I think. Those were the days. Anyway, so Snow Crash, really in its, as

509
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
with all science fiction, it's always fun to look back and say, okay, so how much

510
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
really came to me.

511
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And I guess when this book was written, Cable was a big deal.

512
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Cable came up in the 80s of course.

513
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
That's what I have a lot of my fame and fortune to thank for, is MTV being in over 40 million

514
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
households.

515
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And in the book, and it's too complicated to get into everything, but there's a cable

516
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
television mogul.

517
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And I'm just going to play a little bit of him.

518
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And by the way, this book isn't just one reader.

519
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It's multiple voices.

520
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's some sound effects in there.

521
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's just really well done.

522
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But to hear these words that were written way before we were really thinking about

523
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
any of this, before really the commercial internet happened, which at the time,

524
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
yeah, I mean it was the World Wide Web was just, yeah, we just had the mosaic

525
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
browser when I read the book.

526
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So it came out before then.

527
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The foresight really of what monopolists were going to do with communications,

528
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
telecommunications, and technology is already all.

529
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,500
over this book. Now hopefully I've bookmarked it appropriately. You can do that with the

530
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:52,500
AAC format. And this should be the piece of him, of the cable television mogul who has

531
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,500
a Texas twang of him talking about, well just shooting the breeze. So this is from

532
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Snow Crash. The unabridged version is from part one. In total it's about 17 hours

533
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:10,500
of audio. Very well read. Very good quality. And I think totally enthralling from

534
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
beginning to end.

535
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Okay, that should have started.

536
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:22,500
El Bob Reif, Lord of Bandwidth, is sitting behind his desk having his mustache waxed.

537
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Not in the sense that women have their legs waxed.

538
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,500
He's having the curls smoothed out and restored.

539
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,500
The waxer is a very short Asian woman who does it so delicately that it doesn't even

540
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,500
interfere with his talking, mostly about his efforts to extend his cable TV network throughout

541
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Korea and into China, and link it up with his big fiber optic trunk line that runs across

542
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Siberia and over the Urals.

543
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Yeah, you know, a monopolist's work is never done.

544
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,500
No such thing as a perfect monopoly.

545
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Seems like you can never get that last one-tenth of one percent.

546
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Isn't the government still strong in Korea?

547
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,500
You must have more trouble with regulations there.

548
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
El Bob Reif laughs.

549
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:12,500
You know, watching government regulators trying to keep up with the world is my favorite sport.

550
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Remember when they busted up Ma Bell?

551
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Just barely. The reporters are women in her 20s.

552
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You know what it was, right? Voice communications monopoly.

553
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Right. They were in the same business as me. The information business.

554
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Moving phone conversations around on little tiny copper wires one at a time.

555
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Government busted them up. At the same time when I was starting cable TV franchises in 30 states.

556
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Can you believe that? It's like if they figured out a way to regulate horses at the same time the Model T and the airplane were being introduced.

557
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And a cable TV system isn't the same as a phone system.

558
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
At that stage it wasn't.

559
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Because it was just a local system.

560
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But once you get local systems all over the world, all you gotta do is hook them together

561
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and it's a global network.

562
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Just as big as the phone system.

563
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Except this one carries information 10,000 times faster.

564
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It carries images, sound, data, you name it.

565
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So eventually of course we know what happened is we got the internet and Neil Stevenson at all.

566
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
goggles and you walk around in it.

567
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Great book.

568
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,500
I really recommend it if you are going on vacation on a really long drive and you won't

569
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
regret it.

570
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
You do have to stop at certain points.

571
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,500
It just gets so intense and the visuals that are being created is like, oh, I don't know,

572
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
that's technically possible.

573
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
But yeah, totally, totally good book.

574
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,500
I bought it at audible.com, but I'm sure you can get it just about anywhere.

575
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Okay.

576
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
One more bit then.

577
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
I've been through the blog digger media feed.

578
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,500
There's been lots of mixes of, and I kind of like listening to most of them, of soundbites,

579
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,500
presidential debates, stuff like that.

580
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
And so people are kind of creating their own story with the tools that we're all using

581
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
today, just desktop tools.

582
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:21,500
This isn't really one of the best ones and you'll have to decide for yourself.

583
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
It's only about a minute and a half.

584
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,500
But it's out there and if I don't play it now, it won't make much sense playing

585
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
it later on after the election.

586
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
So here's, and of course, I don't know who it's from.

587
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It only says Norrell Preff or N-O-Rell Preff maybe.

588
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's titled Liars and Murderers.

589
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I don't like your name.

590
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The government are um, Liars and Murderers.

591
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I don't like your name.

592
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The government are um, Liars and Murderers.

593
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I despise your masculinity.

594
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Put yourself in your whole fucking plan.

595
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Liars and Murderers.

596
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:11,000
We will bring the Iraqi people food and medicines and supplies and freedom.

597
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
Something for her to play little games.

598
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Players.

599
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
We're both part of the same hypocrisy.

600
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And so were we.

601
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,000
In this honest way you pose yourself and try to pass yourselves off as decent Americans.

602
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The Taliban regime in Afghanistan had given Osama bin Laden a base.

603
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Khat bin Laden and the Taliban leader were never caught.

604
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Instead more than 3,000 innocent people were involved to death.

605
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Some people have to play little games.

606
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Players.

607
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
America's war on terror is about hypocrisy and double standards.

608
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
They don't want the voice of reason spoken folks because otherwise we'd be free.

609
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Otherwise we wouldn't believe their fucking horseshit lies or the fucking propaganda machine

610
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
being streamed in by their horseshit products that we don't fucking need

611
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and become a third world consumer fucking plantation which is what we're becoming.

612
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Fuck them.

613
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
They're liars and murderers.

614
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
All governments are liars and murderers.

615
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't like your kind people.

616
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Whoa.

617
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So I get a lot of email people saying, you know, why do you play this stuff?

618
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Do you agree with everything?

619
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
We'll say, and no, of course not, not with everything.

620
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,500
I think some of the words are pretty harsh.

621
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Some of them are right on the money.

622
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,500
But this is art, you know, whether it's mixing stuff together

623
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
or painting something, you know, throwing oil on a canvas.

624
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
It's art.

625
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,500
And I think that as long as we're doing this podcast,

626
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
it might as expose as much of it as possible.

627
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
All right, I'm going to leave it at that for today's source

628
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,500
code.

629
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
What do we do?

630
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
We did 46 minutes.

631
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Perfect.

632
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I hope you just finished your.

633
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,500
And I will see you on the next source code which will likely be right after the weekend.

634
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And this was the show, the Daily Source Code for today, which was Friday, October 1st,

635
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
2004, as always.

636
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And of course for all the archives in the latest show, it's DailySourceCo.com or...

637
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And that is at DailySourceCo.com.

638
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I hope you enjoyed it.

639
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'll talk to you soon.

640
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Bye bye.
