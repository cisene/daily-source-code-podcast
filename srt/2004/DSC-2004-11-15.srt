1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
podcasting, all's live, and a curry.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The power of the door is in the door.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, hey everybody.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
After actually a good late morning from Curry Castle.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As right as you did, a source code for Monday.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We are living in November.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It is the 15th day of the month of 2004.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Live from Curry Castle.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The power of the door is in the door.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Or maybe we should say almost live because of course it's not my recording.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Wow.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I had time to assemble all kinds of stuff for the show over the weekend.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have a list of this incredibly long.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So many of the audio comments.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean, we've been dropping stuff that I absolutely wanted to get on the show today.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But it's just too long.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think we're going to be close to an hour.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I wanted to go through some stuff.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's going to be a little bit wagging today because as we speak, the movers are here.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They are packing up our stuff.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a multiple day operation.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They already were in Amsterdam last week.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As you recall, packing up some of the stuff there.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I basically told them, look, he just stay away from the bar for the next hour or so.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So at least I can get this podcast done.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But I'm sure people will be eating out asking all kinds of questions.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Patricia's upstairs.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Christina's here in the bar.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, it's just a couple more days.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't want to give all the details because I know the Dutch.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know the Dutch press is certainly listening to the daily source code.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't want to give many ideas about when to go stand at airports.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And shit like that because just don't need that, honestly.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But yeah, as I said, it's definitely a multi-day operation.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a lot of fun.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And even when we're gone, the piano will still be here,

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
be waiting to pick up, it's just, it's kind of nuts.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So a lot to talk about today.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And there's also, well, just to start off with Christina,

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm glad you're here.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Remember you had the day off on Thursday and didn't remember what it was?

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, vape is still strong.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But it's armistice day.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's what it is.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I got an email here from Rob.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Actually, a comment here from Rob.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He says, Adam surprised that someone living in flangers would not know something about armistice day.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The end of World War I.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When Germany surrendered to the Allies at 11 o'clock on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So it was the 11th of.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, yeah, he can be a little smart nose,

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
because he knows what the hell he's talking about.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So we learned something.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I could not believe the amount of comments that I've received about my iPod or ear problem.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now, I'm not talking to you anymore, Christina.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You don't have to.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hold on, there's the phone shoot.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What should we do?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, it's my banker.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll put it on hold for one second.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll be right back.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Right, okay.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm glad I took that call.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You know, I'm trying to open up bank accounts and do all this kind of stuff.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Get everything ready for, well, for us living there, for us being there.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And it's just not easy, you know.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And without a bank account, by the way, without a UK bank account,

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you can't get essential things like cable and internet,

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
internet and, you know, cell phones and all this stuff.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So anyway, I was talking about iPod or ears.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
iPod or ears is kind of like tennis elbow or mouse arm or I had mouse finger,

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which I think someone sent in a comment about.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Talk about that later.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But basically, from having these little ear buds in the whole time,

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and I've had headphones on my entire life, both radio and flying,

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and actually they're the same headsets in many cases.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I've never really had the little ear buds in for extended periods of time.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And check out this email.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've gotten a lot.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
See Andrew Chernau says, he has the same problem.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He says, maybe you should invest in the pair of headsets.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Headphones if you want to go into longer recordings.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's suggesting, what is he suggesting?

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sony.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I guess that is true.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have a pair of Sony headsets around here.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know what he's really?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I like being able to monitor what people are going to hear.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I figure that if people are listening on these ear buds,

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of course, lots of you may be using an eye trip or something

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to broadcast FM signal to your car radio.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But still, I want to try and have as much of the same experiences

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the listener is going to have.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I don't know if headphones is really going to work for me.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
RenÃ©.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's see.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, RenÃ© talked.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, heard me talk about my finger mouse issue.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I've got the Bluetooth mouse.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And could I please provide make and model?

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, it'd be happy to.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because I actually like in that quite a lot.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let me see.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's in here in my bag.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I hold on.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And that works.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Actually, that works quite well.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's like now my headphone wire isn't long enough to reach.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we go.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is by Mac mice.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I guess Mac mice.com.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The mouse BT Bluetooth.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's what it's called.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It just looks like a regular white Mac mouse.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So Mac mice.com is where you can check it out.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So it's designed in Tennessee, USA.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then really small letters.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It says manufactured in Taiwan.

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Doesn't matter.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It'd be working.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So that goes back in the bag.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And what's the next one?

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is all.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Again, we're continuing here with the.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I potter ear.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Here we have.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A podcast ear is what James.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ah, this is James the invincible.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Of course.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
James is Donna Drew's buddy.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's see.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, what did he say?

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He was listening.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, he said I.

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So he's actually suggesting a model of Sony.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's see.

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I went through a bunch of other stuff.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Awesome set of Sony ear buds.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It was the MDR ED21 LP.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Although they seem to be deprecated.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So maybe they're out.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But this is James.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And he must know about ears.

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is the guy with a huge shotgun hole piercings.

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And he's earlobe.

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So he's got to be an ear guy.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So we'll check that out.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Of course, the production notes of the daily source code are going to be online available

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
with the posts that went out today.

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So I'm actually posting James's the copy of all the emails in there.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you can read back whatever the serial number was.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And the answer more to say about the promiscuous bullet guys.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But you'll read that one.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You check it out when you check as it even out from the production notes.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Final one here for the headphones suggestion Stewart Hunter.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He says he's using the Sony MDR W08 headphones.

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Very lightweight.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They sit slightly inside the ear rather than being stuffed right in like an earbud.

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now that may be a solution.

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He provides a couple of.

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, okay.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Richard sounds in the UK are selling them.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So I can actually buy them in the in the UK after the move.

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
All right.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, thank you very much for the for the comments there.

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Again, those will be in the production notes for anyone who is also interested in getting something else

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
than the then iPod or ear from ear buds, finding some solutions to that.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And also something that happened over the weekend.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You may have seen me post about it on my weblog.

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
All of a sudden my battery for the power book just died.

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And now of course it's not just all of a sudden right.

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
These things don't just happen.

178
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I believe there was a system update.

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And if I look online, you know, if you just type in the Google Powerbook 17 inch dead battery,

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you're going to see all kinds of issues.

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And it's really not clear if Apple's batteries have problems.

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've never seen a battery go that quick just from apparently okay to zero.

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In fact, it doesn't even recognize the batteries in anymore.

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There's no lights on the battery when you post little test indicator.

185
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So the first thing was a real bitch to figure out how to restart the power book with a dead battery.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And you have to go through this power management unit reset sequence,

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
which basically means you hold down shift control, alt, and then you hit the power button.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let go weight five seconds, then power up as normal.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It'll reset your clock and everything, but it will start up, which is kind of what was the most important part.

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So somehow I've now got to figure out where to get a power book battery.

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Because here's the scenario I see that I'm running into.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We're going to move.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I won't have a battery, which means I'll be tethered to power.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Won't have any type of broadband in the house just a dial-up line.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course, I don't think that the Wi-Fi of the city will reach to my house.

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I'll have to drive into town.

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Of course, I have to sit in the car because I'll have a battery to sit anywhere with the power book.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, you know, or I find an apple store.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's just, or maybe today I'll drive up north somewhere and find an apple store and get it all going.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's see.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Got an email here from Tony from Oz.

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Tony says, where are I?

203
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, I'm good day.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Adam, we're going to call Center Christ.

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I won't put my last name in because I'll probably get sacked for that.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe I should take this out of the email here right now.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going to take that out since we're going to be publishing these notes.

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There you go.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Your name is now safe with me.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I love your podcast.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They are raw, man.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They are like getting stone with your mates and listening to shit.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You normally wouldn't listen to.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, dude, that's exactly what...

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's exactly what's happening here.

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He says, I spend probably 10 hours outside every weekend in the yard.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hey, it's Australia.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Non-rugby league season, of course.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Man, your cast breeze me through the weekend.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you very much.

222
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maybe you can pop the question.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He's the the question.

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A member of the coalition of the willing.

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
When apple iTunes might immigrate to Australia.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, that's a good question.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
By the way, he says, is immigrate is that the right word?

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know.

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Shoot.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I really hope that you get set up.

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I guess you can't...

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The European Union now has iTunes and iTunes's music store, I guess, is what you mean.

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hmm.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't know.

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I guess it's...

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What is it?

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I guess, yeah, I don't know.

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have no idea.

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's kind of sucks.

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The only alternative, I guess, would be to use an American credit card, or European credit card.

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay.

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So that's a market that still needs to open up.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hope it happens soon for you there, Tony.

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Now, I got so much to do today.

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm just going to breeze through as many of these things as I can.

248
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
A lot of stuff that came in over the weekend as the iPod,

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
was just churning away, particularly on blog digger media and

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
God knows, openpodcast.org, and I came across an interesting way of...

251
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Playing back your voicemail.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you get a voicemail, and this probably is some guy who broke up with his girlfriend.

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And she leaves you a real nasty voicemail.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You could do a couple things with it.

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You could play it for your friend, and you could listen to it.

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Or, of course, you could mix it all up and turn it into a podcast.

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hello.

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hello.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hello.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hello.

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think you're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hello.

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hello.

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hello.

265
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I think you're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This message is for kids.

267
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm Mr. Dana.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm Mr. Dana.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm just calling.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm Mr. Dana.

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And I'm just...

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I'm just calling.

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm Mr. Dana.

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm just calling because we're against the weekend.

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So you can play it over and over again.

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But it over and over again.

277
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But it over and over again.

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I think you're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I think you're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Over and over again.

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

282
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Over and over again.

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think you're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

284
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Especially the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I can't believe you.

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Then I can't believe you,

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,520
and I can't believe you.

288
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,360
I can't believe you ever thought you had any any any

289
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,660
any can't put me.

290
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,720
Hello, hello, hello,

291
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,880
I think you're the biggest fucking loser I've ever met in my life.

292
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Thank you, and thank you, and

293
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,360
and I can't believe you, thank you, and

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:47,720
thank you, and thank you, and thank you, and thank you, and

295
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,000
thank you, and goodbye.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Isn't that awesome?

297
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, thank you for your message.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
Tony Kong is, uh, this is slowly, uh, well,

299
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,880
certainly slowly, but surely, turning out to be our good friend,

300
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,080
my good friend from Boston.

301
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,360
WGBH, the first public radio,

302
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,840
broadcaster to hit the podcasting scene with morning stories,

303
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,640
and

304
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,000
met him out at BloggerCon, had a really good chat with him.

305
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,840
It's a very interesting guy, and he's been posting his morning stories,

306
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,320
which he produces for a WGBH in Boston.

307
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,880
He's been putting those up on podcasts, of course, you could find that for me.

308
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,880
I potted out org directory, and usually he starts off by saying,

309
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,320
you know, today's morning story is about, and then he kind of leads into it.

310
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,520
But for the, I think this is the first time we're actually hearing Tony,

311
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,160
and I'm not going to play the whole morning stories, because you, you know,

312
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,720
I want you to subscribe to that, and, and, you know,

313
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,760
get your morning stories the way you should be getting it from the feed.

314
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,560
It's also, it's, you know, these about four or five minute stories,

315
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,480
a lot to, a lot to play through if I want to get through the other stuff today.

316
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,360
But I think this is the first time that we're hearing Tony actually,

317
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,880
introduced, you know, his morning story's episode, and kind of,

318
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,760
well, you know what, he's podcasting for real.

319
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,880
Hi, this is Tony Con, the producer and the director of morning stories on WGBH Boston.

320
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,200
Just back from BloggerCon 3 in Palo Alto, which was an incredible event with ripples

321
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,160
that we'll be going on. I hope for a very long time.

322
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,400
I want to thank you all who came up just to say hi to say that you enjoyed morning stories,

323
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,320
and that meant an awful lot to us. We're going to keep on bringing them to you.

324
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,640
And also, who just checked in to say hi, and to make sure that we stay in touch as this

325
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,400
incredible revolution keeps on working itself out.

326
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Today's morning story is in celebration that we can stop that.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,400
That's the whole intro to the morning story. Patricia just, hey, hon.

328
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,200
Hi, man. I'm, uh, I figured I'd do my source code now, so that then after I'm done,

329
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,960
they can come in, they can rip everything apart between boxes, yes.

330
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,760
And an army of, uh, how many is like eight guys, eight guys, and six guys, six guys?

331
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,680
One handy man. Yeah. And, uh, it goes really fast.

332
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
It's no shit. I'm like, yeah, I'm like, yeah.

333
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,120
Because otherwise they peck your dog. Well, actually, that could be a benefit.

334
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,720
Can we just put her in a big box and, uh, shipper off? Okay, um,

335
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,320
do you need me to do anything? Because I'm just want to, I'm just going to finish the show and then, uh,

336
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,080
and then I'll help them pack up the bar. They need some money.

337
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,040
I need some money for all you have to get some, uh, a coffee and a whole amount of second.

338
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,960
It's next for them. Um, where do I put the money? Oh, yeah. I remember right there.

339
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,520
You need it now? Yeah, I'm going to shit. How much seen me?

340
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,000
Do you have, you, but you need money. You just need money, right, to walk around like money?

341
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,360
Okay.

342
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,400
Walk around and spend that somewhere else, but on, on ourselves.

343
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah, that's what moving's all about, everybody.

344
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:16,040
Okay. Um, oops, moving right along. Uh, we have another friend that we met at Blager Khan,

345
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,440
Jaime, and he has some news about his Spanish podcast.

346
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,880
Hi, Adam. This is Jaime. Um, well, I want to just give you the news.

347
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:36,360
I successfully recorded the fourth and final installment of my podcast in Spanish.

348
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:44,680
It broadcast must go into the story. And, uh, I've successfully completed these with

349
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:54,200
no additional costs using just the hardware that I had in hand and free software that I found

350
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:04,280
in the internet. I've explained, uh, every single step I took to record my podcasts and how to

351
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,760
publish them, how to write the external tags, et cetera. And they're available at

352
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Bapis.org forward slash podcast for anyone who speaks Spanish and wants to

353
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,240
wants to know how to do these. So, you know, it's like a couple of seconds from me to understand what

354
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,640
Jaime was saying, because I'm like, what? He stopped his podcast, but what he essentially did, I think

355
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,280
it he created instructions in Spanish on how to podcast. That's awesome, uh, and it really appreciated.

356
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,760
Although, Jaime, I think you should continue, man. Don't stop with a podcast. Damn, you know,

357
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,640
we finally had a Spanish podcast. Keep it going. That just would be my hope that you might do that.

358
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,680
And anyway, I can help you know, just let me know. Um, I noticed that you were basically

359
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,640
coding your RSS files by hand, which, uh, there are easier ways to do it. And, and if any of

360
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,280
any of those production reasons is what made you stop, you know, let me help you out, because uh,

361
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,280
I'd love to, you know, I'd love to put you in the pod squad, man. Let's, uh, let's keep the Spanish

362
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,960
vibe going. So, uh, anyway, if you're thinking of doing a Spanish podcast in iPod.org, under languages,

363
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,040
and under the Spanish, no, you'll find Jaime's podcasts, or I guess it's just how to, uh,

364
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:24,840
how to podcast in Spanish. Email from Tony Mullins, who's been listening to all kinds of podcasts

365
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,480
for the past three weeks. Now he says it doesn't own an iPod, but uses Doppler, uh, Doppler. I think

366
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:37,160
it's a plug-in for, or it has a podcast plug-in. I'm not sure. I know it's an aggregator. Um, he says,

367
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,760
uh, he's, you know, getting into it, wants to set up a podcast. He's got a band, check this out. Um,

368
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,960
a band called Big Toon. Uh, you can find BigToon at BigToon.org. Our latest CD is a couple of tracks

369
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,200
I'd love for you to check out. Possible play on your RIA three daily source code show. Um, what did

370
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,600
you score? It was a pattern of a team. Damn.

371
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,120
No, that would have been bad if they backed the retainer. So anyway, um, I appreciate it.

372
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,640
I appreciate, um, you sent me the link at Tony. Send a couple links to, uh, to some of his files.

373
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,040
They are 100% money says and 100% RIA three. And I kind of like this one. So,

374
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,840
put out. So, set Avenue. You're going to check it out here on the daily source code for Monday,

375
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:43,180
with the Fifteen K

376
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,840
One last break, to leave it as half

377
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Another one's gone, he's never around

378
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Sometimes things just work, it's turned itself upside down

379
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

380
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

381
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

382
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,840
We never

383
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Here's a playin' on their horse that they are

384
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,840
They don't have a chance to go there far

385
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,840
My mom's crying in her house, she's just outside

386
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,840
You want to help, but you don't know how

387
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Get to say, I'm the moon

388
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

389
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

390
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

391
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

392
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,840
There's a man I know from a little time

393
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,840
You never did wrong, and it's true you've grown

394
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
It's never for and it's true for true

395
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,840
That he walked down the streets and said, I'm the moon

396
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

397
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

398
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

399
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

400
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

401
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Yet you say, I'm the moon

402
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Big tone, for big tone dot org

403
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,840
It's a sad avenue on your daily source code

404
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,840
For Monday, November 15th, 2004

405
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I really appreciate all the comments and emails about the BBC stuff that we posted up on Friday

406
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I wasn't quite sure how people were going to respond to it

407
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,840
But I think the conversation that Dave and I had on Skype

408
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Was quite clear, and I'm sure the BBC have checked it out as well

409
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
I hope they understand

410
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,840
I think everyone understood that this was exactly the apex of

411
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Big old media and, you know, new small media

412
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Where the big media needs to do things a certain way

413
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
And there's certain expectations

414
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,840
And that's probably what people expect at home viewing as well

415
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,840
And I was happy that we were able to provide the exact opposite side of the equation

416
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,840
And I do believe that the culture show will have a

417
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Some form of, I think it's a real video stream available when it comes out

418
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
I think it's the 23rd of the 25th, they'll let me know

419
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
And I'll post that accordingly

420
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
And perhaps someone can record it while in the UK

421
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Perhaps by that time I'll actually have a television

422
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
And I'll be able to record myself myself

423
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Maybe she got one of those, maybe I'll get an I view

424
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Or some kind of PVR set up so I can make an MPG out of that myself

425
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
But it was kind of fun

426
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
And also, you know, Dave was doing the exact same thing

427
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
He's appearing in Newsweek

428
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Not quite sure what it's for

429
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Yeah, I don't think he's told anyone what it's for

430
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
Maybe he has, but I'm not sure if I can talk about it

431
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Doesn't matter, you'll see it

432
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
And it was the same thing we were laughing about that

433
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Because what did they want him?

434
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
You know, they want, you know, Mr.

435
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Granddaddy, Pintdaddy of web logs to be in a cyber cafe

436
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
You know, changing the world

437
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,840
And as Dave pointed out he was doing the exact thing that I was doing with the BBC

438
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Because he was posting pictures of the photographer

439
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Doing the shoot while he was actually there

440
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
You know, it was up online before this guy

441
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Even clicked off his first shot

442
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
So, you know, that really shows a whole

443
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
You know, world of difference between

444
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Old media and New media

445
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
If that's even a fair representation

446
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,840
But dude, we really need each other to bootstrap to the next level

447
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
So, hopefully that was all understood

448
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
And everyone enjoyed it including

449
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
A good friends at the BBC

450
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Moving along with a couple of bits

451
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,840
We got some promos

452
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
And you know what?

453
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
He's consented to Miss Walker Khan

454
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,840
This is the rest of the web audio

455
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,840
4, 2, 4, 11, 12

456
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,840
I'm pretty excited

457
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Because I'm going to make this short

458
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Because I'm not even very soon

459
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm on my way out

460
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,840
I am headed to LagerCon 3

461
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
It's going to be awesome

462
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Podcasting session

463
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I can't wait to meet everybody there

464
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
It's giving me very cool

465
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
I'm actually just going to check the website one more time

466
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm going to make sure I got everything straight

467
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840

468

Okay, got a missed it

471
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,840
All right, well, I'll see you guys at the blogCon 4

472
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
I'll get that one right, okay

473
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Thank you, and good night

474
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Of course, it's still sound a bit empty

475
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
In the podcast theater

476
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
But it's under construction

477
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
And a few weeks there's going to be some great material

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
I'll upload anything you got

510
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
If it comes out like that

511
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Here's something from the mobile podcast

512
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Hi, this is Ruffle Holliman

513
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
You're listening to my trio podcast

514
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Now I just want to say a couple of people pointed me to Russell's recent podcast

515
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
I believe his wife was out of town

516
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
And I quite sure why

517
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,840
But in his longer podcast

518
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
He sounded somewhat inebriated

519
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Mobilepodcast.org

520
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
From my palm to your pod

521
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Nothing but net

522
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
I've got an abbreviated message to send out today

523
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Don't have a whole lot of time to talk

524
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
But something came up and I thought that it was important enough to

525
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
A special abbreviated podcast

526
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
And this one goes out to anybody out there who's currently

527
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Producing a podcast or perhaps contemplating

528
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
Producing one

529
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
That's you

530
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,840
One of the really great things I think we can all agree on

531
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,840
About this new phenomenon is the fact that it is completely unregulated

532
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,840
There's no government agencies involved

533
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
There's no rules

534
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Basically there's nothing to stand between you

535
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
And what you have to say to the world

536
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,840
And right now that is just fantastic

537
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
But I wanted to alert everybody

538
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
To a situation that is brewing

539
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
That very well may change that

540
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Okay

541
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
So this sounds serious

542
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
I know it has for me

543
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I've already received a slap on the wrist

544
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
For a previous podcast of mine

545
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
And I felt it was worth

546
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Warning the rest of you out there

547
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
The podcast in question

548
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
And I don't remember exactly which one it was

549
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,840
But I was discussing some of the funny things in the news

550
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,840
And I made a comment about the fact that

551
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Well that my wife can't seem to cook anything

552
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Unless cream of mushroom soup is in the recipe

553
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
And well

554
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,840
That's right she heard it

555
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,840
So I've already been put on notice

556
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,840
I am podcasting under a probationary license

557
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I was fine two blouses in a pedicure

558
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
And told that one more interaction

559
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
And I'll be at the jewelry store

560
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
So anybody out there who's married

561
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Or has a significant other

562
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
It may not be an FCC listening

563
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
But there certainly is someone

564
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
So watch the back

565
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
And

566
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,840
It's the spousal communications commission

567
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Alright so this is Russell Hollis

568
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
This is my trio podcast

569
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Thank you for tuning in

570
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
MobilePodcast.org

571
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Please come check us out

572
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
From my palm to your pod

573
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Nothing but net

574
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
I don't want your palm on my pod

575
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Okay, I can't wait you say Russell

576
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Definitely don't want that happening

577
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
You should hear is his full length podcast

578
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
It was funny he was home alone

579
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
And definitely

580
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
By his own admission

581
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Someone a new brain

582
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Good morning

583
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Welcome to today's podcast

584
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Brief Daily podcast

585
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Offering words for the wise and the otherwise

586
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm Scott Brenner and today is November 14th

587
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
2004

588
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Building on the positive comments

589
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
I got regarding my first podcast

590
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Today's word is interstitial

591
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Like that first podcast

592
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
We're disambiguation

593
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Interstitial is one of those

594
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Possibly pretentious

595
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Specialized jargon words

596
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Straight literal definition of interstitial is

597
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
The space between two states

598
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
In the context of the web

599
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
It refers to the page

600
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Between pages

601
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Two great sites

602
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
It frequently used them are Yahoo Games

603
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
And salon.com

604
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
They used them to show you an ad

605
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Before you get to the stuff you really want

606
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
In the case of Yahoo Games you get to see an ad

607
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Before you get to play a free game of back

608
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Salon uses them the same way

609
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
You want to read this article

610
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Watch this ad

611
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Salons interstitials are pretty interesting

612
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Because of the high concept multimedia

613
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
That they use in them

614
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Often movie previews that kind of stuff

615
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Or movie trailers

616
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
I guess that's the fancy word form

617
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,840
And the articles are pretty good on salon too

618
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,840
There are many other context where the text

619
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
We got interstitial

620
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
That's today's word

621
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
I guess we must have missed a little

622
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Although I'm sure it was a word of the day

623
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
That's today's podcast.com

624
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Subscribe to that from the ipod.org directory

625
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Or go to the website and subscribe directly

626
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
I like that

627
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
I like a word of the day

628
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,840
And I did like today's word being interstitial

629
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Interstitial

630
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I wonder if

631
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
They came into interstitials on podcasting

632
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
I guess I would just be called a bad commercial

633
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
It sounds like everything there

634
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
You've got to watch this stop

635
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
So we can't have interstitials

636
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Or maybe

637
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Interstitials, maybe podcasts or the interstitials

638
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Between your music on your iPod

639
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Is that possible?

640
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
Got some exciting news

641
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,840
The Ken and Cindy show

642
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Or should I say it's the Ken and Squip show

643
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Two people who I used to work with

644
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Ken Clark worked at MTV for God

645
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
He must have been there

646
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
For several years

647
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
As the VJ talent coordinator

648
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Before even I got there

649
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
We worked together for the

650
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Man

651
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
All that I was there for seven and a half years

652
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
But the last two years I think

653
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I hired Ken away from MTV to come and work for me

654
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
And then when we started to grow our company

655
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
He moved into the company and he witnessed everything

656
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
All the way through

657
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Going public

658
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
And Cindy

659
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
I hired her right off the internet

660
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,840
When we had just started on ramp

661
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
And we were looking for some people to help sell

662
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,840
And market with creative ideas

663
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
And so that was Cindy

664
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
So I know both these people fairly well

665
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Actually I know them really well

666
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Let's see

667
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Ken, you know, Ken

668
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Even used to babysit Christina

669
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
He's a member of the family, right?

670
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Ken, right?

671
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Yes, okay

672
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
He still speaks Dutch

673
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
He used to be at the house every single day

674
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Ken, Ken

675
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
He always speaks his Dutch words

676
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Anyway

677
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
And then Cindy

678
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I know intimately because she puked on me once

679
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
But that's a story

680
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Only she can tell

681
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
So they're podcasting

682
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
And they're in the directory

683
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
I think I put them under a comedy

684
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Also under well they're in one of the what's new

685
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
You can you can find it easily

686
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I potted out org

687
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Let's just listen to a little bit of the Ken and

688
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Squip show

689
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
I have a joke to tell you

690
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Oh go ahead

691
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
What is perfectly adorable

692
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Go to snoo

693
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
And there's seven tiny little dancing

694
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
But snow outside

695
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
But snow outside

696
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,840
And now lives

697
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,840
And now lives

698
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
So we are sitting with us

699
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
There are nothing other regions of the universe

700
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Spits the Ken and Squip show

701
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
When your house comes to the day

702
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
And Cindy the Squip

703
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
And now from our spanking new run

704
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Last video from the upper west side of Manhattan

705
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Here's Ken and Squip

706
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Hello, Squip

707
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Hello, Kenny

708
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
I should point out right here

709
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
That today's broadcast

710
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Is brought to you courtesy of Skype

711
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
The latest and internet telephony

712
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Yeah

713
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
That's Skype as in www.scipe.com

714
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,840
You might want to give a whirl

715
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Because we're by coastal

716
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
So they're actually doing this old podcast via Skype

717
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
And listen to this first show

718
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
It's really funny

719
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
They actually had Patricia and I

720
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
With tears rolling down our cheeks

721
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
It's dry humor

722
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Very dry humor

723
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
And just like this podcast

724
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
It's not safe for work

725
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Yeah

726
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
One, two, three, four

727
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,840
If you could get a Martha Glenn's phone number

728
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
You know, I'm playing the cover of the one

729
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
So it's microphones off

730
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
It is?

731
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh, hey Adam, how are you doing?

732
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
It's Brian from covervill.com

733
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
I wanted to drop you a quick line

734
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
To thank you first of all for

735
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
All the publicity you've got in covervill

736
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
On the last few days

737
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I really appreciate it and my bandwidth

738
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Is just through the roof

739
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Thanks to you man, so appreciate it

740
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I also wanted to

741
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I want to let you know

742
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
How often do people thank you for sucking up all their bandwidth

743
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
Now that's a beautiful thing

744
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Oh, that ended this year

745
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm going to be doing a

746
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Countdown kind of a casey case

747
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Some style best covers

748
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
And for Countdown

749
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Where I'm going to take emails

750
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
From anyone who wants to email me

751
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
With their favorite cover

752
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
And you can email me at Brian at covervill.com

753
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Or you can post something on the weblog

754
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Or you can call my voice mail

755
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
314-24-89957

756
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Ring

757
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
So if any of your listeners want to

758
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Send me their favorite cover

759
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
I'm going to tell you all the results

760
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
And my last five or six shows this year

761
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Sometime in December at the end of December

762
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Will be a Countdown

763
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Of the best cover

764
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
And they don't have to be from

765
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
2004

766
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
They can be from any time and it can be something I've played

767
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Or something I haven't played

768
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
But just wanted to pass that on to

769
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
So you can pass that on to your listeners if you like

770
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
And

771
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
See if anybody's interested

772
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
But thank you very much

773
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
And love the daily source code

774
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Boy, boy, boy

775
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,360
much cool. So cover real coming out with a countdown at the end of the year. All right. Well,

776
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,880
just let me know when I know if it's going to be on the cover real feed, if you're going to put

777
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,400
up a separate feed for it, but I will certainly let everyone know. And you know, people are using

778
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,240
the source code stuff for so many different things in different places. Hey, my name is David Johnson.

779
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:06,080
I'm from the Seattle area and got my first iPod about a month ago and stumbled across

780
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,720
the iPod or stuff while searching for nifty tricks and tools to do things to do with my iPod.

781
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,960
And I just wanted to thank you for the brainchild that you created that is podcasting. It's given me

782
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,040
things to do in the morning. You know, I read magazines a lot faster than I used to. And so now,

783
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,800
when I'm out of magazines, I have something to do during my morning constitutional. You've given me

784
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,240
fabulous reading time as it were in the bathroom. Thanks a lot. And also have to throw a plug in.

785
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:49,200
I just started my own podcast talking about computer security and updating that regularly as

786
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:57,760
issues come out. And it can be found at www.edave.org. That's the e-dave security news.

787
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,880
Thanks again for iPodding. And hey, have a good move, huh? See ya.

788
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,120
Hey, Adam Scott Westernman here with a quick note of thanks for the work you Dave Winner and

789
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,840
others have done to make the podcasting dream real. You're certainly inspired me.

790
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,160
I've revolved. The last couple of years I've hosted a website celebrating the history of my

791
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:36,640
favorite 1960s Detroit radio station, WKNR. You can check us out at kiner13.com. That's k-e-e-n-e-r13.com.

792
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,120
Well, since discovering the daily source code about a month ago, we've been podcasting

793
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,320
and it's been great fun. Plug our RSS file into your iPodder and check it out.

794
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:55,520
It's feeds.feedburner.com slash the kiner blog. Or you can click on the XML link at www.kiner13.com.

795
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,160
Now, do you hear something here? I mean, this is a radio guide. I love hearing this because radio

796
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,680
people are so hot on podcasting. And there's one thing that there's a huge benefit coming out of this

797
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:13,760
is that you have to understand that there are people who are trying to codify and archive

798
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,440
radio programs to such a meticulous degree because all that shit is normally lost. It's the same

799
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,200
with television. If you really want to go back and find something in archives, it's very, very

800
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,840
difficult. Same thing with podcasts. What's going to happen? Eventually, they're going to be

801
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,400
runoff onto a CD or whatever an archive, they may be about to stay around. I think these people

802
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,320
are really important. In fact, as a guy at Tom Schoeding in Australia who archives all of my stuff,

803
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:50,800
I never asked him to do it. I just have or just about to send off a box of 300 cassette tapes

804
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,600
of shows that I've done. He's going to digitize him and make him available online.

805
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,120
So when you run across someone who's doing this and you see how powerful it is being

806
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,880
able to do that on a podcast, it's great because we're building up an archive that otherwise

807
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,040
would not exist. Slash blog. We podcast every Saturday. And this week's show features an interview

808
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,720
with Andrew Reeve, the author of a classic book about the famous Paul McCartney Death Hokes.

809
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,280
Oh, cool. This is that Saturday. Hope you enjoy it. And by the way, one of these days,

810
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,720
we ought to do a simultaneous podcast via Skype. I'd love to have you as a guest and it would be

811
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,720
fun to share one piece of one of another's programs with our respective listeners.

812
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,160
That sounded nasty, but I think it's a good idea. Anyway, best regards from the

813
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,920
cornfields of the Midwest and I hope you're moved to England is going well.

814
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,920
And you know, they don't just grow corn and then corn fields, you know, I'm pretty sure

815
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,000
they grow more. So I have to come and visit you. John Oblang sent us an email, 11

816

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,280
are the guys who kind of run Solana Records. And you know what? You came back. You, you

821

852
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,240

Guying that played this weekend, so you can decide if you want to send it later,

that's what's coming up, oh and of course I'll be doing all of this in my

858
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
underwear.

859
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,680
So we're turning the whole podcast, we'll not podcasting, but audio

860
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,440
comment thing, I'm using the garage band, sound for, or and all that stuff,

861
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,520
actually, which I knew what you use because it always sounds really good, but if

862
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,320
it's just garage game, that would be really great, at the stupid mention I'm

863
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,880
going in my ear and heaped that thing, it just messes you up and he can't shut

864
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,840
it off once you start this thing.

865
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,320
So loving listening to the daily source, the way my name's Elana, I look

866
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,400
Dublin with my husband, Brendan, and our son, and obviously I don't sound

867
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Irish.

868
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,000
We've been here for about five years and I don't sound like Madonna with her

869
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,800
fake little thing, we're just gonna be in here, we love and listening to

870
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,120
daily source code, he and I listen to it most days when he's working, he'll

871
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,320
be listening to it, no, listen to it, well I'm checking my email and stuff, well

872
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,720
he's listening to it and we're always cracking up and stuff, about things and I

873
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:41,200
just heard about the one about David Bowie and Patricia, which was hilarious, it is

874
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,040
really nice to know that you're larger than Bowie.

875
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Boy, oh yeah, I mean, not to be some kind of pat on the back.

876
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,760
Yeah, not just in the back, yeah, boy, oh yeah, boy.

877
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,600
I think it's all good, I'm gonna work on doing my own podcast at some point, but I

878
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,360
want to do one about cooking.

879
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,360
I know there's one other person out there doing cooking, I haven't listened to it yet,

880
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,360
but I'm gonna check it out and see, but no, it's maybe he and I can join the forces or

881
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:10,720
something, but loving it, keep it up, it's all good, thanks a million, later.

882
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,400
Okay, Alanna, yeah, no problem, you're very welcome, cooking a podcast would be good,

883
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,400
you know the BBC where they were here, they're actually focusing on that and I went to

884
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,520
the directory, I think there's only one podcast, the vegan.com, the vegan podcast, that would

885
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,800
be very cool.

886
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,080
So yeah, thanks for the other comment, no, you did not at all sound like Madonna.

887
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:36,880
So I went into the iTunes Music Store the other day and I had already registered because

888
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,720
now the European Union can buy stuff from it and immediately what I went to the audiobooks,

889
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,720
I found out that audible.com actually provides all of the audiobooks in the iTunes Music Store,

890
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,760
and I got marketed immediately, I was very happy about it, it popped right up, that

891
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,240
George Carlin has a new book out, I didn't even know the book was out, let alone the

892
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,760
audiobook, it's titled, When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops, and I haven't heard,

893
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,160
I've only heard an hour, about an hour and 50 minutes, almost two hours of it, and the

894
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:18,720
whole thing is I believe about seven or seven and a half hours, it's the unabridged version,

895
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:27,760
and it is once again just totally beautiful, every so many years, George Carlin comes out

896
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,560
with his view on life, his take on what's going on, and it's current, and it's political,

897
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:40,480
and it's certainly politically incorrect, but you can't help but just wonder the power

898
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,200
of pure intellect that goes into what he writes and what comes out of his mouth, and when

899
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,840
he performs it for an audience or whether he's performing it in an audiobook, it comes across,

900
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,280
it really does, and I'm going to be picking snippets from his book for the next a couple days.

901
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,040
Question? Yes, question? Stop the show. Yeah, stop the show. Yeah, and the turning and everything

902
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,600
in the bathroom, so do you have all your stuff doing? All my stuff, shaving, creams, and things

903
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:17,840
that keep you young, and maybe I should put all the more to rise this? What should I put

904
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,120
in, and where should I put the stuff that I need? I better do that now then. Yeah, I'm going to

905
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,720
have to do this with this to go with this side. Okay, you want to help me? So, I'm going to ask for that.

906
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,400
I don't think you're all.

907
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:42,080
Yeah. Do you think I'm the heart? Yeah. I kind of both. Yeah, I'm a bandica sneller.

908
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,120
They've never been up, the audience has never been upstairs, huh?

909
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,720
The source code has never been upstairs upstairs in the castle. Certainly not in our bedroom.

910
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:13,360
Or the bathroom. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So, I need that, need that, need some guys pack.

911
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:22,560
Yeah, shaving cream, the mystery. I try to send me a message.

912
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:30,160
Okay. Maybe you think you're done?

913
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,160
I'm telling you, a blogger con.

914
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:43,760
No, think about this. It was like three or three of the people and we started eight o'clock in the

915
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:51,120
clock and we talked a lot and we had coffee and then what do you think? I don't know.

916
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,280
But how do you think that what was the experience for everyone who'd been drinking coffee and talking

917
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,480
and then look at the listerine? I don't know. What were you doing? People were stanky.

918
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,000
Oh, have people in there? Yeah, I'll take the people in there.

919
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:24,720
I tried to keep tabs on the phone. I had my mint. What else do I need?

920
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:33,600
Okay, so they can't take these, but how about this? I mean, this is going to dump that into

921
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:40,400
something and just keep leaving in here and take it. It's going to pack that right up like that and

922
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,720
they'll unpack it and we'll be with that stuff. Why don't you call me? Where's the top to that?

923
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,080
And you have to throw it out. Okay.

924
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,920
Okay, do I have a hair? A blow dryer? A blow dryer?

925
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,720
Where? I don't know.

926
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,920
Yeah. What about that? You packed up?

927
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,440
Yeah, everything's going to be packed up. You moved before everyone's gone found.

928
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,680
This, this they all going to pack. Yeah, that's fine.

929
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,320
But they got to pack. Okay, so they're not going to pack these.

930
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,920
Then what's dirty? Yeah, then what's packed? Christine has to pay no.

931
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,520
I'm going to take my belt before they pack that.

932
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,240
I'm going to pack this. I'm going to pack that. I'll have no house coat to wear.

933
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,680
I'll have no house coat. Can they pack that tomorrow?

934
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:51,600
She needs something to skip it. Can I just go finish my show? Yes.

935
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:17,360
Now, Christina. Christina, you better get something for you to wear tonight. Otherwise,

937
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,720
you'll have nothing because they're packing it all up and no mom said you don't have anything

938
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:30,240
for this evening yet and you better do it because I don't know for night close. Do you wear a

939
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,520
like to wear underwear and a t-shirt or what are you wearing?

940
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,280
You sure it's on your bag. Okay. Mom got the impression it wasn't. Sorry about that. Okay.

941
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,720
Here's George Carlin. I'm a modern man, a man for the Millennium digital and smoke-free.

942
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,640
A diversified multicultural postmodern deconstruction is politically anatomically and ecologically incorrect.

943
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,720
I've been uplinked and downloaded. I've been inputted and outsourced. I know the upside-down

944
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,080
sizing. I know the downside of upgrading. I'm a high-tech low-life, a cutting-edge state-of-the-art

945
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:18,480
bicostal multitasker and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond. I'm new wave, but I'm old school.

946
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,760
And my inner child is outward-bound. I'm a hot-wired heat-seeking warm-hearted cool customer.

947
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,440
Voice-activated and biodegradable. A interface from a database,

948
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,040
medatabases, and cyberspace. So I'm interactive, a hyperactive, and from time to time, I'm radioactive.

949
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,760
Behind the eight-ball ahead of the curve, riding the wave, dodging the bullet push in the envelope.

950
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,920
I'm on point on task, on message and off drugs. I got no need for co-conspeed. I got no urge to binge

951
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,960
and purge. I'm in the moment on the edge over the top, but under the radar. A high-concept-low

952
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,640
profile, medium-range ballistic missionary, a street-wise smart bomb, a top-gun bottom-feeter.

953
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,840
I wear powerties, I tell powerties, I take powenaps, I run victory laps. I'm a totally

954
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:05,520
ongoing big-foot slam dunk-rain maker with a proactive outreach, a raging workaholic, a working

955
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:11,840
rageaholic, out-of-rehab, and in denial. I got a personal trainer, a personal shop, a personal assistant,

956
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,360
and a personal agenda. You can't shut me up, you can't dumb me down, because I'm tireless,

957
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,560
and I'm wireless. I'm an alpha male on beta blockers. I'm a non-believer, I'm an over-achiever,

958
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:28,160
laid-back, and fashion-forward, up front-down-home low-rent high-maintenance. I'm supersized

959
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,760
long-lasting high-definition fast-acting oven-ready and built-to-last. A hands-on-foot-loose knee-jerk

960
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,800
head-case prematurely post-traumatic, and I have a love child who sends me hate mail,

961
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:45,040
but I'm feeling, I'm caring, I'm healing, I'm sharing, a supportive bonding nurturing primary caregiver.

962
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,880
My output is down to my income, is up. I take a short position on the long bond,

963
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,040
and my revenue stream has its own cash flow. I re-junk mail, eat junk food,

964
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,400
I buy junk bonds, I watch trash sports. I'm gender-specific capital intensive user-friendly

965
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,160
and lactose intolerant. I like rough sex. I like tough love. I use the F-word in my email,

966
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,840
and the software on my hard drive is hard-core, no-soft porn. I bought a micro-wave in a minimal,

967
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,800
about an in-evan, and a megastore. I eat fast food in the slow lane. I'm told free,

968
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:20,000
bite-sized, ready-to-wear, and I come in all sizes. A fully equipped factory-authorized hospital

969
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,800
tested clinically proven scientifically formulated medical miracle. I've been pre-washed pre-cooked,

970
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,960
pre-heated pre-screen, pre-approved, pre-packaged post-dated, freeze-dried, double-wrapped,

971
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,120
and vacuum-packed, and I have an unlimited broadband capacity. I'm a rude dude, but I'm the real

972
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:41,520
deal. Lean and mean, cock-blocked and ready-to-rock, rough-tuff-and-hard-to-bluff. I take it slow. I go with

973
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,640
the flow. I ride with the tide. I got glide in my stride. Driving and moving, sailing and spinning,

974
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:51,200
driving and grooving, well-in-win-in. I don't snooze, so I don't lose. I keep the pedal to the

975
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,720
metal and the rubber on the road. I party-hardy and lunchtime is crunch time. I'm hanging in,

976
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:03,600
there ain't no doubt, and I'm hanging tough over and out. The cool is that George Carling,

977
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,200
the wind up today is Daily Source Code. We'll have to do the rest tomorrow.

978
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:15,040
We just had to go on that little tour upstairs to go pack up my toiletries. So what I'm going to

979
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,440
save for tomorrow is a Holy Radio, another audio comment, the one minute tip and the stuff that I

980
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,080
has, the excerpts that I pulled from the Go-Hor gang. So we're going to make it just about an hour for

981
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:33,840
a day. So tomorrow is another move day. As I said, multi-day sessions here.

982
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:40,240
So probably you have even less around us. Nothing to play with, as you always do, or keeping the

983
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,880
airport for laptops. Actually, because you just can't figure out about to be packed up as well.

984
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,000
As I always comment, and we really love the audio comments. Adam and Frey.com. Leave a comment

985
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,280
in the live.grade.com, or check out the new shows, the archives, and DailySource Code.com. I'll see you tomorrow.

986
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,000
Bye, bye, bye, everybody.
