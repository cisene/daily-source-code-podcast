1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is my casting. It's Adam Curry.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The power of the door.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hump day. It is...

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Davies Westcode. We're using the developers party together.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to everybody coming to you from Curry Castle and Flanders Belgium for the very last time.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Once again, it is your Davies source code.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For Wednesday, November 17th, 2004.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, everybody. This is it. The final one from the castle.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We are so ready to get out of here.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's just so totally fricking boring.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There's nothing to do. Nothing here.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's just taking care of business.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There was a lot of business to take care of today.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's see. I felt like I was living on two sides.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Two different dimensions of the same moment and time.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're on one hand. I'm trying to finalize the contract with these guys that are renting the bunker and Amsterdam for the reality show for the Trump-like apprentice type show with a famous Dutch lawyer.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm trying to close the contract on that.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can imagine when you have a television production crew.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You want to really shore up a whole bunch of stuff because you know they're going to wreck the house.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's just the way it works. That's where television works.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So no problem as long as they take care of it.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So you know working with bank guarantees and all this shit.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So I'm kind of like in the cat bird seed because they have to start shooting on Sunday.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They just as typical TV production goes.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They took too long to get all this shit together.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I'm sitting pretty and I'm really no rush.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Conversely, at the same moment Patricia is over in the UK trying to, you know,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
get our home.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I told you that we're going to be renting for at least a year just to get our bearings and see if we want to live where

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we know what we've selected.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And you know, and we also were thinking of downsizing somewhat in just in general, in life in general.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So while she's over there trying to, so we're doing, I'm trying to, you know,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
get these guys to, you know, finish up the contract on my terms.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The wire transfer, which we sent initiated last Thursday had as of this morning still not arrived.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And of course, you don't get a key if you haven't paid your deposit.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, so it's a sizable amount of money.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And well, you know, so I'm still going to figure out where it is, which is,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it's just fucking ridiculous, you know, with these banks to, you know, under the, under the

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
concept of, or the term of, you know, we're clearing your funds.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Fuck that.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can send an email in three seconds, you know, they're clearly using the money.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But, you know, what does it take, you know, I'll pay extra just to get my fucking money there on the

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
same day, same minute, same hour, same second, it's ridiculous.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So of course Patricia wound up having to go to a, to a Barclays bank nearby the home.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And using her credit cards to get the required funds, which is a big number.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So it was pretty funny.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But there was a Dutch girl or woman who worked at the bank.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And she recognized Patricia and said, oh, no problem.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We'll hook you up.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So that worked out.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But you can see where I felt that I was kind of on two different dimensions of the same equation.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So it felt very, very surreal.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I spent a lot of time working on that and just getting the move all set up, you know,

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
financial moving, tax moving, all this stuff.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It all kind of comes down to the same moment, excuse me.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, nice cup of cup of tea.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm getting into the mood here.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me see.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, man, the BBC want to come and reshoot on Friday.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I got a voicemail message and normally I would have said, yeah, that's a definite,

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but I think we're going to have a big problem here.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Houston, because I spoke to Patricia.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She called about half an hour ago.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It was a quarter to eleven here.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So a quarter to ten you, UK time.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And the moving guys had just finished bringing everything into the house.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They haven't even started unpacking.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So they're going to do that tomorrow.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But Patricia said, you know, you're not going to believe it,

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but we still have too much stuff.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And she said, I'm sending stuff back.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I told you that we wanted to downsize.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Because we had like three houses worth of stuff.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I don't know.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think Patricia had totally mapped it out in her head, which she wanted.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And then all this other stuff, all just figure a place for it.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But you know, there's just no physical place for some stuff.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And so we'd already paired down so much.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And we thought that, you know, we were doing pretty good,

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but it turns out we could do even better.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And we come to think of it.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is shit that we never missed.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I didn't even know we fucking had this stuff.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, it's just stuff.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it's furniture stuff.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so she's sending some back.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's great.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So tomorrow Christina and I,

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
we fly over.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And so tomorrow afternoon we should be in.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know if we can be able to do a source code.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I do certainly not be with clips and stuff like that, because I won't have any real

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
connectivity to to connectivity to speak of.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So it will be a bit rough for the next couple of days.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But you know, me, I'll find a Wi-Fi nearby or I'll just drive in a town or whatever.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And looking forward to the adventure.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Patricia sounded really upbeat and really happy even though she's dead,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
dead, dead, dead fucking tired.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And when I say dead with a heart patient, you know,

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you got to be careful what you say because she's,

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
she's really been pushing herself to the limits and it's almost been over doing it.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
She sounded really happy, and her sister's there helping her.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so tomorrow, you know, they're going to work on work on unpacking some stuff.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And she said the kitchen is great.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She loves the way the kitchen is turning out.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it's cool.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And you know what?

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We are so ready to be gone.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We're ready to be out of here and start.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
New fun and new stuff in the land of make believe.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Now before you listen any further to this show about five minutes into it,

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you want to alert you to find service that comes from Nick Star.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And he is doing something rather interesting.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He's creating and providing a mini daily source code,

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
which is kind of his abbreviated version of this podcast.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For people who just don't have the 40 45 minutes to an hour depending on,

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you know, how good, you know, how important or excited I am about something,

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
how important something seems to be.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But you know, 40 minutes, you don't have time for that on your commute.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You can always listen to the abbreviated source code.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You can find them at Nickstar.com.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And now in the production knows I'm doing a better job of getting the podcast feeds,

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the website, and email information all into one single outline.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So let's listen to a little bit here of the mini source code.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
From my Nickstar.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's cool.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's very flattering.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I got a little bit of RIA for music.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This band is the plain white teas.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Band, I'm actually a personal friend with their great.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They're out touring right now.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Plainwhite teas.com.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Check that out.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is a great song by them.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They said I could totally use this song.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So everything's cool.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
All right.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is the mini source code for Tuesday, November 16th.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is the wrap up of what Adam Curry's daily source code is all about.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So you're running on the hallway.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You don't have the extra time.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Grab your mini iPod.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Throw on the mini source code.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So all that's left in the curry castle right now is just two cats, two dogs,

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Christine, one bed, one small TV, and two laptops.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's it.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's a little fire going on the fireplace.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Christine is on a windows laptop and break in her dad's heart.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And we all know that.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So Patricia's up in Ireland.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And there's a funny Adam walking around the house.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And he's walking to do, to do, to do, to do.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So okay.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can check out the mini source code.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You can subscribe to the podcast feed.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can do a straight from the production notes for this show.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A daily source code.com or you can just go to Nickstar.com.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it's funny how all kinds of mistakes come into this.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Patricia's definitely not an island.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's Christina and not Christine.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So it's kind of like the game of telephone.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So it gets interesting.

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But I certainly appreciate the effort.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And it really made me laugh to hear in fact how trivial these podcasts can be.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But yet so somehow disturbingly exciting.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know what I'm saying?

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Just like the interaction that we get in audio comments.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You probably remember yesterday I plugged a great way to learn Spanish.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
A new podcast that is going to, I think blows the doors off of any type of self-help,

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you know, self-learned language course.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And that's in the iPod.org directory.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now listen to Victor Von Reesling's real podcast on how to really learn Spanish.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's in girls is that?

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He Von Reesling radio show coming from studio city, California.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Welcome.

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, show.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have no idea.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But we've got things for you to listen to.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And maybe even a couple of guests.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The very first thing probably.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm Von Reesling of the Thamaturgic Cartographers.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I had to look it up.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, you know, there's a dictionary online.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thamaturgic.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THA nevermind.

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Here, let's just set the tone and let me give you a little bit of education up front

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
if you're not familiar with the Spanish language.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Each shit and die.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Go and let me hear that email at the.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Each shit and die.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go and let me hear that email at the.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
See, now I took two years of Spanish in high school, public school.

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I didn't learn any of the useful Spanish.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The first thing you learned when you're learning other languages.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How to cuss, right?

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But we had to look it up in the dictionary.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, kiss my ass was like, best of me as no.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Which turns out isn't right.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's like the dictionary definition.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Kiss my ass.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Bessa Mikulu.

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Kiss my ass.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Bessa Mikulu.

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bessa Mikulu.

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Bessa Mikulu.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, right on.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, that's Victor Von Reesling.

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh, of course, links to his feed and his site in the.

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In the show notes for today's daily source code.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's already the 17th of November, 2004 tomorrow.

212
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The 18th were finally moving.

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We're out of here.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've been really happy with the.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Suggestions that I've been getting for my.

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh, my, um, I potter year problem.

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm wearing the headphones as soon as they're wearing the.

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The Mac alley headphones.

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I like them a lot.

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Got some.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Uh, so now the.

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, I talked about how the earrings were.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Uh, digging into the side of my head.

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Uh, Doug.

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Uh, Welch says take a pair of side cutters to the earring.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Stood trim and down to size.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Then file a sand off the newly trimmed point.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Uh, are you a power tools kind of guy?

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Uh, no.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And I need my workbench.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I need my black and thicker workbench to adjust my earring.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So it doesn't hurt while I'm podcasting.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Uh, uh, Cindy's script had a suggestion as well.

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's quick.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It responds to your free for earring help.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I have a solution.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Walk through.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hit me.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Something about relief you have seen.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Um, first.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is what you have to.

244
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're here.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Get yourself to cotton balls.

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, that sounds like shit.

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What is it?

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This came in as a wave file.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I transferred it to MP3, but it sounds crappy.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's see if we can get through it because she's actually got some real advice that

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't understand.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And, um, put one cotton ball through the post.

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Put it ear in your ear.

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Put it in another cotton ball and put it through the back of the post.

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And then put the ear touch or post.

256
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Um, actually they're ear nuts.

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Watch his or screws.

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We can not.

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Um, expertise that holds the earring onto your ear.

260
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Put that on.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And see if that helps.

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Um, if not, your only other option is to take hearing loss.

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Take care of completely because no matter what you do, um, just a combo.

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't work.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's going to hurt your ears.

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And, um, you have a small zip rock pad.

267
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can put the hearing in.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
See your podcast and then put that in your ear.

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's the solution for today.

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hi.

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Thanks, uh, script.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know, that's, um, taking the earring out freaks me out.

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have to understand that Patricia came up with this great idea of a pierced ear.

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, they look so hot, honey.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Um, now I'm talking 10.

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I was more than 10 years ago.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Maybe it was 13 for me.

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It was 15 years ago.

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
16, 14 or 15 years ago.

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Um, and I said, well, you know, I just freaks me out.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't want it.

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm like needles and I'm weird about that.

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And, uh, and I said, well, tell you what, you know, I'm going to go get this ear pierced.

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But then I'm taking back one of the diamond earrings that I've given you in the past.

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And I'll take that one that nice, big fat one.

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So you'll have one and I'll have one.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Um, and so that was cool.

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And, you know, I really put it in and, you know, after you get like a training earring.

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I'm just just a fucking worst.

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't take them out.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It freaks me out to have to take it out and then put it back in.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Just the whole idea of inserting the earring into this hole in my ear.

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It freaks me out.

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So that's not an option as far as I'm concerned.

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And then Christina, who, of course, is not here right now, which has been listening along

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the source codes for the past couple of weeks.

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We've been in close quarters here in the bar in the past couple of days.

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Um, and she says, well, you know, dad, the solution is you got to, um, you know,

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
put the headphones on like this and put the, uh, the strap nut at the top of your head,

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
but either at the back or in the front.

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I said, oh my God, that's like the gay Abba look.

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now, if anyone remembers, uh, you know, Agueta and Frida from Abba, um, they were,

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
they were, they were, I think it was like, either all their songs or most of them.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They'd be sitting at the, when there was a studio, uh, shot of Abba, uh,

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
then they would be singing with their headphones, not on the top of their head.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Probably not so as to ruin their hair, which is what I always thought.

311
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Um, but more with the, uh, the head piece that connects the two speaker shell things

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that go over your ear, uh, over their forehead or, uh,

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
at the back underneath at the back of their neck.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And now I'm understanding it.

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, I'm understanding this whole Abba vibe.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It could have been because of the, um, because they're earrings, because it hurts.

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And you know that it's fucking trouble when you start to understand what Abba is all about.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Damn.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm, um, Baron Sachea sent me an email, uh, and he sent me a link to an MP2 file,

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
which I never even heard of.

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Of course, I turned it into an MP3 file.

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Uh, and he also has a link to a pretty cool website, um,

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that, uh, has all kinds of binoral recordings, which basically means having fun with audio

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
in stereo.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So here's, uh, a nice stereo track of some dogs, uh, that you want to crank up your, uh,

326
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
your MP3 player right now, because it really just reminds you how beautiful audio can be.

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, hey.

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Come out.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Come out.

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come out.

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let me jump.

332
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Come.

333
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on.

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Dude, I don't know if, if, if you like to drink, or, uh, or if it's, uh, weed, or if it's, uh,

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
whatever it is you do, whatever your poison, you know, if it's just pure oxygen you get high on.

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Man, take a hit off of whatever it is and listen to that recording again.

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That dog was in my brain.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That was awesome.

339
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Um, we've just forgotten, I think, about how beautiful audio can be.

340
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And even though this will be sampled down to 64 kilobits, I still think you can get the full effect.

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean, that was, that was not really blew me away.

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
New podcast news, um, based upon, actually, I picked, I, I didn't pick this up from the,

343
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
from this email, but this email did come in from, uh, John DeSauer, I guess his name is.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Um, and, uh, which reminds me, I wanted to plug it. He says, um,

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
uh, I'm new to the entire podcast in the world, I think podcast is going to explode over the next year.

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm the meteorologist from my TV station KFVSTV in Cape Gerardo, Missouri.

347
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Also work as the station webmaster, just set up a podcast of our, uh, new block.

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's a commercial free block that he'd like to include in the podcasting site.

349
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So I got his feed into, uh, into the iPart.org directory, of course.

350
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But I just want you to listen this because it's really, it's really trippy.

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I listen to this, um, and even though I'm not seeing the pictures, even though it's a television newscast,

352
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I still feel like I'm, I'm really a part of this news.

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And it just gives me, even the sound that, that you can tell that it's coming from the TV, uh,

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
uh, from a TV recording.

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It just kind of takes me there. It sounds really good.

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're watching KFVS12, you're live, local, like breaking source for news with Mimi Jquip,

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jeff Cunningham, Bob Reeves, and Wendy Ray.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Now, hot land news at five.

359
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Education's going to be a big deal. It's going to be one of the biggest things.

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A heart-end group puts its faith into a new plan to keep teens from turning to drugs.

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Good afternoon. Everybody, Missouri ranks number one in the nation.

362
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, well, well, well, did you hear it? Did you hear what she said?

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
She said, good afternoon. It's kind of soft. That's too bad.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But she said, good afternoon, everybody.

365
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know. I don't know. I'm okay.

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
A heart-end group puts its faith into a new plan to keep teens from turning to drugs.

367
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Good afternoon, everybody.

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Good afternoon, everybody.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Seriously, though. It's really cool.

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The volume could be a little bit louder on that KFVS podcast.

371
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But otherwise, I love it. I just love listening to it.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Got a couple responses to what we're talking about.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes, they would rockster who were teaming up with this new company

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
to do streaming, peer to peer transfer of music instead of downloads.

375
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And I posted a couple of email responses to that,

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
which definitely counter what they're saying.

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So I'm not going to read the entire emails to you,

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but the show notes, but I'm a mosquito. What the hell is he doing here?

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's moving the winter.

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So the show notes include all kinds of jurisprudence and legal shit

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that definitely counters what those guys were saying.

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So that's just a part of our ongoing service here.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
As you go from podcasts to podcasts, wondering what the fuck

384
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I was talking about yesterday. You can actually kind of follow along.

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, we're very, very user-oriented here at the Daily Source Code.

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey, what's up Adam? This is Julian talking to you

387
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
from in over your head rate.

388
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, Canada, so how do a couple comments and questions for you?

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So if you have the time to respond, I'd be really chill.

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Let me see.

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, I had some time right now, sure.

392
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
One, in the trade secrets that came out on the seventh,

393
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you talked about the Mac mice, USB mic.

394
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Now, I don't want you to plug anything on your show.

395
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
If you don't want to, of course,

396
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
but that's the mic that I was thinking of getting.

397
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And I know it's USB, so there's a bit of delay,

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but I wouldn't really have a problem with that personally.

399
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So I was wondering if you could let me know

400
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
whether or not I should order the thing.

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Okay, Julian, thank you very much for asking.

402
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
As I'm playing back this comment,

403
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm teaching for the mic.

404
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I wanted to talk about and I realized that's been packed, of course.

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But it was Mac mice.

406
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I think it's 49 bucks.

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Mac mice.com.

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The latency was too much for me.

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I love the fact that it's, you know,

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
it's on a bendable swans neck that you would find

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
on one of those USB lights.

412
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I thought the sound quality was quite reasonable.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A little bit muffled, but really quite reasonable.

414
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Certainly for that kind of money.

415
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It had a huge, nice heavy mega bass stand,

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
which made it very convenient to extend it away from the computer

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and put it down somewhere else.

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And it was really sturdy.

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Although the drawback to that is if you pick up the mic by the mic,

420
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
then the bass drops off and smashes into your table.

421
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I also couldn't get it to work,

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
which may have been related to my battery.

423
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And I was going to check that before I did this podcast.

424
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But as I said, it's been packed, but I think

425
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
there may be better USB microphones.

426
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Dawn and Drew are using a logic tech,

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
which is the ugliest piece of crap I've ever seen,

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but it sounds pretty good and they have almost no latency.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So that may be the way to go on that.

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's see if he, if I'd do anything more questions here.

431
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's the first thing.

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The second thing is that I was also listening to your trade secrets today

433
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
on the 13th of about the BBC.

434
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now, I just wanted to comment because it made me so angry.

435
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Here in Montreal last year, I did a couple of shows for a reality TV series,

436
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
which I will not name, but they were exactly like that.

437
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They say reality and the first thing I discovered,

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
there's no such thing as reality programming.

439
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Not at all.

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They want you to say certain things.

441
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They want you to talk a certain way and walk a certain way.

442
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You know what I mean?

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And it just made me so upset to listen to that,

444
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
because they're like, you can't talk about this.

445
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We can't talk about that.

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But please get as much of this as possible into the show.

447
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You know what I mean?

448
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There's no such thing as a reality show.

449
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And that podcast that they will show on their program

450
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
is not going to be the real thing.

451
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And that's what I really love about the podcasting.

452
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So keep it up and keep it real, I guess,

453
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
is what I'm trying to say.

454
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So I think that's pretty much it.

455
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let me know what you think about the mic.

456
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If you have the chance and keep it up,

457
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and keep up the good work.

458
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You look like you're having a lot of really good fun down there.

459
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Bye-bye.

460
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, Boeing indeed.

461
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You bet I'm having fun.

462
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And as I think I said earlier,

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
it looks like the whole BBC thing is going to fall through now

464
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
because the last possible time they had to re-record all this stuff

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
we did this hours we spent on shit.

466
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Only for it to be damaged in transit.

467
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I can't believe it.

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's Friday between like two and five p.m.

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so it's half the amount of time that we spent originally.

470
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And our house isn't ready.

471
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's just too much shit, too much stuff for sending stuff back.

472
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So I'm going to have to call Colin tomorrow

473
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and disappoint him.

474
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And it looks like either it will never happen

475
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
or it won't happen this time, folks.

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But I think there's, you know,

477
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
there's only so much I can do.

478
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And we really tried to do everything for them.

479
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I'm fucking bummed about it.

480
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I think I forgot like helicopters and shit

481
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
into the mix to make it even cool.

482
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But there you go.

483
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's Murphy and shit happens.

484
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Shit just happens.

485
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's see.

486
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What else was I going to talk about here?

487
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, something cool.

488
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I was pointed out to me today

489
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
that Skype has a developer program.

490
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There's a whole Skype API.

491
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And I'm starting you know,

492
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
as Dave always says, I'm your programmer.

493
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm like, you know, believe me,

494
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
you're more a radio podcaster than I am

495
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
programmer if we want to compare.

496
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But I am kind of digging looking at this

497
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
application programming interface.

498
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I think that's what API stands for.

499
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And you know, we can basically, you know,

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
build this into production systems,

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
create voice message systems

502
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
that can loop directly to iPod.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I mean, you might just boggles

504
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
when you think of how you can connect

505
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
all of these wonderful bits together.

506
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So on the show notes for today's podcast,

507
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
download page for their API

508
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and their developer program.

509
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Smart guys, this jannison,

510
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
you know, those Scandinavian dudes,

511
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
man, they're totally freaking smart about this.

512
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Get the developers involved soon.

513
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And it looks pretty open.

514
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It looks like some good stuff is happening there.

515
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And I spoke to, to gaff, kid.

516
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
God, people must, people from Australia

517
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
must hate it when people do their accent.

518
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's a fucking lame.

519
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I've got to stop that.

520
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I've got to stop the English accent too.

521
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's a whole Madonna thing.

522
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's fucked up.

523
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Do not want to go down that path.

524
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So Garth is on the iPod or lemon developer team.

525
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Now, a member yesterday was really excited

526
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
on the source code where I heard

527
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
how these guys had, you know,

528
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
figured that Don and Drew did some really cool stuff

529
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
with their double ender audio recording.

530
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Double ended double ender.

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's a double ender.

532
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, we got to keep the podcast

533
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
when the vocabulary got to keep it straight.

534
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
This is really good.

535
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Did you see that you see on my weblog

536
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
by the way that podcasting

537
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
was word of the day for the Dutch version

538
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
of Webster's dictionary?

539
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What the fuck is that about?

540
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Awesome.

541
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm leaving Holland and, you know,

542
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
when I'm almost a day I'm leaving,

543
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I leave behind a new English word

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
for their dictionary.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Gosh, what's this?

546
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Boy, we're really, you know,

547
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
we're really pushing podcasting

548
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
to the ultimate limits anyway.

549
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So the iPod, a large part of the iPod

550
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
or developer, the lemon development team

551
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
got together and did this multiple ended call

552
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
which they recorded.

553
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Which is great because, you know,

554
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
they're listening to the users

555
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and saying, how can we make this work

556
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and how can we figure this out?

557
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So Garth, I don't think he figured

558
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
that I was actually going to put that

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
entire piece on the podcast.

560
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What's that?

561
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Well, don't put it on my computer.

562
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You like it.

563
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I'm, I'm podcasting.

564
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I have some things.

565
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But what, you don't want it, you don't like it?

566
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well, don't, don't shove it in my face.

567
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Here, put it on.

568
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Give it up.

569
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm explaining about something.

570
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Okay, thank you very much.

571
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Thank you.

572
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Would Christina?

573
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Why does she just take this with you, huh?

574
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Do your kids do that if they,

575
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm not going to chuck it.

576
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't throw food.

577
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Just take that and put it back and close it up.

578
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
If your kids don't like something,

579
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
they say, here I got this for you.

580
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You know, and they, they give you something totally disgusting.

581
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Anyway, so the, I put it on the developer team.

582
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They recorded their Skype call

583
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and they kind of almost forgot to record how they did it

584
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and what all the settings were.

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But of course, you know,

586
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
we're all connected with these podcasts

587
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and Garth, the, uh, sent me an audio comment

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and titled How We Recorded That Skype Call.

589
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
My next time I swear,

590
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I will just assume that anything anybody's recording

591
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
they're going to publish.

592
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Ah, Jayce.

593
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Ah, boy.

594
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's crazy.

595
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And I'm just bringing to let you know.

596
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, leaving you an audio comment to let you know.

597
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What the missing details are from that

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
mixed-down session that you played in the last

599
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
daily source code.

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What we did was, uh, everyone recording with audacity

601
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
send it all to one person and that one person

602
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that mixes it down.

603
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And, uh, there are only two tricks to it.

604
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
One is, if, uh, anyone's on windows

605
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and recording with audacity,

606
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
there's a little microphone, um,

607
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
slider in the toolbar.

608
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Slide it all the way to the right.

609
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You should have Skype set to tune your audio

610
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
session settings on the fly.

611
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But, um, it's got to range that it'll accept

612
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and your levels in audacity will be way too low

613
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
if you leave the slider where it is.

614
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Drag it as far to the right as you possibly can.

615
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And that will eliminate the need for

616
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
using as much compression as you've heard

617
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
on my voice at least in that, uh, clip.

618
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The other thing is, and you didn't hear this,

619
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
was all of us going 1, 2, 3,

620
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and then all trying to hit the record

621
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
button at the same time.

622
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That makes the job easier for whoever

623
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
it is a has to be, the call

624
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
because that person has to kind of

625
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
tweak the start times of the various

626
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
imported channels so that they can get

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the conversation sounding normal.

628
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That said, um, I can remember who did the mix

629
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
down for that one.

630
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think was Matthew.

631
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And, uh, it was a fantastic job.

632
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You couldn't even really tell that I was in Australia

633
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and there were, um, uh, the United States.

634
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And, uh, I mean, we could hear there was a fair amount of

635
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
lag in the conversation, but it really doesn't

636
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
come out the final product.

637
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I liked that.

638
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Uh, the great news for you and Dave is that

639
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
it really doesn't matter what software

640
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is using or what is encoding radar.

641
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Doesn't matter if he sends you raw, uh, web files

642
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
or MP3s, just along as you can import

643
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
whatever it is that he sends you into whatever

644
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
software it is that you're using the mix

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
down.

646
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now, just happened that I think we were all on

647
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
windows for our call and we were all using

648
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
audacity.

649
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But that was just a coincidence.

650
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And, um, I certainly encoded my session

651
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
to MP3 before I sent it in.

652
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Uh, I don't know whether the others did

653
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and certainly whoever was that mixed

654
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it down, he was using a raw WAV and he had gotten

655
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
to MP3s probably with completely different

656
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
encoding rates from the other two blocks.

657
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So that's PCZ.

658
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Everyone records however they want to record

659
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
as best they can manage their own levels

660
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and everything else.

661
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Send it into one person.

662
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That person imports the resulting sounds

663
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
as separate channels.

664
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Tweaks, you know, you can compress everyone.

665
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
You can tweak the start and finish times.

666
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Cut off the bit at the beginning wherever

667
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I go as one, two, three.

668
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Mix it down and publish.

669
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's that easy.

670
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And, uh, I've got to thank Dawn and Drew

671
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
for, uh, illuminating the technique.

672
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
All we did was give it a shot.

673
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Have a great day.

674
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Bye.

675
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
All right, Garth Perfect.

676
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And also Garth and I talked for quite a while on

677
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Skype.

678
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Um, and was really late for him was like,

679
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
quarter to two in the morning.

680
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And his wife is in the hospital because

681
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
their second child want to come out a couple

682
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
weeks too early.

683
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So, you know, he's kind of floating around

684
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
there.

685
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And I know that feeling.

686
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Um, but we talked about how to use

687
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
show notes of in and out liners or

688
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
opml file.

689
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
How we can incorporate that into the

690
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
iPod or software.

691
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So, I'm really excited about all the stuff

692
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
that's going on.

693
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Um, you know, we're just, we're

694
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
connecting all these bits together.

695
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And users and developers literally are

696
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
partying together.

697
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I know it sounds hokey, but it is.

698
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know, we're working on stuff and getting

699
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
something done.

700
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And we all can be quite proud of

701
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
ourselves.

702
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Time now for our one-minute tip of the day.

703
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Hello and welcome to the one-minute tip.

704
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The place to pick up quick tips to make you

705
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
more computer efficient.

706
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Today's tip and special request for

707
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
keyboard shortcuts in Apple's iChat.

708
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Well, this isn't so much a keyboard shortcut

709
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
just in iChat from Apple.

710
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is also a way to make keyboard shortcuts

711
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
for any application.

712
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This is a great tip.

713
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Go to the Apple pull-down menu and select

714
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
system preferences.

715
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then click on the keyboard and mouse

716
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
component.

717
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Now at the top of this window, push keyboard

718
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
shortcuts.

719
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So now down at the bottom left is a small

720
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
plus sign.

721
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If you push on this plus sign,

722
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
what you can do is you can select

723
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
any application that appears

724
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
basically inside of the Apple environment.

725
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Now type in the menu title just as

726
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
it's displayed in the pull-down menu.

727
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Don't forget the capitals.

728
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And then include the keyboard shortcut

729
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and push the add button.

730
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Make sure you do this when the application

731
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
is closed.

732
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Next time you launch the application,

733
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
this keyboard shortcut will now become available.

734
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Now there's a way to make keyboard shortcuts.

735
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You know, so I actually did learn something

736
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
from that one minute tip.

737
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And I did go, I actually did that.

738
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And what's cool about this is

739
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
even with the shitty interface the iPod has

740
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I could actually scroll back through that tip

741
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
listening to it and do it and follow along

742
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
on my computer and worked out.

743
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I like that.

744
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And because subscribe to the one minute tip

745
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
just by finding that in the iPod.org

746
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I met some,

747
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
actually was re-acquainted with some old friends

748
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
through some iPod or press that

749
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
that's been floating around.

750
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I got an email from

751
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
the Lascivius Bitties,

752
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
specifically from Leanne,

753
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
so hey Adam,

754
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
wonder if you remember the Lascivius Bitties.

755
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I believe Vince Outlaw introduced

756
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
you to us on a San Diego radio show

757
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
a couple of years ago.

758
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Well that's exactly right.

759
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And I remember talking about them

760
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and I can't remember if I played them on the radio.

761
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I definitely blogged about them.

762
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They have a new CD out and they love to send me a copy.

763
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So anyway, so they heard an MPR show

764
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
where I was talking about iPod

765
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and they're really excited.

766
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I wonder what show that was probably

767
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
the WNYC interview.

768
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I've always liked the Lascivius Bitties

769
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
that they're kind of music.

770
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And actually what's cool about is

771
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
the first album that they released

772
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think they've done about four is the one that I have

773
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and they actually provide full length MP3 samples

774
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
on their website.

775
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And it's Bittiesforever.com,

776
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
BIDD IES,

777
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
numeralforever.com.

778
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
All that information in the show notes

779
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
for today's podcast at dailysourcecode.com.

780
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But just listen to a small sample

781
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
of something from the new album,

782
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
which I'll be able to play in full

783
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
of this podcast.

784
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This is a bit of this track called famous.

785
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Listen to this and that and I won't talk about it.

786
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, I will be a Barbie doll with huge fake tits.

787
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
No hips at all.

788
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I hate us attitude.

789
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

790
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Every morning I'll get high on

791
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
colored pills.

792
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Martini's dry.

793
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
A little wing and just a touch.

794
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want to be my famous better than all

795
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
of my fellow watch better than all of her.

796
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I want to be famous slowly and alone at the end.

797
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'll end up bitter and ugly and old.

798
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Not just my body, but also my soul.

799
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But a legend is my goal.

800
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't imagine I'll be when I'm famous.

801
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Not that we don't give for the little people.

802
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
All left is what I'm famous.

803
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm famous.

804
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And it's four girls and they sing these harmonies.

805
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And there's just something, I don't know.

806
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's something sexual about it.

807
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You know, kind of that lounge vibe to it.

808
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And of course, their lyrics are updated.

809
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You know, and I just dig it.

810
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And this is actually, I think, the song that struck me the most.

811
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The first time I heard the list of these videos.

812
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
This is Coney Island.

813
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Something about a minute and a half.

814
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But it's a real good representation of their work.

815
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I love it.

816
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Here's the list of these videos on the daily source.

817
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And those, come from Pennsylvania.

818
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Best from best Virginia.

819
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And dance from Tennessee.

820
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They know me, where they grow me, in Wyoming.

821
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I can't share a new habit.

822
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
They know me, where they grow me, in Wyoming.

823
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I can't share a new habit.

824
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I can't share a new habit as for me.

825
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And it knows, come from middle soda.

826
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Coats come from Dakota.

827
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But why should you be blue?

828
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
For you, you're from Coney Island.

829
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And little Coney Island is famous for you.

830
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
For you, you're from Coney Island.

831
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And little Coney Island is famous for you.

832
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
List of these videos and probably just about half of the Coney Island song.

833
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'll get some more tracks from them up on the source code pretty soon.

834
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And that's it for the final podcast from the castle from Coney Castle.

835
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
We'll now be moving to Coney Cottage.

836
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And overseen us two bad that all of your stuff has to be sent back.

837
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, there's too much stuff so we have to move your room back.

838
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You don't give a shit, do you?

839
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
As long as you have a laptop and your horse.

840
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Alrighty.

841
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Hey, that's it. This is the final podcast from the castle.

842
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Next time we speak, I'll not officially, but we'll pretty much be living in the UK.

843
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Get about a month to dig around before we have to get registered in everything.

844
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
But I don't know if we'll be able to get a podcast up for tomorrow night,

845
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
but you know that I'll be there with y'all in my thoughts.

846
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
My brothers and sisters, put your hands on the iPod and feel the power of the podcast.

847
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
As always, comments are welcome.atomiccurry.com.

848
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Don't expect a response immediately in the next couple of days.

849
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Audio comments are extremely welcome as well.

850
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'll leave a comment on my weblog live.curry.com.

851
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And of course, you can find all the archives and the latest source code on its very on weblog.

852
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Which is dailysourcecode.com.

853
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You can also find the show notes for each show there.

854
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay, so it may be Friday, possibly even Saturday,

855
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and who knows if I'm lucky tomorrow for the next show.

856
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Take care.

857
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So daily source code for Wednesday and November 17th, 2004.

858
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Bye-bye.

859
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Thanks for watching.
