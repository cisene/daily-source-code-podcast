00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Hi everybody, good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, wherever you're checking

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
in from.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I'm Adam Curry coming to you from a rather balmy Belgium.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
It's a power of the door.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
I like the way that sounds. Balmy Belgium.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
And actually just as I said that, the sun's starting to shine through.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,500
We had a beautiful day yesterday, about 26 degrees centigrade,

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
until the very end around 7 o'clock.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
And all of a sudden I knew what was going to happen

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
because our satellite reception went out and I said,

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
oops, we got a real big depression here.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,500
And we just had a cloud burst almost directly above the castle.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,500
And it apparently rained through most of last night.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
So really, and let me start off with this, actually.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I apologize about yesterday not getting a source code up on time,

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
but I'll walk you through just some of the events of the day

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
and then hopefully you'll understand.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
So it's the source code where users and developers party together.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Today we're going to be talking about Howard Stern.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I'll listen to a couple of audio blog posts.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that I've picked up. Also I'm going to give you finally my review of John Stewart's audio

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
book. Look at the iPodder. Oh, I finally I can say this word the iPodder space because

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
now next to iPodder I found there's another company doing something or actually a company

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
not another but a company doing something very similar. I got a song of the day that

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I picked up from from around the net and some quick feedback on Skype. So yesterday

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and I had all the full intentions to do a source code either from the road or once

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I got home but you know because I had to go to Amsterdam sit down with the with

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the bank and financial advisors and some tax lawyers because of our move to the

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
UK there's certain benefits that stem from that financial benefits obviously.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know so it's kind of an important meeting and also you know the bank will

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
help me make that move.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
It's, I just don't, I don't look forward to changing all that stuff.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
What a pain in the ass.

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
So anyway, so hopefully they're going to take care of it for me.

35
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Oh, they will take care of it for me.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
And so I can concentrate on fun things, which was, you know, I wanted to do my

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
source code yesterday.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Didn't work out.

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,500
I drove back after swinging by, uh, swinging by Amsterdam.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Um, I was home around five o'clock, uh, Patricia wanted to eat early.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
So we had dinner.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
And then I got to put together the exercise bike.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Man, talk about developers who make these things and don't really think

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
about users who have to put them together.

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Uh, it took me a little while, but I finally got all the pieces to

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
fit together exactly as they should.

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
And all the pieces were there and it did fit perfectly.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Um, but that took me in, uh, into the good part of the evening.

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
And then I just, uh, you know, I just didn't have the energy left.

50
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Hey, it was Friday.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
What can I say?

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
So I do apologize.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I'll try to do a better job on that.

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Um, as a, um,

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm a former member of the Bridge and Tunnel crowd in New York City.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I really came to appreciate Howard Stern on the radio, on K-Rock.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you sit in traffic for an hour and a half or two hours in front of the Lincoln Tunnel

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
every single morning, then even the best of Sterns start to grow on you.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And I've always really liked the stuff he's doing in the morning.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I feel that particularly, and it's totally a guy's show.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't think it's necessarily intended for women, female listeners at all.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But there's something that I think, and lots of guys like,

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is just giggling about stupid stuff, which of course usually is about farting

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and about sexual stuff.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But it does kind of get you day off started right.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And his audience numbers prove that.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He truly has an amazing audience, very large, and a very valuable audience.

68
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,500
because Howard Stern is without a doubt, no matter what you want to say, very very successful

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
and I happen to like his show.

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:43,500
So I was elated when I read that Howard Stern had struck a deal with movielink.com to distribute

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,500
uncensored versions of his E-Channel television show which is basically his radio show,

72
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
only the cameras are hanging up in the studio.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,500
So they do the radio show, they shoot that with multiple cameras and that's

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,500
aired on each channel so it's a great reappropriation of the content they're already making.

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,500
And obviously lots of stuff that goes on in the Howard Stern studio is censored.

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
So making an uncensored version available over the internet I was like,

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,500
way to go and of course I'll pay 4.95 for the privilege of watching that.

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
So I went to movielink.com, now remember I'm in Belgium and just entering the URL

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
movielink.com brings up the following page that says thanks for your interest in movielink,

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
the leading source for movies del-

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
delivered directly over the internet.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We want you to enjoy our powerful movie download experience, but it is presently unavailable

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to users outside of the United States.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, that blows.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I kind of forgot about it, and then as I was looking through my aggregator, and this is

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
how these things work these days, I have keywords put in there for all kinds of stuff that

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm looking forward to catching.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Once in a while, there is a Howard Stern eShow taped right off the air from the e-channel

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that will come by as a bit torrent in one of the TV torrent RSS feeds.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it's automatically downloaded to my directory where I have all the new stuff that comes

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And lo and behold, someone had taken the movie link video, I presume, and I don't know

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
if they copied it or transcribed it or what they did, or if they just took it verbatim

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
if it's not copied or protected.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't know how movie link works, obviously, so I can't get to the site.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But it downloaded, it was sitting there on my...

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,500
drive for free. And I'm thinking to myself, you know, A, outfits like movielink.com should

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,500
be looking at how they're delivering stuff, because this works, you know, connecting RSS

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,500
with enclosures and BitTorrent. It is actually just kind of working. It's bringing stuff

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,500
to me that I'm interested in. So it's a very, very, very poor man's very primitive

101
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Tivo version of a network Tivo, but it is working. And, you know, and I'd still

102
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
gladly pay if there was a way for me to say, hey, you know, thank you very much. I got

103
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,500
this. I'll pay a subscription, I'll pay whatever, no matter how I receive it. But,

104
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,500
you know, that's up for the business model makers of the future to figure

105
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
out. Of course, the same goes for the iTunes music store, although available

106
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,500
in Germany and the United Kingdom, I believe. And I'm not quite sure how Germany

107
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,500
snuck in there, because the rest of the European Union can't download from the

108
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
iTunes music store.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
store yet. They say that the EU, in the last keynote speech that Apple held in Paris, they

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
said that the EU was coming in, I think, the first half of 2005. But still, these copyright

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
boundaries that are very, very, very complicated legal situations. And we're just routing

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
around it. And I'm not even doing it intentionally. This stuff just floated into me. I didn't

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
go out looking for the Howard Stern e-show uncensored version. It came to me just through

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
technology. So this stuff's tough to pay attention to. And I read something horrible this morning

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that Catherine Zeta-Jones, the beautiful actress who was married to Michael Douglas, that she's

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
shooting a movie in Mexico and that a gang of kidnappers tried to ram her limousine off

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
the road and her bodyguards, which she had, you know, were able to foil the kidnap attempt.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I mean, damn, what's going on there?

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,500
And they say that in the report that I was reading that about 2,000 people a year are abducted

120
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
in this fashion.

121
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Of course, you only really think about it or hear about it when someone of celebrity status

122
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
is abducted or kidnapped.

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
And then it becomes an issue.

124
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
We've got to do something about it.

125
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,500
In the meantime, there's 1,999 other people a year being abducted, which is happening

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
all over the world.

127
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
It's happening in the Middle East.

128
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
It's happening in Iraq.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,500
With the discussions that I had with people over there, it was already a common place

130
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:16,500
at the beginning of, I'm sorry, the First Gulf War when things were just really falling

131
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
to shit in that country.

132
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,500
And sometimes you'd be kidnapped and if the person who was kidnapped, if their family

133
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,500
was influential enough, they could actually scare the kidnappers with all kinds of connections

134
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
and family networks into...

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
giving the person back and actually paying a fine to them.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's crazy what's going on.

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The value of human life is anywhere from zero to a million dollars or more.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's crazy.

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So anyway, we're happy that Catherine Zeta-Jones is okay,

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but man, she's probably going to be a little bit shaken up about that episode for a while

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and I think she has to stay there in Mexico until the shooting for the movie is done,

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which won't be until the end of the year.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay, cruising around the net, listening to some programs, some audio blogs,

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and as you know, my blog digger media subscription, that's the blogdigger.com media feed,

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
brings in, and actually I did look it up, what Blog Digger does

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
is it basically crawls through RSS feeds and I presume that when it either finds a URL,

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
whether it's not entirely clear if it'll take any URL that...

148
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,500
comes across an RSS feed or only ones that are encapsulated as an enclosure, it'll then

149
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,500
bring that in and publish it or publish it into a separate feed.

150
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,500
And so it's all kinds of interesting stuff that comes in and I have a couple of bits

151
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
lined up for you today.

152
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,500
But first I want to take something from Raster Web.

153
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Now we've listened to Raster Web's audio blog post before.

154
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,500
He says something really interesting about how iPodder is working for him and what his

155
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
media client is now turning into.

156
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Let's just listen to this for a second and then we'll discuss it after.

157
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
And the important thing is we're automated.

158
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Can you hear me?

159
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Can you play?

160
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Play what?

161
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
more and more as I'm using my version of the iPod

162
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
that curry calls it, mine's called Braco.

163
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Some pro code I whipped up that I'm seeing iTunes

164
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,500
being more and more like an email application.

165
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I mean, I sort it by, you know, they add it,

166
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
so every time I pull it to the front,

167
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I basically see whatever it's been downloaded

168
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
and stuck into iTunes.

169
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Later I sit down, iTunes comes, I bring iTunes to the front,

170
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
and I go, oh look, there's a new daily source code.

171
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
There's a new evil genius Chronicles or whatever.

172
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
So, kind of cool.

173
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
And again, you know, I see conversations,

174
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,500
which again, great stuff that Ducay and his buddies are doing.

175
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
That's all good stuff.

176
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Okay, so this is interesting.

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,500
When your iTunes or your Windows Media player

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
starts to become an email-like application

179
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
where you look at that and say,

180
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
oh, something new has been added,

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
and think about the interface, at least I've seen it.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
iTunes is very, very similar if not if it probably uses a lot of the same classes, object classes

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
as the male client on Macintosh's OS X. And same goes for Outlook and Windows Media Player,

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sure a lot of the same technology should be leveraged at least underneath the hood.

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I've come to learn that if something new on the Internet looks or feels or works

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
like something that already exists on the Internet, then we've probably got a good

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
thing going because the same things were being said with RSS news readers.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So that's interesting. Even though we're working on getting new types of content

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and bundles of passion and whatever we call it, you know, programs, shows,

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
discussions, interviews, audiobooks, we want to get them directly onto the

191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
mobile devices. Now we're seeing that our media players are becoming kind of

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the database. And of course we're addressing them exactly like that.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
When the iPod or code, when that code runs and it adds something to either the iTunes or the Windows

194
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
media player database. It's actually doing that. It's doing a very informal type of call saying,

195
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,500
add this to that database so you'll be able to search it and find it, retrieve it, etc.

196
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,500
So interesting observation there from Raster Web.

197
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Okay, John Stewart. Since I did do some driving over the past, actually yesterday as I told

198
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,500
you, I had a chance to finish up. The John Stewart presents America Audio Book, which

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
is an excellent, excellent piece of work. It is produced specifically as an audio book.

200
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I don't even know if it's available in a paper version. I don't think a paper version could do it

201
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:15,500
justice. We listen to it. It's put together almost like an old-fashioned radio show with bells

202
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,500
and whistles and sound effects, different voices. Clearly everything is script, but it's...

203
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,500
And of course this edited wasn't done live as they used to do in the old days.

204
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Oh, listen, we've got Pittsburgh on the wireless. But it's an excellent piece of work.

205
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
It takes you through the...

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
history of the United States, how democracy was born and came about.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And of course he does get some historical perspective back to ancient Rome on that.

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And then also explains the three branches of government, goes into all different parts

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and aspects, but in a very humorous way.

210
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And listening to it, having worked with John a little bit in the MTV days when he still

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
had the John Stuart show and we were hanging out at the beach house doing some stuff together.

212
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It really, you can tell it really is John Stuart.

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It is totally from, I'm sure many people worked on this, but it is totally John Stuart to the core.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And here's a little bit where the Congress is being discussed.

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And you listen to this one snippet and I think it will just blow your mind in its humor, its insight.

216
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And it's perhaps its accuracy.

217
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,500
The Strom Thurman filibuster August 28, 1957

218
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Senator Strom Thurman, Republican South Carolina,

219
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
set the record for longest filibuster

220
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
with this 24-hour 18-minute speech

221
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
railing against a civil rights bill.

222
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
The marathon-speaking session left Thurman so drained

223
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
he could barely have sex

224
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,500
with the underaged black woman in his family's employ.

225
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Thurman's oration obliterated

226
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
the previous filibuster record,

227
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
a 13-hour description by Daniel Webster

228
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
of the massive dump he had just taken.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Discussion questions.

230
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
One.

231
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If Khan is the opposite of pro, then isn't Congress the opposite of progress?

232
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Or did we just fucking blow your mind?

233
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I mean, that did blow my mind.

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I was listening to that on the road.

235
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I was like, whoa, progress, Congress.

236
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay, point taken, point made.

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Excellent.

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to play a little bit more of the John Stuart Presents America audiobook

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
in a second.

240
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
First, another bit I picked up online from the blog digger media feed.

241
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Unfortunately, there's no title other than 1933.mp3.

242
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Clearly it's from an audio blogging service.

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's done through a telephone.

244
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And this is a gentleman who is extremely pissed off at George W. Bush.

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And the reason why I want you to hear this, and I'm also going to do something, another

246
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
piece of John Stuart, is as opposed to when you would write about how pissed off you

247
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
are about the current administration or perhaps about anybody, it doesn't really matter.

248
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,500
This is very hard to convey the emotions that you can with the human voice, or at least

249
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,500
to receive the emotions, even though they're probably not even intended to be transmitted

250
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
that way.

251
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
They are transmitted.

252
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:30,500
And this gentleman is definitely angry.

253
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So it's a different world today than it was yesterday because he has now been caught and

254
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
his administration has been caught.

255
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And you know what?

256
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
George Bush's allies have made an issue of John Kerry service and we are going to make

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
an issue of the president's credibility as it relates to his service, to the conduct

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
of what he has done in Iraq, on the issues of his credibility on jobs, healthcare and

259
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
education.

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So this is on the table and it's going to be on the table from now until November 2nd.

261
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
So think about reading that as a web blog post.

262
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
You could certainly receive the same type of intensity

263
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
that you heard there, but probably not.

264
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
And I think this is a definite advantage

265
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
of what audio blogs can do.

266
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
All we need now is different ways for these to be aggregated.

267
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
And I think the most obvious way

268
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
is to have people do that, have people be content routers.

269
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Like what I'm trying to do here

270
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
is let you hear different aspects of what can be done,

271
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
how we can produce things on our desktop,

272
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
how we can distribute them ourselves.

273
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Because I think there is a valid place for audio

274
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
within the internet being a communications device,

275
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
certainly in the manner that we're using it.

276
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
So, and I'll be on the lookout for anything

277
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
that comes from the other side

278
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
of the political equation in the States.

279
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
If that shows up on the blog digger media feed,

280
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I'll be sure to give them equal time.

281
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Back to John Stewart's book, John Stewart Presents America.

282
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Now this is a little longer piece,

283
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
about three and a half minutes, but I think it's...

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well worth listening to first of all I'm trying to entice you to listen to the entire things you can go off to

285
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sure I don't know if Amazon has it. They probably do

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Otherwise audible.com to buy this book

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Prices range from 495 to 795. That's Dave. Dave. Why are paid 495? I paid 795

288
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
this next

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
piece from the book really is the core of what John Stewart and

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We all know him from the Daily Show what he is all about about the media

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What the media's role is in the democracy how it's supposed to function?

292
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And of course we know that John Stewart sees this and the Daily Show

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Really plays off the fact that we don't get what we deserve as a democracy

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What the free press should be delivering to us?

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'll just let me just back this up a second

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And and again you'll hear a very

297
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Passionate John Stewart of course none of this is safe for work, but

298
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
But, you know, we've discussed that before.

299
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Oh, by the way, I'll talk about the copy protection in a second.

300
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
First let's listen to John Stuart.

301
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,500
He says it's about three and a half minutes talking about the media and the free press

302
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
in a democracy.

303
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Chapter 7. The Media. Democracy's Guardian Angel.

304
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
chapter you will learn how to identify political bias in today's liberal

305
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
bleeding heart Jew and gay run media become an unnamed source create your

306
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
own no-spin zone discover which media conglomerate now owns you not have your

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
opinion of Geraldo Rivera particularly improved upon

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
A free and independent press is essential to the health of a functioning democracy.

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It serves to inform the voting public on matters relevant to its well-being.

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why they've stopped doing that is a mystery.

311
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean 300 camera crews outside of courthouse to see what Kobe Bryant is wearing, when the

312
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
judge sets his hearing date while false information used to send our country to war goes unchecked.

313
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What the fuck happened?

314
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The spineless cowards in the press have finally gone too far.

315
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They have violated a trust.

316
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Was the president successful in convincing the country?

317
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Who gives a shit?

318
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Why not tell us if what he said was true and the excuses?

319
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
My god, the excuses!

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hey, we just give the people what they want.

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What can we do?

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This administration is secretive.

323
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But the last season of Friends really is news.

324
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The unmitigated gall of these weak willed.

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're supposed to be helping us, you indecent piles of shit!

326
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I- Fuck it!

327
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Just fuck it!

328
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is the editor again.

329
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We sincerely apologize for this false start.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The authors have assured us it was a momentary lapse.

331
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,500
restrained caused by a deadline-induced red bull binge. In no way was it meant to

332
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
portray any sense of anger and or disappointment in the behavior and

333
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
standards of the modern media.

334
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Chapter 7. The Media. Democracies Guardian Angel.

335
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,500
What's the role of a free and independent press in a democratic society?

336
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Is it to be a passive conduit responsible only for the delivery of information between

337
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
a government and its people?

338
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Is it to aggressively print allegation and rumor independent of accuracy or fairness?

339
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Is it to show boobies?

340
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
No.

341
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,500
The role of a free press is to be the people's eyes and ears, providing not just information

342
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,500
but access, insight, and most importantly, context.

343
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
It must devote its time and resources to monitoring the government, permeating the

344
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,500
halls of power to determine who is doing the people's work, who is corrupting the

345
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
process, and who will promise to be a mole in the State Department if their

346
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
homosexuality is kept secret.

347
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Only after that, and only with time permitting, should it move on to high

348
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
speed freeway cases.

349
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
For government to truly be for the people, inner workings must be exposed for

350
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
the public to see.

351
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
This lofty goal is known as transparency, and while this could be

352
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,500
accomplished by sheathing all elected officials in public buildings in

353
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Saran Wrap, this is

354
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
has been deemed unwieldy, expensive and creepy. Instead transparency is achieved via a free

355
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
press, something so vital to democracy it has historically been given equal stature

356
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
to the three branches of government, hence its nickname, the Fourth Estate.

357
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
No less an authority than Thomas Jefferson wrote,

358
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If it were left to me to decide whether we should have a government without a free

359
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
press or a free press without a government, I would prefer the latter. Now if you'll

360
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
excuse me, I have a lunchtime appointment with a fine slice of brown sugar.

361
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So the audiobook is titled John Stewart Presents America and well worth the

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
three and a half hours that you'll be listening to it. Excellent, excellent

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
stuff and actually a very good refresher course in in what this great country is

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
all about. And oh yeah, something about a little bit about DRM and copy

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
protection. Of course I purchased the book off of audible.com. It downloads

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
as an Apple AAC file which has the advantage of bookmarking.

367
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
which work automatically with your iPod, but also should include

368
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And instead of, since I can't really queue anything up in iTunes, except for like one bookmark,

369
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I wanted to play two different clips.

370
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What I did was I recorded it through wiretap, which is a beautiful little application for the Mac OS X, OS X 10.

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I just played the bits that I wanted, recorded them, which are then recorded as AIFF files,

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and just opened those in QuickTime.

373
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And it worked perfectly, so much for the big DRM and impossibility of copying.

374
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Not of course that I want to encourage any of you to do that, but it's that simple,

375
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and they really want to stop copying copyright protected works.

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We've got to find a device of different schema.

377
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay, let's talk about iPod, or just briefly, of course,

378
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
iPod.org is where you can download one of many different applications and scripts

379
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that will enable you to automatically download programs like this one onto your mobile device.

380
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We have it set up for iPods, we have it set up for...

381
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,500
anything that works with Windows Media Player and even have a version for Linux.

382
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
That'll at least bring everything in for you.

383
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:05,500
And someone, a couple people actually pointed me to a company called Audio Feast.

384
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Let me just bring this up now.

385
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Here we go, Audio Feast, which you can find at

386
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,500
serenadesms.com, so S-E-R-E-N-A-D-E-S-M-S.com

387
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Audio Feast, I'll just read this to you, delivers 300 plus news, sports and entertainment radio programs to your MP3 player and PC.

388
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Sync all the programs you want, listen whenever and wherever you'd like.

389
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,500
So essentially they have exactly the same idea.

390
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:46,500
In fact, when I go to the What Is It page, which I'll surf to now and I'll read along with you,

391
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Audio Feast is a service that delivers extensive programming choices for MP3 players.

392
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
It's easy to use and deliver time shifting.

393
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
flexibility at an affordable all you can listen prize. Subscribers can choose to listen

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
to their favorite programs directly from their desktop or sync to their portable audio devices

395
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and listen on the go. So it is exactly what we're doing here only I think these guys

396
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
have it completely backwards and upside down. What they're doing is they've created

397
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
another gateway, they're gatekeepers to getting stuff onto your mobile device and

398
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that's what you pay for. You basically pay for their technology to work on your

399
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
system whereas we've created you know little scripts some fewer than a hundred

400
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
lines long which do exactly the same thing. Now here's the here's what I

401
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
really don't understand and these guys are funded they have VCs on the board

402
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
so they've got money. They have providers so you can become a

403
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
provider which means you probably pay a license to use their technology to

404
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
get onto their distribution system and they have here as providers A&E

405
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,500
AARP, Animal Talk Radio, BBC, Beatles Arama, Blue, Bloomberg, Cape Cod Radio, Consumer

406
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Reports, C-SPAN, Discovery Channel, Dow Jones, Fox, Grateful Dead, John Hopkins.

407
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,500
They've got some smaller providers in there as well, but the fact that you have to become

408
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
a provider and register with them just makes no sense to me.

409
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
We already have this technology available at our fingertips and it's working now and

410
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
it's free.

411
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,500
All you have to do is work out your own copyright issues.

412
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,500
So although I applaud them for what they're doing and for the thought behind it,

413
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,500
it just doesn't make any sense to me because we're doing exactly what Audio

414
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Feast is offering here.

415
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Only we're using the existing technology.

416
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,500
You know, I don't think we should be locked into anything that gives them

417
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
power over access to whatever we want to have.

418
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Also, I don't want to have to pay anyone more than my provider for

419
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
whatever bandwidth I use to publish something.

420
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,500
But I linked to this on my weblog at curate.com, so check it out.

421
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And if anyone actually decides to sign up, subscribe and use it,

422
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we'd love to have a review and see if there's anything that we can use in our own system.

423
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Okay, time for our song of the day. Already 30 minutes into this,

424
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
so I have a few more things I want to talk about after the song of the day,

425
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
which will be about iPhoto and about Skype.

426
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And this one came in through the Blog Digger Media Feed.

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's a classic song from the 80s.

428
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I wouldn't have chosen this one if it hadn't come in automatically,

429
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
but I've decided to try and do as many sounds around the net as possible.

430
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,500
I don't know if they're doing another reunion so I can do it about once every year.

431
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,500
I won't make the love of you, baby

432
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,500
You won't make the love of me

433
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Baby, I can't make the love of you, baby

434
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Then you can't love me tonight

435
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
you

436
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Kiss! I was made for loving you. I think that was 1979. Maybe the right time now to tell

437
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:45,000
my one of my kiss stories. I was working at MTV. Let's see, this was 1987 or 1988 at

438
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
the time I believe. And I was one of the, actually I was the only air talent as they

439
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
called it, who wanted to sit in the music meetings which is basically where we

440
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
decided what we're gonna play and what rotation videos are gonna be played. Very

441
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
much in fact it was run exactly like a radio station certainly in those days

442
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
using the same type of music scheduling software and there were radio

443
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
people who were basically doing the programming lineup. Of course this was

444
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
MTV played videos right and we had our music meeting I want to say it was

445
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Tuesdays and Kiss had a video out. God I can't remember what it was now but we were

446
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
all sitting in the music meeting.

447
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,500
and all of a sudden the door bursts open and in comes Gene Simmons

448
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
and he's got knee pads on

449
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,500
and he jumps up onto this big conference room table

450
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
and we're all sitting around it right being really serious

451
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,500
picking the music videos deciding whose career we're going to make or break

452
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,500
and he hops up and he goes over to Abbie Konowicz

453
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,500
who later went on to co-found Madonna's record label Maverick

454
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:01,500
and he's on all fours and he's right in front of Abbie Konowicz

455
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,500
and says alright who do I have to blow around here to get this video played

456
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,500
hilarity ensued and of course the video was added goes without saying

457
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,500
so to wind up things for today's source code

458
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,500
I want to thank everyone for the feedback I've received on Skype

459
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:27,500
so no Skype and SIP, those are two different protocols used for voiceover IP

460
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
they're also not compatible with each other, at least not yet

461
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
can't talk to each other. There's no super advantage behind using Skype versus some of

462
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:46,000
the other VoVIP systems from what I gather. Other than that it does just seem to work,

463
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
which is exactly what they advertised. You can't get any inbound service, that I already

464
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
knew. They have the Skype out, which I'm fairly happy with, works very well. Because

465
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
the peer-to-peer nature of how they do things, it is suggested in some cases, although

466
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I haven't witnessed it personally, that there can be a lot of latency in the

467
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
phone calls. And also so far no one has really been able to give me any solution

468
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
for what I'm looking for, which is a voice over IP provider that will let

469
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
me use a software phone as well as a voice over IP hardware to connect my

470
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
analog phone. And I want a local dial-up number in Los Angeles, in New York, in

471
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Amsterdam, in Antwerp, and in London.

472
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,500
That's what I want and I'm willing to pay for it. So please, if you're working on a service,

473
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:44,500
just keep my wishes in mind, will you? And the largest advantage that Skype has over all the

474
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,500
voice over IP setups that I've come to understand is that they have the firewall issue solved.

475
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,500
And of course, they were able to solve this because they're using their kaza technology.

476
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,500
It's made by the same guys who created kaza. And they had the firewall issues all sorted

477
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,500
out there. So that's the number one thing that Skype is really good at.

478
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,500
And to wrap it up for today, I wanted to talk about iPhoto. Don't know if you recall that I was

479
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,500
really running out of disk space. I was continuously deleting stuff from caches.

480
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,500
We all know the drill, right? You go searching for files larger than 5 megs.

481
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,500
What can I do with this? And either way to move some stuff off. And the two largest

482
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,500
collections of data that I have, excuse me, are without a doubt my music folder.

483
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and my pictures folder. And the decision about music was pretty easy because I really need

484
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
access to that at a moment's notice on my hard drive for the type of work that I'm producing

485
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
like the source code. So I've been cleaning up my iTunes library as I go, you know, just

486
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
pulling out old shit, old audiobooks that I don't need anymore, which are huge files.

487
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You know, we're talking 80 megs for some of them, and that's just, you know, in

488
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
three different parts. So I've been able to find a lot of space there, but the pictures,

489
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
which is all in the iPhoto album folder, that was about six gigs. No, a little less,

490
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm sorry, about four and a half gigs. And I knew that, you know, if I could move those

491
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
off, at least if I have them on some kind of safe storage device, I know that I'll be

492
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
able to use them later on. I wasn't too sure how easy that was going to be, but I

493
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
just wanted to say that with iPhoto it's really phenomenal. Now I'd never used the DVD

494
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
burning capabilities of my power book. So I didn't know, you know, I was total newbie at

495
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
this and went to...

496
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,500
the store and of course promptly bought the wrong DVDs there is a difference between plus R or plus

497
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:46,500
RW and minus R or minus RW for two different technologies of how the DVDs are burned and if

498
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,500
you you know do it incorrectly then they won't play on different machines and God knows what.

499
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
So I went back same place by the way where we bought the exercise bike.

500
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:06,500
It's a great store and I got the minus RW because I can actually use optical discs that are

501
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:12,500
rewritable. Now this was pretty cool I've never erased a DVD and I actually practiced with that and

502
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,500
it worked and worked perfectly and so then in iPhoto there's a little button you just select all your

503
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,500
pictures and I couldn't get all of them onto one DVD because it would it just it would take up

504
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:29,500
too much space and I guess it's 4.7 gigs that fit onto a DVD and with some overhead I couldn't quite

505
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:35,500
get everything on there from 1999 to 2004 to date so I split it up into 99 through 2003.

506
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
three, just click the burn button out to select those pictures.

507
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Actually, I made a little smart playlist that says, you know, select all photos between these

508
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
two dates.

509
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Burn that to DVD, popped it out, did the other one for 2004.

510
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And of course, I checked and made sure everything was working.

511
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I had a whole backup copy on a firewire drive before I deleted the iTunes, the picture,

512
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
the iPhoto library references.

513
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And what's cool about it is now when I insert one of those two DVDs, it automatically fires

514
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
up iTunes and presents me with the pictures exactly the way they were when they were on

515
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
my hard drive.

516
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And the speed between getting them off the DVD and the hard drive is slower, but it's

517
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
certainly manageable and I can whip up a slideshow and all the albums are still intact.

518
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So that is absolutely well done, very happy.

519
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And again, I think that sometimes those guys at Apple, man, they're probably smoking

520
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the same stuff that we are here down on Earth.

521
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And that's it for source code for today.

522
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We'll be back on Monday.

523
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,500
