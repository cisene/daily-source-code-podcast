1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How are you all doing?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Friends, family, global dominating world leaders. Welcome to the daily source code. I'm Adam Curry.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Coming to you from Amsterdam, the Netherlands today, from the bunker on the canal.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, thank God, it's Monday, huh?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Because Monday always reminds you that there's a whole new week of fascinating stuff up ahead.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's so much that can be happening, that will be happening.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And there's a lot to talk about that did happen.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or maybe a little more specifically, some stuff that didn't happen.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you were somewhat annoyed or disappointed that there was no source code Friday or Friday night,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or there's nothing sitting there waiting for you on Saturday.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You were probably waiting for the helicopter flight addition of the daily source code.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, I'll guess what, it didn't happen. I'll explain why.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Because the root of the theme song here for a second, I'm tired of that.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
First of all, so yeah, Patricia and I are in Amsterdam today.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She's at the dentist, finally finishing up all the rather nasty dental works.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She's had in the past couple of years. So everything's great, and she's happy to be done.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And so I had time here to finish up a couple things.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And we're still winding down just about everything we can here, so that when we leave,

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which would be around the end of November when we moved to the UK, everything will be pretty much done.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Unfortunately, I still have this humongous house in Amsterdam, which, well, the housing market right now is just not good.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
People who live in the Netherlands are not really buying houses, so clearly a lot aren't selling,

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and it's hard to find the right people folks coming over from other countries looking for something like this.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is a big place.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Anyway, thinking of things to do with that.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But back to Friday and Saturday, what the plan was,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've been asked to be a celebrity waiter at a special benefit dinner for war child.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Feast for peace is what it was called.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And there were several other Dutch celebrities there, and it actually was a lot of hard work,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
about 200 people that had to be served.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Part of them were on a buffet, some others on a set menu,

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
but I used to waiter in a rather classy restaurant in Audeca,

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
called The Old Prince, The Out of Prince.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I wore the three-piece suit and the bow tie, and really worked my ass off when I was like 17.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And even a little bit younger than even 16 is when I started there.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I did that for about three years, so I definitely know how to do it,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and I know how it works, and know how it restaurant runs.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was a little on handy as they had two floors, and the kitchen was on the top floor,

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
so anything that was delivered downstairs had to be taken down by the stairs,

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and the dirty plates had to be taken up, so that was kind of a bummer.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But I'd promised to do this.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It was about 200 kilometers, so let's say about 110 miles from my house,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
each way.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I knew it was going to be really late by the time we were done.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I said to the organizers, who I knew to friends of mine, I said,

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll tell you what, I'm going to fly to your house,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
which is nearby.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's their restaurant nearby the restaurant.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then I'll pick you up.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We'll fly to the restaurant.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then we'll do our thing.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We'll leave the helicopter there, and then the next morning,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you just take me over to the restaurant, and I'll fly back home.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the plan was, since I was going to be up on myself,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
was to hook up the recording equipment.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've done this before.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It works perfectly.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have the wireless mic set, and I just put the little lovelier mic

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
inside my headphone, because when I talk through the microphone

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
on the headset, you'll hear me through the inner-com system,

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and you'll also hear what's going on with air traffic control.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now, on, I left late, so Friday afternoon,

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
this is funny.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
All the air bases, all the air force bases in the Netherlands,

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
they're always closed.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or they'd closed early on Fridays.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They're closed all weekend.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a perfect time to attack Holland if you're planning

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
a stealth attack, because they just closed.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's no one there.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Literally, no one there.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So there's also no air traffic control,

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and around each of these, the basically airports,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
so these bases, there's a control zone that can reach

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
several miles wide, and you have to request a crossing.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Usually, you ask them, the air traffic control

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
around the ground, and these control zones.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So, they've not being there.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You have to talk to Dutch military info.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And Dutch military info is kind of the default

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that you go back to, if you can't reach somebody,

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
or if you want to know something about a certain area,

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that's their flight information service.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And it was so beautiful.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The weather was just so phenomenal that everybody

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and their freaking dog was in the air.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I swear to God, excuse me.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're right, math.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There are days that go by when I don't hear a single soul

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
on the radio.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's no one in the air, but me and KLM basically,

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and they're 30,000 feet higher than I am.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And today, everybody was up.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There were gliders.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There were ultra lides.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There were lots of fixed wing aircraft.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There were some helicopters.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Everything was flying around.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And since I couldn't just listen to the specific frequency

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that I needed in a new one of these air bases,

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I had to listen to Dutch mil info.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it was so busy.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I really wanted to pay attention because,

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you got people zooming around at a thousand feet,

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
which is about my height.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's where I usually fly.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sometimes a bit lower.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
700 feet is what helicopters like to fly.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But there's people all over the place.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Especially gliders.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And there's only one air traffic controller

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
controlling all of these areas.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And so either I would have to turn the sound down,

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
which would be unsafe to say the least,

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
because you definitely want to hear what's going on.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And just where everybody is,

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
as you can get a little global picture of what's happening.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Or you would be distracted by it because,

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and I would be distracted by it and couldn't talk.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So Friday was bad.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Of course, the weather Saturday was even better.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All the control zones were closed.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everybody was out again.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I just decided not to do it,

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
because it would either be unsafe,

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
or just I don't think it would be that entertaining.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I owe you that one,

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and we'll definitely do it,

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
because I think it's cool.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think you'll enjoy flying along,

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and just listening what's happening,

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and I'll talk you through some of the stuff I'm doing,

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and we can just talk about stuff.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So for today,

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I figured I'd try and make a little bit good,

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and kick it off with a nice song for this Monday,

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
which is a promise for the future.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, blue eyes on the daily source code.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's about aviation.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
To blue.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In Lama Land,

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
there's a one-man band,

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and it'll tutt his flute for you.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Come fly with me,

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
let's take off in the blue.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Once I get you up there,

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
where the air is where I find,

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we'll just fly.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Star.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Once I get you up there,

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll be holding you a song.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You made it.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Angels tear,

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
cause we're together.

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Where the wise,

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it's such a lovely day.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Just say the words,

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and we'll beat the birds down to act.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A book obey.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's perfect for flying.

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Honeymoon,

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
they sell.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Come fly with me,

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
let's fly, let's fly away.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Once I get you up there,

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
where the air is where I find,

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we'll just fly.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Star.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Once I get you up there,

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll be holding you a song.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You made it.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Angels tear,

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
cause we're together.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where the wise,

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it's such a lovely day.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You just say the words,

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and we'll beat the birds down to act.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
A book obey.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's perfect for flying.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Honeymoon,

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
they sell.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Come fly with me,

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
let's fly, let's fly.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Pack up, let's fly away.

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I believe with Nelson Riddle.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Frank Sinatra,

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
come fly with me.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We're just kind of how I feel about what we're doing with iPod.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're all just flying along here,

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and everyone's allowed to jump on and fly along.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's extremely nice.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So we were talking,

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know how long ago it was,

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
but we've been talking often on about

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
the genre setting in these podcasts.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you have an MP3 player,

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you look at it,

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
there's different categories that you can put your

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
music into,

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and of course there's all kinds of music genres,

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and there's a speech genre,

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and a talk genre I believe,

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and maybe there's,

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't even think there's an audiobook genre.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is according to ID3 tags,

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
1.3 or 2.1,

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
or I'm not quite sure.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I've been able to force a podcasting genre

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
into the daily source code,

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
so that it's encoding,

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and I guess everyone else can see that in their MP3 players,

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and their iPods,

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that it's coming across as a podcast.

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I've been doing this after an audio comment that came in

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
from Michael Gogan,

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've already been pronouncing his name.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank God he doesn't for us.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey Adam, it's Michael Gogan.

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There we go.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Go Hagen.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, here's some feedback from Michael Gogan.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
As a follow-up to my suggestion yesterday that everybody

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
begins setting genre as podcast,

226
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
as they're sending out their podcast,

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it appears that there is absolutely no rules about

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
what should or should not be listed as a genre.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I say let's make the platform ours,

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and start listening to everybody's genre as podcast.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You know, the side benefit of that is

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that if you were to pass along one of these recordings to a friend,

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or somebody that's not even familiar with this entire format yet,

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
just by pulling up the name and title in genre,

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
they'd see what they've got and go out in the internet

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and find out all about it.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You know, as we begin aggregating more and more of these things,

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
for those of us that are interested in keeping it,

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
you know, that metadata is going to become important.

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I know it really helps me to have a consistent setting

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
in iTunes because I've just got thousands of songs,

242
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and this helps to segregate it from actual speech recordings

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
or audiobooks and that sort of thing.

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So I was really pleased to see that you had implemented

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
podcast yesterday.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I know that Matthew Bischoff did so as well,

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and so it's kind of neat to see some hair-brained idea

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I had implemented just a day later.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
On the window side it appears that sometimes genre

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is referred to as content.

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It should be easy enough to change if you're a particular

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
editor, a recorder doesn't allow you to do it on the window side.

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There are plenty of ID3 tag editors you can download

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
or worst case scenario.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Just pull down iTunes that's free anyways,

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and it makes it really easy to change.

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, just on a side note,

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
right after my email yesterday,

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
you played a little recording from Dave Slescher's

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Evil Genius Chronicles.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It was actually a recording I had sent in to Dave

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
a day or two prior, so you made my Wednesday.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I felt like I hit a home run.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I ended up both on Dave's show and on your show.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So maybe I've invented the first subset of podcasting,

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
which is just recording a two or three comment,

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
two or three minute comment, submitting it,

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and seeing who plays it,

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
almost like a correspondence.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So anyways, keep up the good work,

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and I look forward to listening to your show.

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Alright, thank you very much, Michael.

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That was well worth listening to.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When I do encourage that,

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
please send in your audio comp.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's good, it's a nice way to communicate in these podcasts.

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Certainly for the Daily Source Code,

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
coming to you today, as said, from Amsterdam,

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and the iPod or hype seems to be at just climbing to higher peaks

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
every single day.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I've been doing interviews more over the weekend,

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
wired magazine, wired came out with a real nice article.

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Haven't seen the L.A. Times yet, but that's on the way.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've been doing interviews more over the weekend,

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
wired magazine, wired came out with a real nice article.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Haven't seen the L.A. Times yet, but that's on the way.

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Last night, the BBC interviewed me.

288
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was so cool to, I'm still looking for a recording.

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
They promised they would email me the piece when it was broadcast.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because the BBC has so much good content,

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
so we got a little bit into that.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I hope it was pre-recorded, so I hope they left it

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in the actual interview that aired.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Also, I was on with Leo L.A.

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The beginning of the weekend,

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
tech guy on KFI, Leo now has two podcasts going.

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So check them out at LeoVille.com.

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can hear the part to the interview there,

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but he's also doing a news podcast,

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
which is a little more regular.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So be sure to check out LeoVille.com.

302
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I've been working on the directory at ipotter.org.

303
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The traffic that we're getting is just,

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
it's unbelievable. I'm really happy we moved this to,

305
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
a new server before all this started to just

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
unleash itself upon this server running ipotter.org.

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The concept behind the directory,

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and I'm really starting to understand the beauty

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
of decentralized directories right now.

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A directory is just like Yahoo has,

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
where you can look at businesses by region,

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
by town, type of business.

313
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In this case, looking at podcasts,

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
it's exactly the same thing.

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Only, of course, this is going so fast.

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I already have so many entries in the directory tree

317
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that it's impossible for one person just to maintain.

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Nor do I want to do that.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Nor should there be any central person

320
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that has that type of power.

321
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's a concern,

322
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because we want to make it as open as possible for everybody.

323
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So this concept of the open directory,

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
really eliminates that.

325
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Here's how it works.

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Basically, you create the directory in an outliner.

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That makes sense, right?

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You've seen an outliner.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You can expand a node, so you might have music

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
underneath there.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It would be blues and rock,

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and then maybe world music.

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You expand that.

334
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There may be some more subcategories,

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
like for blues.

336
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It could be rhythm and blues and delta blues.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And underneath that, you eventually find the links

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
that you're looking for.

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Now, you translate that to the web,

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and you get a directory structure where you have

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
a breadcrum trail of basically directories that you

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
jump into until you get where you want to be,

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and then you can trace your way back.

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So you create these in OPML, which stands for Outline

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Process or Markup Language.

346
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's like HTML for Outliners.

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I've linked on us as iPodder as well as

348
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Curry.com.

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've linked to OPML or Outline program

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
programs that export OPML.

351
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I basically have created a number of top categories.

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's just a start, right?

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Because we can have any number we want,

354
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and any way we want to categorize it.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But the way this works is other people

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
should own trees and branches or, you know,

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and nodes of this directory.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So already I'm working with two people.

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
One is already taken hold of the music directory.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And that means that anything,

361
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
when the minute you, in an iPodder or the minute

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you click on the music folder,

363
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it looks like it's still staying on iPodder.org,

364
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
but it's actually bringing in the OPML

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
from a public web server and it's giving you a seamless

366
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
overview of and breadcrum trail

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
through the directory structure.

368
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And in addition to that,

369
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
if you want to suggest add a link,

370
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
it goes to the owner of that branch

371
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and to that owner's email.

372
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So that's all automatic.

373
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's really cool.

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's far from done because I'd love to have

375
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
or there's so many more, so many things I could go for a whole show

376
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that's what I'd like to have in the directory.

377
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But what's cool is already the music directory

378
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
is now being maintained by someone else.

379
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And once I get another person ready,

380
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
who's already got everything good to go,

381
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but his OPML is still a little funky.

382
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So we're working on that.

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Then there's going to be a sub division,

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
specifically for mixes,

385
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that'll be made by someone else.

386
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So you can see how this directory can build

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
very, very quickly.

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So I'm looking for people who want to help.

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you can figure out how to create an OPML document,

390
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
which in essence, you can create it just like RSS.

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You could probably write it by hand.

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You know, it's not that hard.

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But it's a little bit easier.

394
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And it's more visual if you do it in an outliner.

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Personally, I use radio user land.

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It supports all of the bits we need out of the box.

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It is fully OPML compliant.

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And well, there's a drawback,

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
if you call it that it does cost money.

400
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You do have to pay for it.

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can use it for up to 30 days to test it out.

402
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And then you have to pay 40 bucks and you get some hosting

403
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and a weblog and all that.

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But I think the outliner is at this point,

405
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
the most important thing to talk about in radio user land.

406
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A lot of people who have started helping out using

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Omni Outliner, small drawback,

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the minute you export to OPML in Omni Outliner,

409
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it does not send the owner name element.

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Or it doesn't create the owner name element or the owner email element,

411
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
both which you need in order to work with the directory.

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It also doesn't have a created element

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and a modified date stamp element.

414
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And some other things like node states,

415
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but that's less important.

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But hopefully we can get some of those

417
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
incompatibility squared away.

418
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm getting a delay on headphones here.

419
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It sounds like I'm talking with a big rubber ball on my mouth.

420
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Which could have been true, but not today.

421
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay, let's see.

422
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What do we do?

423
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh man, 20 minutes into the show.

424
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Talk about the directory.

425
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Now I want to talk a little bit about the election.

426
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
As I've been cruising through the internet,

427
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
just finding all the cool bits,

428
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
subscribing to new podcasts.

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm using iPod RX.

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It has an option to download the files,

431
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
other than MP3s.

432
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And I've subscribed to the blog digger,

433
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
media feed and feedsters, AVI feed.

434
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So I get all these cool little video mixes of stuff,

435
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
which is usually all anti-bush,

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
or very pro-carry.

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Certainly those are just the two categories.

438
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You could put everything into.

439
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And there's some, it looks like there's some movies

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
or documentaries coming out and there's lots of trailers.

441
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I did a little test and I listened to each of these

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
without looking at the video,

443
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
just listening on the headphones.

444
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I thought they were good enough to put on the source code,

445
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
because there's just some,

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
well, there's interesting angles and interesting takes.

447
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And this is the time to display this art before the election.

448
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
After the election,

449
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
it won't make any,

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
it really that much sense.

451
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So I think it's important that we,

452
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that we get the stuff out there,

453
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
so you can hear it.

454
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm going to start with a bit,

455
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
which is about Fox News Channel.

456
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Often, of course,

457
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
if you're into conspiracy theories,

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you're going to love this.

459
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Fox News Channel is said to be,

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
a supporter of Bush,

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
totally hammering Kerry,

462
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but also just any Democrat versus Republican.

463
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And Roger Ailes is the guy,

464
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I think, still runs Fox News Channel.

465
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And the question that was asked in this,

466
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I believe trailer for documentaries,

467
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
who is the guy that runs Fox News Channel?

468
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Who runs Fox News Channel?

469
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In 1967, Roger Ailes works as media manager

470
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
for a public and presidential candidate, Richard Nixon.

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In 1984, Roger Ailes is hired as a media advisor

472
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
for the Reagan campaign.

473
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
In 1988, Roger Ailes works as the media manager

474
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
for a public and candidate, George H. W. Bush.

475
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It is accused of master-minding

476
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
a DuCoccus race-bading campaign

477
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
using convicted murder of Willie Horton.

478
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
After a career of running cutthroat conservative media campaigns,

479
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
for three Republican presidents,

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Roger Ailes launches the Fox News Channel in 1996.

481
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We'd like to restore objectivity,

482
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
where we find it lacking,

483
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and I left politics a number of years ago

484
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and run on whose organization for the last two years.

485
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So we just expect to do fine,

486
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
balanced journalist.

487
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
On election night of 2000,

488
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Roger Ailes Fox News Channel prematurely announced

489
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to the world that George W. Bush

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
had won the state of Florida.

491
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
President Bush's days of absorbing John Kerry's attacks

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
were without counterattack or over.

493
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
John Kerry has been lashing out at President Bush

494
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and by extension Republicans for a long time.

495
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But the president is a gentleman.

496
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You know, he set a different tone for his campaign.

497
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
John Kerry was scaring old people as usual.

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The guy who says what he means of means what he says.

499
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
North Korea loves John Kerry.

500
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Really? Yeah.

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's John Kerry's Jane Farnder with the Burmary Stark.

502
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Dr. Rodgersman.

503
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He wanted to do this Kerry plan.

504
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We'll do his punished, successful companies.

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Elias worked well for Democrats in the past.

506
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I think the market is down on John Kerry.

507
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The economy is very, very strong right now.

508
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I think it's going to get stronger.

509
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's picking up.

510
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Day by day.

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Killing more jobs.

512
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm going to suggest to the budgetary for John Kerry.

513
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
In 2004, Roger Ailes is running yet another Republican media campaign.

514
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This time, he's got an entire table

515
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that worked to help him re-elect George W. Bush.

516
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Move on.org.

517
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's who put that out there.

518
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Definitely an interesting site worth checking out.

519
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Although I had to say, I'm on the mailing list and I rarely ever read it.

520
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But I like what they produce.

521
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I think they produce really wonderful stuff.

522
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Very powerful stuff.

523
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Good video.

524
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

525
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Now onto something about the...

526
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What was an SMS coming in?

527
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
About the Patriot Act.

528
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Another trailer for unconstitutional...

529
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The film was called Unconstitutional.

530
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And you can find more information at unconstitutionalthemovie.org.

531
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let me just see if I have the right one here.

532
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Pretty sure I do.

533
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Now, this is coming off another media play.

534
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This is coming off of the VLC client.

535
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So hopefully it'll play and you'll be able to hear it.

536
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Here's the trailer for Unconstitutional.

537
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This legislation is essential not only to pursuing and punishing tourists.

538
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But also preventing more atrocities.

539
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
For about 20 second, I've got a phone call about 7 o'clock in the morning.

540
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
For my uncle saying that by 12 to 15 federal agents

541
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
just came into my pants house, picked up my mom, my dad, and my sister.

542
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I go sat down next to me and I said,

543
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
George Bush is out of control.

544
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I would gasp probably 30 minutes later.

545
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Over my shoulder and there were four Santa Fe police officers standing behind me.

546
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
We have to ask ourselves, is this the most effective use of law enforcement?

547
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Power.

548
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Nearly 1,000 individuals.

549
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
He swept broadly, he swept blindly.

550
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Until the number was over 1,000,

551
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and people started asking questions.

552
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
They said, how many of these 1,000 people have been charged with

553
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the crimes of September 11th and the answer was zero.

554
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I know my dad was so hard to come to the country for freedom.

555
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And then you know, 10 years later, we find out that the country that we came here to save us

556
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
is actually doing the Santas.

557
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You had the Justice Department itself criticizing the actions and the policies.

558
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
These are critical issues.

559
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is what we're fighting for.

560
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
These are our civil liberties.

561
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Well, I mean, I'm the was we'd say.

562
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And have that drink open, I know.

563
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm talking sex, I'm living real for.

564
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm moving.

565
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay, this is here.

566
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's sponsored by ACLU, unconstitutional, unconstitutional,

567
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the movie.org.

568
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You can probably tell by now that this, if you're a Republican,

569
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
this may not be a good podcast to listen to today.

570
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And there's more where that came from.

571
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I got an interesting audio feedback from Alan Pine,

572
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Alan's from Paris, and he has a very cool podcast.

573
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, I'll let him explain exactly what it is and where you can find it.

574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Hey Adam, this is Alan Pine calling from Paris and France.

575
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I just wanted to let you know about a great site called truthout.org.

576
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And in particular, there are nightly truthout overview, MP3 bulletin,

577
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
which is presented by William Rivers Pit.

578
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's basically a five to six minute news,

579
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
style bulletin of credible journalistic coverage of the US

580
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and US foreign policy, the political situation, et cetera, et cetera.

581
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The only downside is that at the moment,

582
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
they don't have any RSS feed, nor any enclosures.

583
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So what I've done in the meantime is to handle the feed,

584
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and pointing to their archives.

585
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And it's available on my blog, which is at

586
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Perso.1ado.fr-72% water.

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's P-R-S-O-Person.1ado.fr-72% water.

588
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Hope this is useful for you.

589
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Keep up the great work, your seven-dave, and

590
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Viva La Revolucione.

591
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Take care, bye.

592
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Right home, Viva La Revolucione!

593
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I love it, thank you very much, Alan,

594
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and I have subscribed to the show,

595
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and I got to say it is very good.

596
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I wonder if this actually airs anywhere.

597
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It sounds very much like a podcast.

598
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's very well written and well read,

599
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
but it doesn't sound like it's,

600
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
it doesn't have quite that professional radio quality.

601
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So please let us know exactly what,

602
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
where this is being broadcast or,

603
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
is it always at web only?

604
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And since you already publicly announced it

605
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
in the feedback, I will place a link

606
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
to the podcast feed for truth out.

607
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's definitely some good stuff.

608
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Okay, another trailer, this is a funny trailer,

609
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
about the weird speech that our current president

610
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
often produces.

611
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Also included in this at the end,

612
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
is an entire song by the George W. Burst Singers.

613
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present for you

614
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
on the source code, Bushisms.

615
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Africa is a nation of suffers from incredible disease.

616
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, I think it might have been better to say

617
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
that there are a lot of people in Africa

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
who suffer from terrible diseases,

619
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
as opposed to making it sound like

620
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
the whole continent.

621
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
She's got to be cut off and sunk.

622
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I think war is a dangerous place.

623
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
War, what is it good for?

624
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A three day weekend.

625
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It'll take time to restore chaos.

626
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I think that they brought chaos to Iraq promptly,

627
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and he thought it would be a challenge in fact

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
that proved to be very simple.

629
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I kept you imagine something like

630
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
someone been more than ever saying

631
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the George W. Burst Singers.

632
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We're knowing the simple pleasure

633
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
finding an egg on Easter Sunday.

634
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, someone been law night filled the same way.

635
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
He misses out on Hanukkah,

636
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yom Kippur,

637
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Russia-China,

638
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and the United States.

639
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He misses out on Hanukkah,

640
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
the John Kippur,

641
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Russia-China.

642
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
He just doesn't appreciate the joy

643
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
of the George Holidays.

644
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I can't imagine Osama in

645
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Joing Spring Break.

646
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It can come.

647
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's almost like this Osama

648
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
bin Laden, Pella,

649
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
is from somewhere else,

650
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
from some other culture.

651
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's weird.

652
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And interact.

653
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We entered the rule of one of

654
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
the worst tyrants.

655
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And in so doing,

656
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
we'd not only freed the American people,

657
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we made our own people more secure.

658
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And there's no doubt in my mind.

659
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Not one doubt in my mind

660
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
that we will fail.

661
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No!

662
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Most people are very unsure about

663
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
failure.

664
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Is that who we want as president?

665
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No, we don't.

666
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We want someone absolutely positive

667
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that we're going to fail.

668
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's leadership.

669
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

670
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
once again,

671
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the George W. Bush Singers.

672
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Woohoo!

673
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And so,

674
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And so,

675
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
am I straight of them?

676
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
My state of the Union.

677
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
My State of the Union

678
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Our State of my State,

679
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Master their name.

680
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
My State to Knock.

681
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Nice.

682
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We want to go in.

683
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You want to call it.

684
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You want to call it.

685
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Speech.

686
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Speech.

687
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Speech.

688
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Speech, pleasure.

689
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
To the.

690
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The.

691
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Action.

692
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I asked the Americans.

693
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I asked to give.

694
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm married to give.

695
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
For a thousand years.

696
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
For a thousand years.

697
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
For a thousand years.

698
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
For a thousand hours.

699
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
For.

700
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Thousand.

701
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I was.

702
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Over the next.

703
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Over the next.

704
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The rest you're.

705
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Of your life.

706
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Of service to a mercy.

707
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Of.

708
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There we go.

709
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Tonight.

710
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's.

711
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That's.

712
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's.

713
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's.

714
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Two.

715
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Two.

716
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Four thousand hours.

717
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Four thousand hours.

718
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh man.

719
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The bush.

720
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The.

721
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Bushism dot net is where you can find more on that.

722
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's just silly.

723
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But you.

724
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You should really see the video of the George W. Bush.

725
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Singers is just so hokey.

726
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's.

727
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It's awesome.

728
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh, by the way.

729
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And when I was listening to another podcast and actually played it on the source code the other day.

730
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I could hear from the other podcast.

731
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I could hear the volume control on the Mac here.

732
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If I turn my volume up on my headphones.

733
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Let me see.

734
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I don't know.

735
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Of course, it's not going to do that for me.

736
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You just give a little blip.

737
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
If you're using a Mac or power book.

738
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Then you can hold down the shift key.

739
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then turn up the volume.

740
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I would probably on a desktop Mac as well.

741
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You.

742
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That blipping noise.

743
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That aside.

744
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I had one more video to play for you about the draft.

745
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But yeah, I like the George W. Bush singer so much.

746
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm going to skip it because I'm just depressed.

747
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Look.

748
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I think you should vote for John Kerry.

749
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
George Bush is in the.

750
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Kuhuts with a whole bunch of guys who got a whole lot of agendas.

751
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The only way we can make sure that.

752
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There's a clean slate that we've got something to work with.

753
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
If we get them out, get a new guy in and keep sharp, sharp look out for what's happening.

754
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And let's not this happen to us again.

755
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We've got all the tools.

756
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We've got our voices.

757
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
We've got our web logs.

758
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The time from weblog to CNN is Dave would say is getting shorter.

759
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's dropped down to hours.

760
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So we do have the power.

761
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And I believe that.

762
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That we should elect John Kerry as our next president.

763
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay.

764
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So no, let's not talk about that anymore.

765
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Let's talk about some cool stuff.

766
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I was talking to Dave on trade secrets the other day.

767
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I think it was on trade secrets.

768
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Maybe it was just.

769
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It all runs together.

770
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't know who I told what anymore.

771
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We were talking about William Shattner.

772
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And I said, you know, William Shattner actually is.

773
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You know, he's got his stuff together.

774
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
He's got a he's got a web log.

775
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
There's daughter maintains.

776
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Oh, we were talking about.

777
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The Peter sellers.

778
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I played Peter sellers did a Beatles song.

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
She loves you.

780
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And he said, didn't Bill Shattner do that.

781
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So he did loosing the sky with diamonds.

782
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So we were talking about the musical career of Bill Shattner.

783
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I had no idea why.

784
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And it turns out loan below loan behold.

785
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He is just released a new album.

786
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's titled William Shattner has been.

787
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And it's got photos, news, videos, press appearances.

788
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Got all kinds of stuff.

789
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's a DVD to go with it.

790
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But the album, check this out.

791
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It includes guest appearances by Joe Jackson, lemon jelly,

792
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Amy Mann, Henry Rollins, and Brad Paisley.

793
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And he's got a couple samples on his website promoting this.

794
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Shattner has been.com.

795
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I would love to play a little bit of it for you.

796
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay, I'm going to play.

797
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You have time.

798
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And I'm playing this from the flash interface and the browser.

799
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So who knows what can happen.

800
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'll be a bit of an experiment.

801
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Here it comes.

802
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Now.

803
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Maybe you won't suffer.

804
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Maybe it's quick.

805
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But you'll have time to think.

806
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why did I waste it?

807
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Why didn't I taste it?

808
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You'll have time.

809
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Because you're...

810
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Gonna die.

811
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yes, it's gonna happen because it's happened to a lot of people I know.

812
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
My mother, my father, my loves.

813
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
The president, the kings of the pope.

814
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
They all had a hole.

815
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And they muttered just before they went.

816
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Maybe I won't go.

817
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Live life like you're gonna die.

818
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Because you are.

819
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Maybe you won't suffer.

820
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Maybe it's quick.

821
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But you'll have time to think.

822
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Why did I waste it?

823
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Why didn't I taste it?

824
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You'll have time.

825
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Because you're...

826
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Gonna die.

827
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm gonna die.

828
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I tell you else left us.

829
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Best I've gone to heaven along the rules.

830
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Johnny Cash!

831
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah!

832
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
JFK, that guy in the stones.

833
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah!

834
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Luke Garic, Einstein, and...

835
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Joey Ramon.

836
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Johnny Ramon.

837
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Have I convinced you that you're replying lips?

838
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
This may come as news, but it's time.

839
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay.

840
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So unfortunately, that's all there is.

841
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's all in China.

842
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Let me...

843
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Well...

844
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Stop that.

845
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It goes into the interview.

846
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Wise words for a man in his 70s,

847
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
who's been around and seems to be enjoying life every single day.

848
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You'll have time.

849
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Bill Shattner from his album has been...

850
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Can't wait to get my hands on a copy to play the fool song for.

851
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah.

852
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Just a word or two about some new podcast feeds that are really exciting.

853
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I told you before that I've been working with Tony Khan of...

854
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
WGBH embossed in public radio.

855
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And he is the writer and producer of a show called Morning Stories.

856
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And there's short stories.

857
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
They're read by a normal people who he coaches through the whole process.

858
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
He produces these wonderful, you know, two to three minute stories.

859
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I've played some of them here on the source code.

860
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And he finally...

861
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He got it done.

862
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Somehow he got MPR to, you know, to figure out all the rights issues.

863
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And they've put up a feed, a podcast feed.

864
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You can find it in the directory under public radio.

865
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I think this is just the start of many more MPR shows to come to...

866
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to a podcast thing.

867
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And we welcome them all, of course.

868
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And I'm very excited about it.

869
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Also, KOMO news from Seattle, KOMO 1000, I think it is.

870
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They have also put up a podcast feed.

871
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I've got this delay again.

872
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It sounds like it got the rubber ball back.

873
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
One of those red, what rubber balls, you know,

874
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
the one with the leather strap that goes around at the back of your head like the GIMP.

875
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay.

876
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So KOMO 1000 news is doing it exactly the way I think it should be done.

877
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
They produce these, you know, little news bulletins.

878
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
These 40 to 40 is a 60 second news stories.

879
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Which is fun, you know, because now for the first time I play this,

880
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I can actually see how long these stories are.

881
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And I'll get like three or four one after another.

882
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And they sit there in the playlist.

883
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And the reason that it's so cool that each individual podcast is a news story.

884
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
If you don't like the topic of the story, just hit the next button, boom,

885
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
you're on into the next story.

886
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So it's fantastic and so happy that they're supporting podcasting this way.

887
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Again, also one I think of many still to come.

888
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And of course in the past couple of days,

889
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
there's once again been many different opinions about just what podcasting is

890
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and what it's worth.

891
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And well, I want to share some of that with you.

892
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I wish to do some podcasting.

893
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
No, you cannot afford to.

894
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Why not?

895
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh, you have me in.

896
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
When does 95?

897
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
No, I'm podcasting.

898
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What?

899
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The term itself is bullshit.

900
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh, fantastic.

901
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And it's funny how you can see the game of telephone working with these podcasts.

902
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I heard a podcast from who was at Northwest noise.

903
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I think it was.

904
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And he was referring to my podcast from the car where I said,

905
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
you know, I really love my A8, my Audi OA8.

906
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's got everything I need, all the technical bits,

907
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
but it's kind of boring and unsexy.

908
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And he was talking about me saying that, you know,

909
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I wasn't too hot on the car.

910
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I was like, no, no, no, no, don't get me wrong.

911
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So the history of podcasting also is,

912
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
you know, it gets its twist here and there.

913
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And of course, you can leave it up to Raster Web Audio,

914
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
our buddy Pete to bring you the complete

915
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and correct history of podcasting.

916
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Welcome to Raster Web Audio,

917
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
441008.

918
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Raster Web Audio is proud to bring you this audio biography,

919
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
the history of podcasting.

920
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Adam Carey was born in New York, New Jersey,

921
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the younger brother of Jim Carey.

922
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Adam always had an interest in the law and lawyoring,

923
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
but soon found himself involved with pirates

924
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
who would steal transistoradios from Dr. Cyril's medical office,

925
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and sell them on e-bates,

926
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
the lives of David Winner,

927
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
a man obsessed with digging and digging and still digging.

928
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Soon Adam met up with another Dave,

929
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Dave Slushie, the founder of 711,

930
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and together they came up with a way to make

931
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
a video images of Tim Conway,

932
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
appear on your giant flat screen TV,

933
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
even if you lived in Conroy, South Dakota,

934
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
or anywhere a hurricane was likely to hit.

935
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Later, Adam and Dave teamed up with the Gilmour Girls

936
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
and tried something called poo casting,

937
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
but found that the audience for people who wanted poo

938
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
auto-magically delivered to their front porch morning

939
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
with extremely small,

940
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
even among people who listened to NPR,

941
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
or were on NPR,

942
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
or used to have a radio show,

943
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
or even if they lived in Conroy, South Dakota.

944
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Eventually pod casting was invented,

945
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and we had a way to deliver iPods

946
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
to every boy and girl in the New Zealand.

947
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But the only problem was that all of the files

948
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
on the iPods were stolen from Steve Gapes,

949
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
the creator of Microsoftware,

950
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and this made him mad,

951
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
so a guy named Stephen Jobs kicked his ass quite hard,

952
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and the flow of free iPods continued.

953
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And that's how pod casting came to be,

954
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and the fact that you're listening to this right now,

955
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
is proof that it works.

956
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This has been audio biography.

957
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Thank you, and good night.

958
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Just had great visions of poo casting

959
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
with the Gilmour Girls.

960
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Excellent.

961
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Another podcast that popped up

962
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
is a professional radio feed from CBC,

963
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Canada, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,

964
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
which operates very much like a pod cast.

965
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
People can contribute to CBC,

966
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
the listeners do actively contribute,

967
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and a story showed up on CBC,

968
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and of course it was copied over to their pod cast,

969
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
all about pod casting.

970
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This is much less humorous,

971
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
but very well put together,

972
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and I think just an excellent overview of pod casting.

973
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
In a coffee shop in Charlotte Town,

974
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Stephen Garrity is sitting down with a friend,

975
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
a cup of lemonade tea,

976
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and a laptop computer,

977
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
a few key strokes later,

978
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and he's on the air.

979
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Live from the poor most of the time.

980
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Live from the poor most of the time.

981
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Live from the poor most of the time.

982
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We're back to the poor most of the time.

983
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
This is Stephen Garrity here I'm here with.

984
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
This is the new face of radio,

985
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
at least if people like Garrity have their way.

986
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's called pod casting.

987
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It works like this.

988
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Ordinary people record their own show of sorts

989
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
into their computer,

990
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
then they post that show online

991
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
for others to download and listen to.

992
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But don't expect high production values yet.

993
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
This is a trend just emerging.

994
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Garrity show is interrupted by commercials.

995
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's interrupted by the waiter.

996
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Interesting, in five or five.

997
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Thank you.

998
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Indeed, most pod cast shows so far sound,

999
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
a little bit campy.

1000
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Hi, welcome to the Don and Drew Show.

1001
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm Don and Sally.

1002
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Take this example.

1003
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Broadcast from Wayne was constant.

1004
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And it's cold.

1005
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's very cold.

1006
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We started fire today.

1007
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah.

1008
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Well, like on the wood in the wood burner.

1009
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
In the wood burner.

1010
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So Drew starts opening up with what you're wearing.

1011
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay, I'm wearing some hammy downhill figurines.

1012
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But others sound downright professional.

1013
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
From the Silicon Valley,

1014
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Dan Finsett and the rest of California.

1015
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm Eric Grace.

1016
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And this is my show.

1017
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This guy created a show by literally wandering around

1018
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
a technology conference with his laptop

1019
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and doing impromptu interviews with industry

1020
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
potted tea bumped into.

1021
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm sending her with Sam Tesla who started.

1022
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And this is very deja vu,

1023
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
especially for those of you familiar with the Apple

1024
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Store user group.

1025
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You started a user group.

1026
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Podcasting is evolving out of the blog trend.

1027
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Short for web blog.

1028
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Sort of an online diary.

1029
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And like the beginnings of the blogging trend.

1030
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Today's podcastures are mostly extreme computer users.

1031
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
The early adopters for whom the word nerd is a badge of honor.

1032
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But increasingly, their content is going mainstream.

1033
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, good afternoon, friends, family, world leaders.

1034
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code for Wednesday October.

1035
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
This guy Adam Curry used to be a VJMTV.

1036
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Now, he produces a daily podcast out of his castle in the Netherlands.

1037
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Actually, we got a lot of cool things lined up for today's show.

1038
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I've got a couple of songs to play for you.

1039
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Lots of examples of new podcasts.

1040
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
One of the reasons podcasting is taking off is the way it's distributed.

1041
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Listeners can download the show and play it on their computer,

1042
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
but there's an easier way.

1043
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Using special software,

1044
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
listeners who own iPods, those portable music devices from Apple,

1045
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
can have their iPod automatically store the latest episode of their favorite show.

1046
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's sort of like a VCR that takes your favorite programs overnight while you sleep.

1047
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Except in this case, it's taping radio shows.

1048
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
For now, if you want to catch a podcast, you'll have to hunt around.

1049
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The main website that lists available shows, podcaster.net,

1050
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
only has about 35 shows listed.

1051
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But that number is growing daily.

1052
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
As more people become self-made talk show hosts.

1053
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And that is getting some radio executives nervous.

1054
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Think about it.

1055
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
With enough of an audience of iPod listeners,

1056
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
it's entirely possible some of the better podcasters could actually attract advertisers.

1057
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Advertisers who want to reach tech savvy and niche market listeners.

1058
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
In that scenario, radio stations, as we traditionally know them,

1059
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
would become irrelevant.

1060
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Who needs to tune to a particular station,

1061
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
or even bookmark a specific website.

1062
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
If every morning, your listening device is already filtered out the shows you don't like,

1063
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and left the few you do.

1064
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You might argue it's already happening to television,

1065
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
where fewer viewers stick with a single channel through a whole evening,

1066
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
but rather pick and choose based on the show brand.

1067
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Either way, today's podcasters are onto something,

1068
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
with that they realize it or not.

1069
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Can I internet for a CDC radio?

1070
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm Todd Maffin.

1071
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Excellent piece, absolutely phenomenal.

1072
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And actually, I'm considering adding that to the default feed

1073
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
that iPoders are now using.

1074
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You know, you have the welcome, the kind of like hello world it worked

1075
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and installed.

1076
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm considering adding that one.

1077
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's not too big in file size,

1078
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and I think it'll be just cool if that all sudden started playing.

1079
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You'd really get a good idea of what's already out there.

1080
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It mentions iPodor.net, which they have more than 35 feeds now.

1081
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
They have about 64 feeds.

1082
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm considering asking those guys if they would like to become a node

1083
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
of the directory of iPodor.org,

1084
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
they have some different, they travel in different circles.

1085
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So let's connect this together.

1086
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Let's make this as big as possible.

1087
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Okay, so you've set through all of that.

1088
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It's about 48 minutes into your hour that we're here on the source code.

1089
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Gonna play you a song that'll pick up your spirits for a Monday.

1090
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's Grand Funk Railroad.

1091
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't need a whole lots of money.

1092
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't need a big fine car.

1093
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I got everything that I made before.

1094
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I got more than I could ask for.

1095
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I don't have to burn around.

1096
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I don't have to stay out all night.

1097
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Cause I got me a sweet, a sweet living woman.

1098
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Cause you know just how to treat me right.

1099
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But my baby, she's all right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1105
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
When I hold all in my arm, you know she sets my soul on fire.

1106
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Ooh, when the baby kisses me.

1107
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
My heart becomes still with desire.

1108
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
When she raps the Lord and all around me.

1109
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
About to rise me out of my mind.

1110
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, I'll give my baby kiss to me.

1111
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
She's been up and down my spine.

But my baby, she's clean outside.

I've unsubscribe from a few, just because, well, you know what,

1146
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,640
the big problem, the reason why is because hard drive size.
