1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
On casting, all's live, Adam Curry.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,200
Hey everybody, how you doing?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,000
How are you doing?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you doing?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,200
Coming to you from the United Kingdom, from Curry Cottage.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,600
It is your daily source code.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,800
Today is Tuesday, November 30th, 2004.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
I think we got to stop with this everybody stuff.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,200
There's just too many people doing it.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
How you doing?

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Uh, everyone?

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,900
Got a jam and show for you today, completely filled up with all kinds of goods

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,900
that were done with desktop filled with quick time layers and just to wait in here.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,400
And I've adjusted the microphone.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:47,600
I got some feedback from Dave Winner and also from, well, via Dave, it was Steve Gilmore

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
who said, you know, where's the reverb?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
You said all this cool reverb on your voice and I was thinking,

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
you should have never done any reverb ever, I don't think.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,200
And then I realized that it was the old castle bar that I was podcasting from in the beginning.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,700
It was so hollow, it sounded like a reverb.

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,200
So what I've done is, um, I've added some reverb just so you guys can feel like I'm hanging out

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,700
here in the castle, even though nothing could be farther from the truth.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Deadly source code for today.

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Well, secondly, just a good one thing I'll set up here.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Starts off with an email in response to my use of this very, uh, track that you're hearing

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,700
this drum cadence, uh, Joel Hawksley said that dude.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Thanks for playing my audio of the Michigan cadence.

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Of course, I screwed it up, right?

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Uh, I called him a drum band.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
He said, actually a drum cadence from Michigan State University.

31
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Not a drum band as I commented.

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Here in America, he says, most schools middle school through college level.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
In fact, I've marching bands.

34
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
I myself am, uh, in one of my local high school here in Kent, Ohio.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
And, uh, oh, by the way, he says I've played the drums.

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Actually, I kind of like it, just listen to that.

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Let's crank it up for a second.

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
A little bit of drum cadence.

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,700
The email me back, let me know how you recorded that.

40
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:26,700
More email that's been coming in, um, regarding English inventions, which seems to be, you know, just a vibe that, uh, that we've caught here.

41
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Uh, we're always taught electricity and, uh, you know, minor things like television.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
We're all invented in the United States.

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,700
Oh, nothing could be further from the truth now that I'm living in the UK.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,700
We find out that pretty much everything was invented in, uh, in the old country.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Stuart Hunter says, um, of course, this is something that we figured out yesterday as well as John

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Logie Bear, the inventor of television.

47
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Don't forget the inventor of the telephone.

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Yes, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.

49
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Cool.

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,700
This is from, uh, so Stuart Hunter who was an Edinburgh native now living and working in Florida.

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,700
Alexander Graham Bell was born.

52
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
I mean, how long did he live in the United Kingdom?

53
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Should we really look that up?

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,700
See, that's another thing.

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,700
You know, it's, I guess it's not an American invention, then technically.

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Uh, let's see.

57
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Got an email here from Josh.

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:24,700
By the way, all of this, of course, is on the, uh, pod show production notes, which you can find a company with, uh, in the description of every single, uh, podcast, uh,

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Beyond the Daily Source Code of DailySource Code.com.

60
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Hey, Adam says, Josh, some of your notes on, uh, November 26,

61
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Daily Source Code.

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,700
It says, uh, first of all, New Zealand and Australia, we also use the Bayonet lamps.

63
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,700
That's, uh, what I discovered here that, uh, it doesn't seem to be as common to have screw lamps.

64
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,700
They're easy to put in, but you can't do that trick.

65
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Tom Cruise did a mission of possible where he turned out the light without having to find the switch, and that's true.

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,700
And we're to the UK power plugs are, uh, are big because they contain a fuse.

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Ah, that's what it is.

68
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700
So that's switch, I guess, is, it's a trip fuse.

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,700
I thought it was just an on-off switch, but apparently, uh, every single, uh,

70
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
uh, electric socket in the UK contains a fuse.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700
So they are indeed very safe.

72
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Uh, and they says, finally, uh, Japan, uh, in Korea, and he thinks in Taiwan,

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,700
they use a hundred, uh, 110 volts.

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Didn't know that.

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,700
And still no one knows.

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,700
Was able to tell me exactly why some countries have 220 volts and why have 110 volts.

77
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,700
And furthering to, uh, British life, high Adam, who's this from?

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I can't, uh, from Max, Max says, some further info on British life and practices.

79
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,700
First, Sainsbury's, I talked about this on a previous podcast, is not the mega super store.

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Tesco has about another 10% market share and Sainsbury's is in financial turmoil.

81
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,700
Excuse me for being so incredibly wrong about that.

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Uh, there are switches on UK plugs for safety and usability.

83
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,700
It's not very useful having individual switches.

84
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Okay.

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,700
So that was, uh, just a confirmation there that there's actually a fuse inside the UK plugs.

86
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
The British transport system he goes on to say is generally appalling with the exception of air travel.

87
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,700
I have to agree, but I also find the British airways very expensive, um, in many cases.

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Although they have a lot of choice of where you can sit.

89
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,700
I like that too about British airways.

90
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Uh, there's like three different versions of business class you can choose from.

91
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Uh, so you can have like, you can still be in business class and, but really be a low life in business class and still be cool.

92
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
And he goes on to say our friend Max.

93
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,700
I was also slightly disappointed since you were in London that your FM scan didn't involve capital FM,

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
the main pop radio station in London.

95
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,700
That's interesting because I have seen capital on the, on the radio.

96
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Um, I don't know, maybe I skipped over to call that something else or maybe I just missed it.

97
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,700
He says for what it's worth BBC SCR is BBC South Coast radio.

98
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Okay. So that's, I guess I'm close to the South Coast.

99
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Also radio one is not referred to as BBC one.

100
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
That's reversed for TV channels.

101
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,700
BBC one. Oh, that's reserved for the TV channels.

102
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,700
BBC one, BBC three and four.

103
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Okay. And he says, and you were very lucky getting any child into a British school.

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
And you'd better lose the US accent.

105
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Okay, Max.

106
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,700
I feel so welcome once again in the UK with everybody helping me out.

108
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Just trying to get accustomed to life here in Blighty.

109
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:32,900
Woah, let's say its the first time we've been reciting a second time for college stages…

110
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Yeah, exactly.

111
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Whoa, it's fun.

112
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
You believe in miracles?

113
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Yeah.

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Play ball.

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Welcome to the Sports Park for Friday.

116
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
November 26th.

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm Curtis.

118
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
So I can move at 7 p.m.

119
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900

120
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
And I want to hear from you.

121
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Texan voicing males go to Curtis at ds45.com.

122
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
That's Curtis.

123
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,900
If you got your new and improved and of course,

124
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
and the world,

125
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Hey Curtis, Chris Rickard calling for my,

126
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
it better with me while I give you a take without a freaking read.

127
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
First of all.

128
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Okay.

129
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
That's the Sports Pod.

130
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,900
You got to listen to the sports pod podcast.

131
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Yeah, they've got correspondence and

132
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:28,900
it's not like, but you know,

133
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,460
Correspondence and it's beautiful. It's just a whole bunch of guys

134
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,780
bunch of guys who you know the exports and just wanted to

135
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,700
Do stuff with sports on their podcast links of course to the iPod or director under

136
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,580
Sports check out the the sports pod or you can go to the sports pod dot com

137
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Now the email here from Lee

138
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,980
Of course again all these all these comments emails can be found in the

139
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,460
Podcast production notes. I was having a conversation with a clerk in a story was telling me that it is a

140
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,620
He's a new XM subscriber because of opian Anthony

141
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,700
I don't know who opian Anthony are but I guess that the I guess XM of course is a satellite

142
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,900
Just like Howard Stern has serious a went to serious satellite radio

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,380
XM is another satellite radio company. I think it's the only other one

144
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,060
I guess opian Anthony are two hilarious radio guys

145
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Goes on to say yeah

146
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,220
I mentioned I spend way too much money on iTunes with my iPod

147
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,900
He responded to say yeah, I love my iPod, but I don't do podcasting

148
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,660
I let the casual conversation finish while getting my card hit me this guy mentioned podcasting

149
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,740
Lesson six months and podcasting is already being dropped in casual conversation

150
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,860
No, it was a casual geek conversation, but still

151
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,420
Okay, Lee excellent and that is happening more and more by the way

152
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,380
I just had an interview with the Dutch radio one which is kind of a big deal

153
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,540
for the Netherlands because you know if you get

154
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
You know like 15 minutes

155
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,860
To talk about podcasting on a Dutch radio one that that's a a lot of time

156
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,780
I really didn't have to do much talking or convincing because they had some

157
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,220
Girl or some young woman who would basically I guess is their consumer woman and they said here

158
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,580
You know go pot go check out podcasting for a week and she was so in love with what she had heard

159
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,180
That I didn't need to tell anyone anything. She basically sold the whole thing right there. It was it was great

160
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,340
Hey Adam Heather Hollick says love the BBC bit. Oh, this is Heather from from the BBC segment if you haven't seen it

161
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,740
I have no idea how she got into that show by the way

162
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,180
She must know Colin the producer Adam love the BBC bit. I was on the show as well as

163
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,780
One of the podcasting enthusiasts quote unquote

164
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,380
It was a blast we recently moved to London as well and are chronicling the inventor on our blog at living in London

165
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,420
It's a Heather and her friend Linda are now

166
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,540

167
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,900
I was kind of wondering you know

168
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:10,100
Who's this what was that what was the the title again home on the second it was podcasting enthusiast

169
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,140
I'm the daddy of podcasting but Heather is a podcasting enthusiast

170
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,780
podcasting enthusiasts

171
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Cool how they're nice to meet you. Thank you very much. I also linked to your blog and to I guess it's a

172
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,100
The head on Linda site from the pod so pod show production notes

173
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,740
Don and drew were pretty excited about

174
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,100
About being on the BBC and that sparked a whole conversation on the Don and drew show

175
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Love that

176
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Yeah, that's too

177
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Mister drew curry

178
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,260
Mister and Mrs Adam and drew curry all this little hearts it's sad actually. I can't believe you looked in there

179
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,060
That's supposed to be private. You pick the lock. Oh, I don't need to pick a toothpick

180
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
It's not much of a lock

181
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,580
I couldn't believe all those hearts. I'm just taking you hours in colored pencil

182
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,620
I couldn't believe the curry castle that place was pretty kickass

183
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
And flying into the helicopter

184
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
We have a helicopter

185
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,740
Yeah

186
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
We have a castle

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,420
We just our house is cool the Barbie castle and my little RC helicopter drew our house is a piece of shit

188
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,700
We don't have any money our house is shitty. We don't have house in our house is

189
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Not around

190
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,580
We're sitting underneath water stains on the ceiling and the carpet is all ripped up

191
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,820
What do you want to like what you have to live in some fancy place?

192
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,180
Yeah, forcing now you are because you're on the BBC

193
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,740
Yes, I first since I was on the BBC. I want better things

194
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,340
I'm trying I'm working hard. Come on baby. I'm here for you Don. I can take you away from drew and his

195
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,620
Danki old house

196
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,380
Working to the like fingers to the bone

197
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,860
I'll try to provide and his bony fingers

198
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Okay, you guys

199
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,980
She was doing something nerdy tonight in the website. I'm not exactly sure what it was because it's nerdy and I think that's boring

200
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,140
Therefore

201
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
What did did she say boy

202
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,060
Because it's nerdy and I think that's boring. Okay boring sounded like boy

203
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,980
Therefore

204
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Stupid not worth my time

205
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,420
But he might want to talk about it because he seemed to really be excited

206
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,340
What about something nerdy happening? I'm just I'm getting in the opium l

207
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,220
Getting into using radio usually land as an outliner and so

208
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,540
Similar to the way Adam Curry's doing his production notes. I'm kind of doing something similar

209
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,580
Except I'm tying it into my movable type entries

210
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,860
So that you don't have to leave our site to go see the production notes. They're not really production notes

211
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
I mean, his show is obviously a lot different than ours

212
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,220
So mine is like what what what do you mean obviously a lot different?

213
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:17,780
I hope dawn defends me on that 12 minutes in dawn rants about assholes 12 minutes one second

214
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
Why are you ripping on that?

215
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,300
I'm just saying it's kind of funny to have production notes when it's just us talking

216
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,940
Then it really production notes. It's more like like I said his or production notes were hey

217
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,380
Don't rip on my boyfriend drew ours aren't ours are like after the fact

218
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,940
Describing what happened in the show

219
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,900
You know I never listen to the shows you do sometimes we listen to it after we record until I lose interest

220
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,500
I have a very short attention span but if you laugh

221
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,580
While we're re-listening to the show then I know it's gonna be pretty good one

222
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,500
You're you're a tough cookie you guys. I got a lot of emails from you people that call me a fucking quitter

223
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,580
You know what this is the thing if you've been listening for the last few months

224
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,060
You know I'm kind of mental so some days

225
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,540
I'm not chipper and full of sunshine

226
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,740
Some days I'm irritable and bitchy and moody

227
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Don't say I being married to her

228
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,100
You should be sending me like bouquets and candy or something

229
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
bouquets and candy yeah

230
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
What about

231
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,420
For my hardships dealing with your moody this I should be giving some kind of award away for what

232
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Living with your stanky feet

233
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,460
Don and Drew show a bit there on the daily source code for you today

235
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Hello, this is Giliad me down in some Paula Brazil. I listen to your podcasts

236
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,620
Every morning all my way to work. I think they're great. I hope everything's fine with the

237
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,900
move to England and you know just basically settling down in a

238
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,820
different city different country and all that

239
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,140
The podcasting scene down here in Brazil is you know

240
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,620
It's gonna take a while to take off mainly because in my opinion because of the

241
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,300
prices of the MP3 players down here

242
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,540
They go for about a thousand american dollars which is whoa

243
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,380
Hold on a second a thousand american dollars

244
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,540
Dude

245
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,180
What is up with that we need to have more information why is it so expensive?

246
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,580
What I mean an MP3 player cost you can get a $450

247
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,740
Gee please let us know email back. This is crazy

248
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,940
You know just wait to expensive

249
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,060
For Brazil, but there's a few people trying

250
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,060
I'm one of them

251
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,060
There's a guy in Rio at

252
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,660
They're still minds.com.br which has a great podcast

253
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,980
About technology and and gadgets and stuff like that

254
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:14,260
And well basically I just wanted to let you know that got some listeners down here and we really enjoy your show

255
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,860
Keep up the good work and we're gonna be listening down here. All right. Thanks a lot. Take care

256
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,340
Yo buddy cool. Thank you very much for sending in your comment. Also your email which I put up in the

257
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,860
Production show notes for today's show

258
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,900
Unbelievable thousand dollars for an MP3 player. Yeah, that's

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,860
Bad something is like someone that's like some rip off going on there

260
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:43,060
I don't understand how that's possible is that to import duties or what is it or is it just an incredible opportunity to go sell some of these three players

261
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,700
I caught another episode of one of my pod squad favorites covervill which was an all request covervill once again and

262
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
You know covervill pays

263
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:03,540
For an ass cap and a BMI license to play these songs and I'm hoping that that's that's more than enough

264
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,100
I'm not too sure but you know of course that's it's been working quite well. I know here any complaints

265
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,420
I have everyone loves the show and I want to play a bit of covervill

266
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,260
Which I'll just have to call us fair use because I am playing a recording of a show in in a news oriented show

267
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,420
And news entertainment area into the show and adverse an advertorial

268
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,100
Because you know I am the ed Sullivan of podcasting

269
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,300
But the whole reason I'm playing this for you with with the intro and even a little bit of the outro

270
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,380
From the most recent covervill is because it's it's the it's a version of

271
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,780
Nothing compares to you which I've never heard before of course. I knew the song was written by Prince and

272
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,540
Originally recorded and made into a world smash by Schneido Connor I'd never heard a Prince version and of course

273
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,180
You can leave it to covervill to bring you that but got a an email from

274
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,540
Steve Carter this week who

275
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,500
Said you know the one thing that the list is missing is Schneido Connor's cover of nothing compares to you

276
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,580
And I said well, you know that that's true wrote him back and I said that's true except

277
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,740
Technically her version is in a cover Prince wrote it she she performed it and

278
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:22,740
And then Prince later covered it himself about years after it went big but I stand corrected here

279
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,300
In the preparation for tonight's show looking up the information

280
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:35,940
Actually Schneido Connor wasn't the first person to perform it that credit goes to a group called the family and this was a

281
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,220
Kind of a

282
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,580
Prince influenced

283
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,100
group that was made up of a couple members of the time and then

284
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
a couple other people

285
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,220
And he

286
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:55,860
gave them the song they released in 1985 as part of their one and only album self titled down the family and

287
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,660
And didn't really go anywhere so

288
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,140
Schneido Connor covered it in

289
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:10,580
1988 and made a very big hit out of it and then later on Prince covered it himself

290
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,980
So technically Prince is still covering his own song, but Schneido Connor's version is a cover as well

291
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,980
So let's jump into the

292
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,020
Prince cover of nothing compares to you

293
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Here's Prince on covervill

294
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
Start

295
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
I

296
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,940
Yeah

297
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,000
It's been sitting

298
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,860
But today, sit you to your love

299
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,860
I don't want every night, sleep all day

300
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Sit you to your love

301
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:30,860
Listen, then oh I can do whatever I want

302
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I can seem whoever I choose

303
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Eat my dinner and a fancy festival

304
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Oh yeah, but not there, not there, you can take away the spirit

305
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Oh yeah, I think I'm dead

306
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Nothing compares to you, oh yeah

307
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:18,360
It's been so lonely without you

308
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm like a bird, I've done the song

309
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Nothing can stop this lonely rain

310
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?

311
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Oh baby, I can put my thoughts around everything I see

312
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Oh yeah, but they only remind me of you

313
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Oh my name for my new children, oh yeah

314
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I went to the doctor, that's going to tell me

315
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,360
What to take, that's what I told me

316
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,360
You want to see

317
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Nothing compares to you

318
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

319
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

320
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

321
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

322
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

323
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

324
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Oh baby, where did I go wrong?

325
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,960
I know that I'm living with the pain and it's so time's hard

326
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,460
So time's hard, but I'm feeling it wrong

327
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,360
I'm feeling it wrong, I'm feeling it wrong

328
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm feeling it wrong, I'm feeling it wrong

329
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,860
I'm feeling it wrong, I'm feeling it wrong

330
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:47,860
Suddenly I'm living with the pain and it's so time's hard

331
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,740
Yes, like you'll be

332
00:23:50,740 --> 00:24:01,760
And now when you can I'm living with the pain

333
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:17,660
You know, I would pay a huge amount of money to subscribe to a Prince Podcast.

334
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,860
Seriously, seriously, how cool would that be?

335
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,860
This is so up his alley, you should be so all over this.

336
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Thanks to Coverville for bringing us special rendition of nothing compares to you.

337
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,860
Brought to you by Prince and I presume a new power generation, or parts of it, or something like that,

338
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,860
and I never know what Prince is doing.

339
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Two guys I want to talk about now, who are members of the Pod Squad,

340
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,860
and I'll put a link to the Pod Squad page again,

341
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,860
trying to, well, basically trying to use some technology bits to combine some things.

342
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Now, how vague did that sound?

343
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Anyway, Pod Squad or body is mine, who have been hanging out with since,

344
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
since way back in the beginning of Podcasting.

345
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Remember, back in those days, like four months ago?

346
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
So one of them is Michael Goat.

347
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Oh, man, I haven't purchased his name in a long time.

348
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
Michael Goat.

349
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Welcome to Real Reviews, films worth watching.

350
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
Michael Goat.

351
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Thanks for joining us again.

352
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,860
As always, we are easy to reach on the web at mwgblog.com.

353
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
So that's Michael Goat.

354
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Goat.

355
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Goat.

356
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Goat.

357
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
Goat.

358
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Goat.

359
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Goat.

360
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
Goat.

361
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
Goat.

362
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
Goat.

363
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
Goat.

364
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Let's see, Michael Goat.

365
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Welcome to Real Reviews, films worth watching.

366
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Michael Goat.

367
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
Goat.

368
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
Goat.

369
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Goat.

370
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Goat.

371
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Goat.

372
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
Goat.

373
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Goat.

374
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Goat.

375
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
Goat.

376
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
Goat.

377
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Hey, Michael Goat.

378
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
He's a member of the Pod Squad.

379
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,860
And he is another member of the Pod Squad.

380
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,860
You've probably heard of this guy, Michael Butler.

381
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
This is Bama.

382
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
And you're listening to the rock and roll.

383
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Geek.

384
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
So.

385
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,860
And I am gonna have sex with the hose.

386
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:29,860
So, you can get to both of those podcasts from the iPod or director of course.

387
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,860
You heard Michael's web address.

388
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,860
And the Rock and Roll Geek Show, of course, can be found at Rock and RollGeek.com.

389
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Why do I play these two bits of podcasts for you today?

390
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Because I caught something interesting on Michael's weblog.

391
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,860
He says, I've agreed to sponsor the next few editions of the rock and roll Geek Show.

392
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
Why am I asked?

393
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Because Michael Butler puts on a kick ass show.

394
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,860
He says, one that I listened to at the same time that I keep hearing.

395
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,860
That.

396
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
A lot of seconds.

397
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
I missed a piece of the posting there.

398
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
Let me just go to this page.

399
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Shoot my daughter disconnect your phone line.

400
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
Let's see.

401
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,860
You might still have it.

402
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Is it going to come in?

403
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Yeah, there we go.

404
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,860
At the same time, keep hearing.

405
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
I'm trying to get a high-income sponsorship.

406
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
That's what I thought I was saying.

407
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
I think he will.

408
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,860
But in the meantime, since I'm fan and want to support it,

409
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,860
I figured the best way to go about that was to sponsor the show.

410
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,860
And they go into this whole thing about business models.

411
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,860
And the place of success for podcasting.

412
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
And there are some comments there.

413
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
There's a good.

414
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
Some good comments getting started.

415
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Which are kind of a long, some other conversations.

416
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm going to just turn this down a little bit more.

417
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
I can't go any softer than that.

418
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
I'm not sure if they can.

419
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,860
There we go.

420
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
Just get it in the background like so.

421
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,860
I saw that Doug K of IT Conversations.com had put out a similar.

422
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,860
A question or request saying, hey, you know, what's it going to be?

423
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,860
Are we going to do commercials?

424
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
Are we going to have the tip jar?

425
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Do people want to subscribe?

426
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
So that's.

427
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,860
It's an interesting little conversation that's going on there.

428
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,860
I think the more people should weigh in with it to sense worth.

429
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,860
I have really been trying, by the way, to get this highly

430
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Consponsorship for the Rock and Roll Geek Show.

431
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,860
I sent off an email to Jose.

432
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,860
But he might have used to work at Heineken here at the headquarters.

433
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,860
And also, there's a lot of people at Heineken USA.

434
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
And he said he was going to get on on it.

435
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
And I sent him a logo of the Rock and Roll Geek Show,

436
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
which if you've ever seen it in iTunes,

437
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
if you looked at the ID3 tags,

438
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
you'll see that the Rock and Roll Geek Show

439
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,860
is a Heineken logo with Heineken handily replaced

440
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,860
by the Words Rock and Roll Geek Show.

441
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,860
So it's cool though to see a lot of love

442
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,860
flowing through the Pod Squad.

443
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Another email from Tim Germer,

444
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,860
who points me to 15 megs of fame,

445
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
a site that gives listeners a free way

446
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,860
of discovering new music online.

447
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
Very cool.

448
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
Also, it has recommendations engine.

449
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,860
I looked around for a couple of tunes.

450
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
But really, I like getting songs that are recommended

451
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,860
by a source code listeners myself.

452
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
But that is one place you can go look.

453
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,860
I've also placed a couple of other links

454
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
to some other comments and emails about

455
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,860
non-reabase music, rea being RIA,

456
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
even a French song.

457
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,860
So go and check those out and you find anything.

458
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Definitely let me know because I do love,

459
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,860
I do have playing all kinds of stuff on the source code.

460
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
Let's listen to Michael Butler.

461
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Rock and Roll Geek Show.

462
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
This is Michael Butler, it's Sunday.

463
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,860
November 28th, 2004.

464
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
Thanks a lot for listening.

465
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
This is take two of this episode.

466
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
I've got almost completely done with it.

467
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
I was grooving.

468
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
Oh no.

469
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
Oh no.

470
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Oh no.

471
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
Oh no, hold on.

472
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
I need to get some of my own scary scary music in there.

473
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
What happened? Oh my gosh.

474
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,860
How are we going to find out what happened?

475
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Now I'm not grooving.

476
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
So I was halfway through the episode,

477
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
almost all the way through it.

478
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,860
It was going quite well if I do say

479
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,860
to myself and I got a Colonel panic.

480
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Oh, a whole computer crash.

481
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,860
So it didn't get saved.

482
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
So I was fucked.

483
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Okay.

484
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Oh man.

485
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
So Colonel panic, that definitely sucks.

486
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
That's like a unique thing.

487
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
You're not supposed to get that.

488
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,860
This is why I'm still recording on my

489
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
external Samsung app.

490
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,860
150 dollar MP3 player recorder.

491
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,860
And man, the such room for improvement for this stuff.

492
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,860
There really is.

493
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,860
And Michael, when I get my new one in

494
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
because I ordered a couple that have been on long long

495
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,860
back order, I will send you off mine.

496
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
So you can use that.

497
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
You just plug it into the headphone jack

498
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
and record straight from there.

499
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
It's the safest way to go my brother.

500
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,860
That's what I've found out several times myself.

501
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
Many, many times way too often.

502
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
It's just not worth it.

503
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Not worth it at all.

504
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
So as I've been going through some bandwidth with

505
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
draws, I've noticed a couple things that are not

506
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,860
right with our iPodders, with our iPod or

507
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,860
software.

508
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,860
So here's what's happening.

509
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
So let's say you go away on vacation.

510
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
That's probably the best example.

511
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Because I'm effectively a man vacation.

512
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
I don't have any broad band at home.

513
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,860
So what I get to do is I get to go to the

514
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,860
Starbucks here, which closes at 6 p.m. on weekdays.

515
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,860
6 30 on Saturdays and 5 30 on Sundays.

516
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
So after helping out with Patricia and today,

517
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,860
man, I like all kinds of boxes up to the attic and

518
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
out to the garage.

519
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,860
We're getting very close to having a very

520
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
livable environment.

521
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,860
But, you know, so real busy, then around

522
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
quarter four dashed off, you know,

523
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
started my iPod or download.

524
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
And here's the problem is I have to unsubscribe

525
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
from a whole bunch of stuff.

526
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Because I know that it's going to hit a feed

527
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
that I haven't received updates from for,

528
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
well, maybe three updates.

529
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
You know, I may have missed one dawn and

530
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
Rousseau, but I may have missed five

531
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
comonus reports.

532
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
I'd subscribe to not just the Gilmore

533
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
gang, but all of the IT conversations.

534
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
I had to unsubscribe because, you know,

535
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,860
IT conversations comes out with sometimes

536
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,860
two things a day.

537
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
And then it's just too much time.

538
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,860
I don't have time to fill my iPod.

539
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
The iPod or cannot fill fast enough,

540
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,860
even though the the link is really fast.

541
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
I have a team mobile link that I get at Starbucks.

542
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
I think it's probably a team mobile worldwide.

543
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
So the link is fast, but it's just,

544
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
I have too much subscribed to.

545
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,860
And so what I, what I wind up doing is I wind up

546
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,860
just checking the pod squad and getting there,

547
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,860
their latest podcast.

548
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
But anything else, I just don't have time for.

549
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,860
So we need some kind of switch, like a vacation switch,

550
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
or it has to sense that, you know,

551
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,860
yeah, although probably important

552
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,860
to get a whole week's worth of shows,

553
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,860
I'd like to have a switch to say,

554
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,860
just get the most recent one.

555
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
You know, I'm updating.

556
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,860
I've been away for a while.

557
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
I don't want to go back and,

558
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
and get everything that I've missed.

559
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
Just start fresh for me.

560
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,860
You know, start fresh with.

561
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
What's this?

562
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Oh, this is probably Lee Wilkins.

563
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,860
He's been bugging me.

564
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Hold on a second.

565
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Hey, Lee.

566
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Hey, I'm in the middle of the source code.

567
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
And that's okay.

568
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Can I call you back in,

569
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,860
let me see, like, what's that?

570
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,860
No, you don't.

571
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Who's this?

572
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
Hey, just hung up.

573
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
I thought it was Lee Wilkins.

574
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
I gave him this number.

575
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
I said, call me at 9 o'clock.

576
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
It's 9 o'clock.

577
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
It's 9 pm.

578
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Exactly.

579
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
The phone rings.

580
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
I pick up and I see a mobile number.

581
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,860
He says, look for a 079 mobile number.

582
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,860
And I'm just talking to this guy like he's Lee Wilkins and it's not.

583
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,860
All right.

584
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
That's too bad.

585
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,860
I probably go to got in a whole conversation going on with that guy.

586
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,860
All right.

587
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,860
So anyway, so back to that.

588
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
So there's some work that needs to be done,

589
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
because unless you're completely on the ball

590
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
and can, and can keep your,

591
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
your iPod are updated and your,

592
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
this guy's going to call again.

593
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
Watch on try it.

594
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Hello.

595
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
This is Corey.

596
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
This is Lee.

597
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,860
This is Lee.

598
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
Hey, good.

599
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,860
You know, I'm in the middle of the source code.

600
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,860
Can I?

601
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,860
It's funny because someone called like just 30 seconds before you.

602
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
And I pick up and say, hey, Lee, how you doing?

603
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,860
And it wasn't you.

604
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Someone who do dialed or completely wrong number.

605
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,860
It was, it was like, whoa, this phone never rings.

606
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
So can I call you back in like 15 minutes?

607
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Yeah.

608
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
No.

609
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,860
Good.

610
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Okay, dude.

611
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,860
Talk to you later.

612
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
Bye.

613
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,860
That's my nice phone interface.

614
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,860
How did it sound?

615
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
The sound like it's an air bridge,

616
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
because that's exactly what it was.

617
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
So okay.

618
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,860
Did you understand the issues with the, with the iPod or,

619
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,860
we need like a vacation button.

620
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
That's what we need.

621
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,860
When you go away, it has to,

622
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
it has to be able to reset and just say,

623
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
you know, basically I think what we're talking about here is

624
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,860
we need better content management for all of our podcasts.

625
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I'm, I talked to Dave and we're,

626
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
I'm really thinking about this idea of,

627
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
here's an OPML file.

628
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Here's, well, even that would be a cool way to use it.

629
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Wouldn't it?

630
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
So if I say, here's the pod squad.

631
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,860
Here's all the stuff that I want.

632
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
You know, here's my favorite shows.

633
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
And if you drag this file in,

634
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
it's going to subscribe to everything I guess.

635
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,860
What you could do is you could drag it out.

636
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,860
Or in an ideal world,

637
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,860
you take that OPML file with you and then you're on vacation

638
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,860
and drop it onto an iPod that's built into the stereo system

639
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
at your vacation address.

640
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,860
But of course, that's just me dreaming away, I guess.

641
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Okay, what do we have here?

642
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,860
We've got the Bob and AJ promo.

643
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,860
What the heck was that?

644
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Where is it?

645
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I'm firing this up from my system.

646
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Here is the Bob and AJ promo, everybody.

647
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Hey, Adam, it's Bob from the Bob and AJ show.

648
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,860
A new podcast out of Montreal featuring RIA free music

649
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,860
and banter from two guys who've known each other way too long.

650
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Anyways, here's the promo and just before I go in Canada,

651
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,860
we say Bo Weyer young and A.

652
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
This week, on the Bob and AJ show survivor, Father Ted,

653
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Danger Mouse, Phl từ blue, and Krill.

654
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Check it out, WWEW.phob AND AJ.

655
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
All right, there you go.

656
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
From up north.

657
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
And to wind it up for today,

658
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,860
as we do just about 37 minutes into the show,

659
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
I'm gonna do a little bit from the American Guide

660
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
speaking british.

661
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:43,500
figure. This is a wonderful web page that was sent to me. Let me see who sent that to me.

662
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,180
Almost second. Oh, shoot. I don't have it. Well, I have a link to the web page. And I have the list here.

663
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:56,060
So essentially, it's a whole bunch of words that you use in England, which have different

664
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,620
meaning than they would in the United States. So let's just start off with A. We'll do a couple.

665
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:07,340
And we'll do one or two every single day on the source code. So we start with A's. If something is

666
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,980
A's, it is brilliant. I used to hear a lot of Liverpool. Kids thought all cool stuff was A's or

667
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:21,660
Brill and Brill will get to, of course, we get to B. Agrow. Or should we say Agrow? Short for aggravation.

668
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,540
It's a sort of thing you might expect to football match. In other words, trouble. There is sometimes

669
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:34,940
Agrow in the cities after the pub shut. That will be closed in America. All right. I'll just do two more here.

670
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:40,780
All right. This is used a lot around London in the South to mean, hello. How are you? You would say

671
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,900
it to a complete stranger or someone you knew. The normal response will be for them to say,

672
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,500
All right, back to you. It is said as a question. Sometimes it might get expanded to,

673
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:57,500
All right. May, mostly used by blue collar workers, but also common among younger people. Okay. So

674
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,220
All right. I guess that's it. All right. All right. I do it. All right. I'm getting there. And then

675
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,500
this is my favorite anti anti clockwise. The first time I said that something had gone anti clockwise

676
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,300
to someone in Texas, I got this very funny look. It simply means counterclockwise, but must

677
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,420
sound really strange to you. Chaps. I think he thought I had something against clocks. This is

678
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:24,540
a whole set up. Of course, this whole list of words for Americans. Anti clockwise. It is indeed

679
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:30,780
true. They don't say counterclockwise, but anti clockwise. And then the final one here from the let's

680
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,980
do ours. Okay. That's a good one. Arse. Basically a word that doesn't seem to exist in America.

681
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,660
It means the same as asked, but as much rudder. It's used in phrases like pain in the offs,

682
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,580
and nuisance, or I can't be arse. I can't be bothered. Or you might hear something was

683
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,700
half arse, attempt. Meaning it was not done properly. And then there's my favorite of the day,

684
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,460
and we'll leave it at that. Arse about face. This means you are doing something back to front.

685
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,700
And that's the arse of the source code. Everybody?

686
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,540
We'll be back tomorrow with another edition. That will be the 30 days test of 10

687
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,860
more April 2 of November. There'll be December 1st edition of the daily source code.

688
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,900
Looking forward to that. Of course, your comments are welcome out of a query.com.

689
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,220
Send me those MP3 comments so I can download them at Starbucks and get them on the show. I really love them.

690
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,380
And you can always leave your comments on a weblawedlive.curry.com. And of course, we've got

691
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,180
the website where you can find the podcast team. We can find a little show in the archives.

692
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,820
The daily source code.com. I'll see you tomorrow here on the source code. Take care. Bye-bye.
