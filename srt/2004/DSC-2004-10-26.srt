1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I was due to the very source code every day.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,000
On Dragon Casting with Adam Curry.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The power of the door is going to go into it.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey there, good afternoon, everybody.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I mean, a mobile ride.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,500
It's the source code for Tuesday, October 26, 2004.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not a curry company to you from Flanders, Belgium.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's just a little past noon here, and we're podcasting from Curry Castle.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,400
I've been working a little bit on my audio levels today, of course, to show that when

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,000
I was yesterday, although it recorded without a hitch, was completely overmodulated.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
And what's nice about this little yep device that I got is that it didn't really crush

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,000
it well, what it did is it just limited the sound into one big tire, some thing, the

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
things too.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But working on all that, I know exactly what I need, I need a little portable mixture.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I had my eye on the long battery operated, and I can do everything all straight.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So I have the audio level set and so I can hear myself perfectly and create the podcast.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I said, it wasn't intended.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
On the show today, lots of cool bits found from around the podcast universe.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Some audio comments that came in and of course, some pod tunes for you, the non-R-A.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Non-R-I-A music that I've been scouring the internet for.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm still trying to get recruit people to send me their band stuff, and I have received

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
some stuff from people, but not all of it is particularly something I wanted to play on the

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
daily source code, meaning that somebody just was like, it was like real hobby stuff.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And it wasn't what I wanted to share with you.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm looking for some cool tunes and they're out there.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know they are, so we just got to get more people who are making music, interested in

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
podcasting what we're doing.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Actually, I guess I could talk about this right now because I received an email

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that in the most recent issue of wired magazine is a CD that comes packaged with

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
it's full of R-I-A-A free music released on the creative commons license, which is cool.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now, I found a podcast that actually has every single track from that CD on it.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, I'm going to take that with me today.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm driving up to the Netherlands for a couple of meetings in the old cash dance again,

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
right?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Gotta go to the airport.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we've already recorded that trip, so I decided to do the podcast early, but that's really cool

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that wired is jumping into this and think about that as distribution.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And have your tune on a CD distributed by wired magazine.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know what their circulation is, but it's got to be pretty damn cool.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the source code, always looking for cool stuff to play for you.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, they have played Burn, Goodie Stewart, Burn, Goodie Stewart, Burn by Royes Zimmerman

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
at Royes Zimmerman.com.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He has a nice political tune that he whipped up, and I wanted to share that with you right now.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This one's titled 90%.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:22,000
90% of likely voters have made up their minds.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Have made up their minds already.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And 80% of that other 10%

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
little states where they won't make a gosh-dark, bit of difference.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so they're spending 9085 million dollars

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to persuade 7 people in Ohio.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So if trans-section were to move to Cincinnati,

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and vote as a block, and rush off their chance.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This holy lecture could be decided by summer moments,

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
who become NASCARDES.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There you go.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
90% brought to you by Royes Zimmerman from Royes Zimmerman.com.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And as I'm also recruiting people who have got some music they want to promote on the show,

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we just send me a link to a URL where I can download it and some information and some background.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I've been scouring through different websites.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I really like GarageBand.com because not only does it give you a ranking of what users think,

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and users of that site think is really good in different categories.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The band has individual page and tells you whether they have a label or not,

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
whether you can download it or what the different licenses are, if applicable.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And there's lots of sites like that all around.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When I'm looking for, I guess, now, a lot of work goes into the source code.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It takes me about an hour to prep each day.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And of course, as I'm reading email, I'm always thinking,

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
oh, this is something I could do on the source code.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can use this.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
People are sending me audio comments.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Please keep those coming by the way.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I love them.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But I'd really like to do different types of music shows.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe there's a blue show of pod tunes that we can put together,

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
or maybe there's any different genre that you want.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But what I'm really looking for in that case is a producer.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I need someone who will basically use me as the voice for their show.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll be happy to produce it and put it all together.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So if you give me the MP3s that need to go into the show,

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
whatever show it is, as long as we see eye to eye on the type of music,

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
it'll be fun.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So I need for whatever if to weekly show,

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
which would make the most sense, I think.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I need the MP3s and the background information.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then I'll take care of all the rest.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And let's see if we can put something cool together.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That people would subscribe to a new music show.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But I need someone who's out there continuously scouring through everything

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and finding the stuff that's hot that people are talking about.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Really scouting some stuff.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So if you're interested in that, send them an email.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Adam at curry.com.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Maybe you've always wanted to do a podcast.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I can tell my microphone wires.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
My headphone wires hitting the mic wire.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe you want to do your own podcast,

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but maybe you don't like the way your voice sounds.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Maybe you just don't feel like doing that kind of stuff.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let me be your podcast whore.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So seriously, I'm looking for someone to help me produce something like that.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think that would be extremely cool.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
An email here from Geek News Central from Todd.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He says you talked about the Samsung yep.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But did not let us know which device she bought.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Also which one you ordered.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The one that has more options.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He said he also lost a show last week.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He's paranoid as hell about losing shows recorded on his computer.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I understand.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So maybe even if you're just using it as a backup device,

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it's good.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What I got Todd was the, I think of the box here.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's the yep 55 V.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's really ugly actually.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And it has, it's a brushed metal look, right?

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Which of course is anything but metal.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And the highlights, the accents are orange, if you can believe it.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So it's pretty lame looking.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And that's what I'm using currently.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But the one that I, I've ordered two of ordered.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And I river 790, which is very comparable to the Japanese thing that I have on order,

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
which is easy.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's digital Zen, X-E-N, digital Zen audio player.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And that thing is really awesome.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's, let's see.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It does MP3, MP1, 2.5,

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Windows Media, SF, AdVorbus.

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You know, it can, oh, what's really cool about this is it can,

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
it can import a text file.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And it'll do a text to speech.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I haven't heard the quality of that.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But, and it really lets you set the bit rates in, you know, much,

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
much more sophisticated fashion.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's got better IQs.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And you can look at that on www.easy-av.com.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So Echo Zulu-Alpha Victor.com.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's see.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's take it out to an audio comment that came in.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So what's this about?

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think this is about geocaching.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Adam, Mike from work for bandwith.blogspot.com here.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
MP3 mailing you from London, Ontario, Canada.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My friend Sarah and I were driving down the 401 highway in southwestern Ontario,

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
listening to your Friday, October 15 show.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Never do that with your girlfriend, man.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's just not a good idea.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And Sarah commented when you were talking about geocaching and podcasting,

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that she didn't really like the idea of other people telling her what she should

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
like and dislike without having some sort of credentials to give an informed opinion.

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think that she has a bit of a point if someone has a crappy experience in one restaurant

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
or in one city or one town shouldn't really shade the experience for everybody else,

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
especially if they have some sort of graduate that are not really letting on about it.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And also think a good idea to have a few unfiltered non-corporate opinions on something like that once in a while.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
As we made a way further down the highway towards Windsor,

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think we're talking about involved into a better idea of doing something like this.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Have things like the Zagat restaurant reviews or the AAA Auto Club,

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
travel books, have some sort of down-loadable MP3 content.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh man, you just mentioned like two things I'd love to see on RSS.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think that's where this comment is going.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was talking about geocaching and you could have enclosures attached to a geographical data,

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
GPS data, basically.

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And if you're in a certain spot or within a radius within a certain spot,

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it would fire off an MP3.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You could have a real walking tour of stuff.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But yeah, of course.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, anyone could set it up so you could have the review of good restaurants and bad restaurants.

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And everything is subjective of course.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But I like what you're saying here because you're talking about some great information flows

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that we just really need to have that would be perfect for any RSS.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Just text RSS.

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And that could be podcasted to you.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When you subscribe and very specific to the point of having up-to-date current restaurant reviews

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
for San Diego or Ben Breakfast outside of Boston,

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and be more up-to-date than the books that they pass out acting like a ratish eats or

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
addendums or something.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why don't have local tours boards get on side with us as well.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
When you go to maybe a expedient or travel-osity,

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
have them have some sort of content that they can propose to you for the local hotels.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
For example, if you can imagine subscribing to a last minute feature where someone actually describes,

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
or maybe, and of course, last people are talking about this as we move beyond podcasting.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The same infrastructural work for video, absolutely.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We don't quite have the platform of MP3 players for video yet,

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but it's coming because in my search for the perfect MP3 encoding device, external recording device,

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you know, I came up against the audio player and there's another one from Phillips,

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and there's some good stuff out there, man.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They're playing divics, and it's coming.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's happening, and it's happened pretty damn fast,

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and this on the day that Apple is releasing their new iPod,

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
right, the color iPod, and U2 is doing the whole shindig for that,

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
a lot of the marketing.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm hoping that, you know, if you have a color iPod,

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it might as well, well, shoot, you know, it might as well do video,

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
or at least, quick time, right?

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Just a thought, guys, we'll find out more as the day progresses.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And here for you, this is cool.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This came from OpenPodcast.org.

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's actually its OpenPodcast number 46.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I love this.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I hope it shows up every single day.

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's fabulous.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The podcaster's tap dance.

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
48% of those cool beliefs the president will be chosen by the courts,

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and the real winner will ultimately be frozen out of the job,

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
some fear there will be a riot.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Like in the catering ships, because the losing party won't fire.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Ashley Simpson's first number went fine on Saturday night,

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
live but the second song started singing before her lips arrived

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
in the position to match the words of the song.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So she's long off stage and said her bed played it wrong.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
57% of Americans have sex outdoors,

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
51% at sex on the first date.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
48% they don't get them, but they're not whores.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
12% at sex and work.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They couldn't wait.

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Halloween has been cancelled out of Washington State School,

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
because it takes time from their studies and the scientists

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
just so cool dirt the feelings of real life,

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
which is it makes them sad to sing up some blood

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and pointy hats and noses cackling at high pitches,

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
stay tuned for late breaking pop dates.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's the tap dance and podcaster news.

222
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's the podcasters tap dance here on the daily source code,

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and just have a visitor coming through,

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
a real estate agent checking out the value of the house.

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you right now is in the bars.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
A bed is writing down that it's very extensive bar studio area of the house.

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If you start up, I'm going to show you the book.

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm going to show you the book.

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to show you the book.

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Let's see, we gotta go out now to New Zealand

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
where we have a comment about metadata.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey, I didn't miss a mark from New Zealand here.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I didn't actually think I'd record a comment,

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
but I'm just out driving recording this on my P100.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know if I'll be able to get this off the phone

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
to send it to you, but whatever.

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, I just had this pretty cool thought.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was just thinking about trackbacks, web laws and podcasting.

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I just, I had the sight here that we're losing metadata here.

240
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I was looking to the source code earlier.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And you're playing these different excerpts from different tasks

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that you've found that are really interesting.

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And I sometimes, you know, paid up.

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're really cool to listen to the full thing.

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But I don't know if any, I don't know where these speeds are,

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
or where these files are.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know whether I already haven't downloaded or whatever.

248
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Now, thinking what would be cool is this,

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you had additional enclosures listed in your cast.

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So that there's a police car, I don't know if he's,

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
nope, he's not following me.

252
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah, that you have additional enclosures in your cast and your feed.

253
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's say, hey, I referenced the source.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So then I potter can also download these additional files

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that you have referenced so that I can listen to them in their entirety.

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That would be really cool,

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
because I wouldn't have to hunt them down.

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And then I was thinking you can extend whatever I pot,

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I pot blanks off or this is an open medium,

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
to actually listen to these media.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, so that'd be quite cool.

262
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So then you can just, yeah, that would be very cool.

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And actually, I was thinking about that mark,

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
while I was taking a shower earlier today.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And then it hit me, it's so simple.

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm already using radio user land or actually combination of radio user land

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and manila, but all based on the frontier application.

268
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's what I'm going to use to create the perfect podcast production system.

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And this is, I've been looking for, you know,

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
a next mission in podcasting.

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And of course, I'm loving it making the podcast.

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm looking, you know, to do more shows

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
if people will help me produce them.

274
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm really excited about that, because, you know,

275
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
it's a matter of just, you know, getting through the show

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and putting the love and the passion into it

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
because of part of the music.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But really, I've been wanting to contribute more.

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And you know, I'm not a programmer, right?

280
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We all got that down.

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I wonder if anyone out there is still using my original iPod or Apple script.

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I doubt it.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But I've done a fair amount of user land scripting in my time.

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Just ask Dave Winner, he's saying,

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I've done shit with his software that isn't technically possible,

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and it's perfectly suited for radio production.

287
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I use it on my morning radio show,

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but more as a content management system.

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But now you're right.

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know, we're talking about things like metadata.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And it should be as simple as, you know,

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
me dropping my sample clips into a folder

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that's where it should pick up, you know, feeds and details

294
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
because we just strip out the RSS.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You know, all of this stuff can be done.

296
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And well, for Christ's sake,

297
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
the application is called radio.

298
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I mean, was this foresight or what?

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I mean, it's perfect.

300
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's going to be perfect.

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And I'm quite sure that, you know, we can then start

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
to connect our production systems.

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You know, I can export stuff.

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And this can all flow into the directory.

305
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And, oh, lions and tigers.

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, you know, all that shit.

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, my.

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's going to be great.

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It really, really is.

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm looking forward to this.

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So, a great idea.

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll play it just the end of his voice mail note

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
because he gets so wrapped up in his metadata.

314
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Listen to the source code already here.

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's quite long here.

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He gets lost.

317
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I said, hey, I want to listen to that full thing.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That would be so cool.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm also thinking about trackbacks.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If I go to this original source medium,

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and then I might get an enclosure to say, hey,

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Adam Curry also left a comment on this and made a commentary.

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So then I get those them.

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And you just get this full big circular blow out of bandwidth.

325
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah.

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've got a, I've got a shoot.

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I lost.

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Kind of got lost in this car.

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm going to go to a fine room going.

330
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But I'm, yeah, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, be great.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Geocast that where you got lost and put that audio comment in there.

333
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Perfect.

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Great idea.

335
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And thank you for the inspiration because.

336
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Excuse me.

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's exactly where I'm going to go.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And it's going to be on the next two months.

339
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And also frontier is open source now.

340
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So we could, and it's cross platform.

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So Mac and Windows.

342
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I use it every single day.

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I already use it for a lot of my podcast production.

344
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So it makes so much sense to do this.

345
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then we can actually, you know, like,

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
bake applications that would, you know,

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
be open source and available for people to,

348
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to build off on and use.

349
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And we can tie all this shit together.

350
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And, yeah, it's great.

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's great.

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In fact, it's, it's, it's wonderful.

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's, it's wonderful.

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I have a song that, that kind of,

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
sags right into that from grudgeband.com.

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And this is good.

357
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The history of hip hop.

358
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Drama, teek, and then flow.

359
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Did it?

360
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're now too dead to American movie classics.

361
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Today's feature presentation.

362
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Wonderful.

363
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Tell me.

364
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Can you tell me where hip hop is like,

365
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
back in the day?

366
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well,

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
it's a whole lot different to what it's like now.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It was wonderful.

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Listen.

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hey, yo.

371
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We're love, baby.

373
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We send this opportunity to tie your pop community.

374
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We brought to the store this culture back to where they used to be.

375
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No, I'm sad.

376
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Back when it was wonderful.

377
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Come and yo.

378
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Back in the day, it was nothing like that.

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000

The tables kind of creaking here.

504
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Hey, crap, man. We all got the same problems.

505
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
All right, so I'll just try to hold still.

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Anyway, this is Brian here in Colorado.

508
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And I just happened to pass this whole

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
podcasting thing here.

510
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Well, just in the past couple days

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I was really impressed with it.

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Your stuff in particular isn't really interesting.

513
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And just the level of professionalism really

514
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
boiling.

515
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Well, it sets the bar pretty high for all the other folks getting involved in this stuff.

516
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So anyway,

517
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
well, you were noting in some of the other folks at the Gilmore gang.

518
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Everybody seems to really think this stuff

519
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is really taking off like crazy

520
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and all the cultural implications

521
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
are well, it seemed to be pretty far reaching.

522
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
One thing I was particularly impressed with

523
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and this lead into my question for you is a lot of the NPR stuff that kind of

524
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
is starting to show up.

525
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Stuff a future tense.

526
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And also the morning stories from WGBH.

527
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's really type of stuff that I typically listen to on the radio.

528
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And so, well, I guess my question for you is

529
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
a lot of this stuff from NPR and other sources

530
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
has been showing up on audible.com

531
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and also consequently because of that

532
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
in the iTunes music store.

533
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And of course, when you download that,

534
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
you can put that onto your iPod

535
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and I'm sure other devices as well.

536
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And take it portably.

537
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And so a lot of shows like Cartoc,

538
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
this American life, and stuff like that.

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
People download pay for it

540
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and they get to enjoy it.

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Arguably, podcasting has an edge

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
on that content and do the fact

543
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
that you get to tie it in with the RSS feeds,

544
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
which is pretty cool.

545
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But then again, you know,

546
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
audible.com gets it stuff on iTunes.

547
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Music stores, of course it's got, you know,

548
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
it had started into that.

549
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Well, let me just stop there for a second, Brian,

550
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
because it's, you know, that's exactly right.

551
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is exactly what audible

552
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and Apple should be listening to

553
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because audible actually has subscription programs,

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
you know, like fresh air

555
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
as you say a couple of NPR programs.

556
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And some of them are free.

557
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't think you have to pay

558
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
from most of the public radio stuff.

559
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
In fact, there was an interview with John Stewart

560
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
on there that I believe it was free.

561
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But it doesn't matter, you know,

562
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
why doesn't audible make subscriptions

563
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
available?

564
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They already know how to do the money part,

565
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
because they're happy to take my

566
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
buck amount to whatever it is that I pay for fresh air,

567
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
maybe it's even a little bit more,

568
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
you pay upfront actually, I think.

569
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So then just give me an RSS feed,

570
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
you know, that I can subscribe to it.

571
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's, you know,

572
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
your DRM stuff won't let me copy it anyway.

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So, you know, the,

574
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the file presumably is useless for anyone else.

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And, you know, you can do all kinds of authentication.

576
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yes, that's exactly right.

577
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And so should iTunes music store,

578
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
just be doing exactly the same thing.

579
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You know, let me subscribe to a podcast

580
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and then, you know,

581
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
shit, they own the whole platform,

582
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
make a button that I click somewhere

583
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and it just orders it for me.

584
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know, oh, yes, it makes so much sense.

585
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Particularly with,

586
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I wouldn't be cool if today

587
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
during the announcement of the new iPod,

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
someone mentioned podcasting,

589
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
wouldn't that be, wouldn't it be awesome?

590
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It could happen.

591
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It could happen.

592
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
If it does, you'll,

593
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
you'll know about it tomorrow.

594
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That's for sure.

595
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay, now let's go over to Ryan from Oklahoma City

596
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
who's excited about podcasting.

597
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey Adam,

598
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
this is Ryan,

599
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
a loyal source code listener

600
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
from Oklahoma City

601
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
in a recent transplant

602
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
from Dave Weiner country

603
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
out in Seattle.

604
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And, you know,

605
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
when I left Seattle,

606
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
one of the things I was looking forward to

607
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
most was escaping the traffic,

608
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
which is absolutely horrendous out there.

609
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And today,

610
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
on my way home from work out here,

611
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in Oklahoma,

612
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
it was major,

613
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Seattle flashback time

614
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
because we had traffic

615
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
backed up from majors.

616
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm like,

617
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the ageu,

618
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but it, for miles,

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
it took me an hour and a half to get home.

620
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Something about it,

621
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
check from Wisconsin

622
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
with pink hair

623
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
doing iPod poetry

624
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
on the i35.

625
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm not sure what was going on there.

626
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
On Don and Drew.

627
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Anyway,

628
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I freaking love

629
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
bumper to bumper today,

630
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
man.

631
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I had my iPod packed

632
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
to the gills with podcast,

633
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
not a moment of my commute was wasted.

634
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I got my daily source code

635
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
fix.

636
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I got a few laughs in

637
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
with Don and Drew.

638
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And I checked in with

639
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Como 1000 news from

640
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Back home in Seattle.

641
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I loved every

642
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
minute of it, man.

643
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I would like to give

644
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
a thank you to you

645
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
for the source code

646
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and for all of your

647
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
effort on podcasting.

648
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Bye.

649
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Bye.

650
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Bye.

651
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I always sound effects

652
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
provided for free,

653
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
my friend.

654
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And I'd like to give

655
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the listeners

656
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
of the source code

657
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a big boy.

658
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
A little iTunes tip

659
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
that helps me manage my content.

660
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I have created a smart play list

661
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
with two parameters.

662
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
One genre contains

663
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
podcast.

664
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And two play count

665
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
equals zero.

666
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So that as my content

667
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
is downloaded to the iPod,

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
my smart play list

669
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
appropriately enough

670
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
titled new podcasts

671
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
is populated.

672
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And as I listen to each show,

673
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
it's kicked off

674
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
the new podcasts list

675
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
so that when I come back

676
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
to my iPod later,

677
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and I'm scrolling and searching

678
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
for what I'm going to look

679
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
through next,

680
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I do not have to

681
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
contend with shows

682
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that I've already listened to.

683
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And it just makes it a

684
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
little bit easier

685
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
to get through all of that

686
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
awesome content.

687
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So out of my hope,

688
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I get a podcast

689
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
coming to you

690
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000

So take it easy

697
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
All right.

700
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000

movement.

703
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's my point behind

704
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
writing from Oklahoma City,

705
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and he was talking about

706
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Don Andru in that

707
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
audio commentary

708
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and I encourage you to

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000

717
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And don Andru

718
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,840
are back on the air

719
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,000
They were off because of a

720
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
bandwidth issue,

721
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and I was listening

722
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
to their the most recent show

723
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and the subject of David

724
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Bowie came up

725
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
as they were talking

726
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
about the freak show

727
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
that they went to see.

728
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,720
This is as an example for like the perfect length show.

729
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,520
All right enough talking about that.

730
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Okay.

731
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,520
So we saw a free show tonight at Fred Bust.

732
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:19,200
Um, a fat man got half naked, a cute man jumped on glass in ugly man, stapled money

733
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,480
to his body, and a total fucking loser ate a baby rat.

734
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
That was nasty.

735
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,240
That one guy also stuck a pin right through his arm.

736
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Yeah.

737
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,400
Any eight fire, but this does leave the devil.

738
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,640
And then your cute guy also did the little deal with the ball.

739
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,920
Oh man, that was fucking hot.

740
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
What is it called?

741
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,240
Um, David Bowie, Labyrinth shit.

742
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Yeah.

743
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
I don't know.

744
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,040
We're going to have the producer look it up.

745
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,360
Yeah, that looks really cool.

746
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
He totally had it down.

747
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,160
So you guys seen Labyrinth, right?

748
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,080
And it's not really David Bowie, it's somebody else.

749
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Doing the glass balls.

750
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,080
He's like, turn on bucks, Sarah.

751
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,560
Man, when I saw that, I think I was like eight, and I literally was like, my private

752
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
two weird.

753
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,920
And I had a thing for David Bowie ever since.

754
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,960
And for some reason, I don't know why I had this idea.

755
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Um, I thought David Bowie was a vampire.

756
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
It's a real?

757
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Yeah, like.

758
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,480
So I had this whole eight-year-old sexual fan, as you know, you've got to wear a weird

759
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
wife, man.

760
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,520
That he would come into my room late at night and bite me on the neck and then we could

761
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,320
be vampires together.

762
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,120
So I would sleep with my neck exposed so that when David Bowie came by to bite me, it

763
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,840
was easier.

764
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,520
It didn't really occur to me that, you know.

765
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,120
Had you ever seen the hunger?

766
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,400
No.

767
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
I still haven't.

768
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
What?

769
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Yeah.

770
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,000
I've seen the movie The Hunger.

771
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I haven't.

772
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What's the vampire?

773
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,280
I've never seen it.

774
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
I think we might own it on tape.

775
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
No, I don't.

776
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
We might.

777
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,080
That's a good movie, the bow house, in the beginning.

778
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,080
The producer's giving me some notes on the hunger.

779
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,760
Um, yeah, so David Bowie, I'm totally fuck you.

780
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,480
You're my mom's gonna kick your ass.

781
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
I could shake her.

782
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,240
My mom's gonna kick your ass.

783
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,840
Maybe your boyfriend knows him.

784
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,680
I could totally use Adam Craig into the movie.

785
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Wait.

786
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,120
So yeah, right, Benz was fun.

787
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
We went.

788
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Okay, so.

789
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
So, you know.

790
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,360
Well, on the second.

791
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
So, oops, sorry.

792
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,200
Don has this David Bowie thing ever since she was eight.

793
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,640
Yes, you're totally doing, and she wants to get in contact with him.

794
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,400
I've met David Bowie a couple times, but source code listeners, something that I haven't

795
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,120
spoken about before on the show, is that a long time ago, well, now, first I got to

796
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,040
say that Patricia, my wife, we've been married for 15 years.

797
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,600
We've been together for 17 years.

798
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,760
She's a little bit older than I am.

799
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,120
She's a 55, I'm 40, so she's 15 years older than I am.

800
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,920
Although, she likes it to be like 14 years, you know.

801
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,680
So right now, it's the difference actually 14 years, because I just turned 40 in, you know,

802
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,680
anyway.

803
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
It doesn't matter.

804
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,480
It's, in fact, the older you get, the less it matters, right?

805
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,160
But she knows David Bowie, intimately, I believe, from the 70s.

806
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,240
So I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

807
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,240
See, 34 minutes on the clock, so we could talk about this for at least six minutes.

808
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,800
Let's see if I can find your Oscar Teller David Bowie story.

809
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,880
Anja, it's Patricia airs in the room.

810
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Hi.

811
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,880
Yeah, I'm becoming a boy.

812
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,320
She's the only one who's on the floor, right?

813
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Yeah, I'm getting my balloons for life, I'm getting my yay.

814
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Yeah, I'm out.

815
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,080
I have new folks, Marka.

816
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Yeah.

817
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm coming to Casa.

818
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
Yeah, I'm ready for you right now.

819
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm taping as we speak.

820
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,440
Oh, I'm coming to my studio.

821
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,680
I'm coming to your studio.

822
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,040
Yeah?

823
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,080
Everyone's really excited now.

824
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,680
Oh, they're listening.

825
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Yeah, they're waiting, because, you know, they're waiting to hear.

826
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,840
Your David Bowie story.

827
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,680
She's a boy.

828
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,320
So this guy is appraising the house for,

829
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,200
because the other people need to get a mortgage.

830
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,480
Yeah.

831
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
The fuck is that?

832
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Okay.

833
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,120
Coming to the, coming to my, into the source code studio.

834
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,920
This is my, oh, come on, Jess.

835
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
All right, everybody.

836
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,200
Ever bought it?

837
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,080
I'll sit with you here, because I got this idea.

838
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,280
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna put the mic in the middle,

839
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,720
so it ends out.

840
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
So I can listen on the headphones.

841
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Now you can sit there, if not, sit over there.

842
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,520
Yeah, hold on.

843
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,560
There you go.

844
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,960
And then we'll put the headphones on, so I can listen.

845
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
Okay, let me.

846
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
Well, you have to interview me.

847
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,200
Yes.

848
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,040
Okay.

849
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,640
Hi there.

850
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,960
Hey, you're really cute.

851
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,800
I thought you were ready.

852
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
Are you a lesbian?

853
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,320
God.

854
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Okay, so.

855
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm every woman.

856
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Yes, okay.

857
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,200
All right, so Patricia's my wife.

858
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,080
I already explained that you're just a little bit older than I am,

859
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,560
so you have some more of some better stories from early days.

860
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,080
They think you are older if they see us to get it.

861
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,680
Yeah, of course.

862
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,200
Yeah, explain.

863
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,040
Yes.

864
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,840
Yeah, because I look like shit,

865
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
and you look very beautiful.

866
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm firm.

867
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,480
Very firm.

868
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,320
And I'm sad.

869
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
My ass is sad.

870
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,440
Yeah, but you're still in a chair.

871
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,440
We've your left up on your left.

872
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
But do you love me?

873
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Yeah, I do love you.

874
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,280
Okay.

875
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,920
So when did you, let me just jump right into the conversation.

876
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,680
When did you meet David Bowie?

877
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,880
And what you do remember what year it was?

878
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,720
I think it was round about 1969.

879
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,920
1969?

880
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
I was five.

881
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
I know.

882
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,600
And you were, so you were like 1920 years old?

883
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,080
I was 19 years old.

884
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,040
And in these days, you had those song contest,

885
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,240
festivals.

886
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,800
You had to go to.

887
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Well, what do you mean you had to go to?

888
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,280
Well, if you want to be famous, and if you want to.

889
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,880
You're really cute when you're in a film store.

890
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,240
If you want to be famous, or do you want a real career,

891
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,840
you had to do these things.

892
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
So it was something else.

893
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,440
It was something else.

894
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,920
Like the Eurovision Song Contest, like that.

895
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
It's a sort of, yeah.

896
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,840
But then it was held in lovely places.

897
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Oh, you know, when they still had budget.

898
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,800
Yes, if they had budget, beautiful, big orchestras, like 40

899
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
piece orchestras.

900
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,120
Oh, okay.

901
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,960
So it was lovely.

902
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,640
You know, you never knew what happened.

903
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,520
And so, you know, it was the best thing to do.

904
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,880
Okay.

905
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
So I went to Malta.

906
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Malta.

907
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,520
Malta.

908
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Lovely.

909
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,160
Malta.

910
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,840
Never been there.

911
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,960
It was very beautiful, very sort of a rabie, a rabie,

912
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,760
a rabie and kind of, yeah, sort of that.

913
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,200
And in much people, they were the same.

914
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,640
Yeah, lots of English people.

915
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,960
So probably that's why we all had to go there.

916
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,720
So you had a Germany Austria, you were representing the Netherlands.

917
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,520
And I was representing the Netherlands.

918
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,000
And there he was.

919
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,320
It was David Jones.

920
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
David Jones.

921
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,600
He wasn't even David Bowen?

922
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
No, no.

923
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
That doesn't count.

924
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
That wasn't David.

925
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
David Jones.

926
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
David Jones.

927
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
David Jones.

928
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
And he was representing the...

929
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,000
He was, he was more old.

930
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,800
But he was for England, of course.

931
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,680
And he had these...

932
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,080
What is this guy's name?

933
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Who did the Beatles?

934
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
George Martin.

935
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,480
Yes, he had George Martin.

936
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,720
He was producing him.

937
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,040
He was his, yeah, and his musical director.

938
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,840
Everybody has his head as his own music.

939
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Oh, okay.

940
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,680
It was way sheaker then then they're doing now.

941
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
This is the point.

942
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
This is the point.

943
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I don't know.

944
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
100 million people watching.

945
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
It was beautiful.

946
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,120
It was all over Europe on TV.

947
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,920
It was, you know, it was very important.

948
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,560
Were you already selling albums at this point?

949
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Yes.

950
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:13,400
Every, what they did was every country sent their biggest talent, or it's a talent

951
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,240
that they think, you know, it's going to, that could be a very big star.

952
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Okay.

953
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
But you were already a star.

954
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,360
I was in Holland already starting my career and selling records.

955
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
So, okay.

956
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
It sent me to Malta and...

957
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Did you like the drink?

958
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
No.

959
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
I have coffee.

960
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Okay.

961
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:39,160
So, when I met David was, okay, there were no many very hip people there, and I was very

962
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
hip.

963
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Right.

964
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
It was all sick of shit.

965
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,160
It was now most of them were a little bit, yeah, a little bit of a kind of...

966
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,760
Well, but this was the end of the 60s, so it was like, where you were hippies?

967
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Crowners and I know.

968
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Were you smoking dope?

969
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,560
Uh, yeah, I probably, you know, coming from Holland.

970
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Don't remember.

971
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Sure.

972
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
I don't remember.

973
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
I never remember.

974
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
Yes, we, I never remember.

975
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,360
But so David probably picked me out because he thought, well, that, Jake looks cool.

976
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,760
So I hang out with her.

977
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Look at him.

978
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Oh, you're blind me.

979
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Look at them.

980
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Who does?

981
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
So he was telling me about his new girlfriend that he has.

982
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
She was an actor.

983
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
And she looked a lot like Barbara Stranger.

984
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Wait, Angie was that Angie?

985
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
That was Angie.

986
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Oh, no.

987
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
She looks a lot like Barbara Stranger.

988
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,560
She looks like Barbara Stranger.

989
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,760
She looks like Barbara Stranger.

990
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
She has her own.

991
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Yeah.

992
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
She has her own.

993
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
She has her own.

994
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
She was a young, uh, Barbara Stranger.

995
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,760
And she was a great actress.

996
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,560
He saw that.

997
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,160
Yeah.

998
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,560
He thought, uh, the character of Broadway.

999
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,160
Yeah.

1000
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
But he was probably in love.

1001
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
So he was involved.

1002
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,560
He was doing a boyfriend at this time.

1003
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,560
I was, I guess, I, yeah, I had a boyfriend.

1004
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Yeah.

1005
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
But in these days, you look like Barbara Stranger?

1006
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
No.

1007
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Yeah.

1008
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Down there.

1009
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Oh, yeah.

1010
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Yeah.

1011
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,160
But in these days, when you were a hippie, it didn't matter.

1012
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,160
If you, if you just met nice people, you hang out with them.

1013
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,960
There was no age, you know, you could make love or, uh, yeah,

1014
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,760
and it was great.

1015
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
I told you so.

1016
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,560
I don't love them.

1017
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,960
And no, you, you, you hated when I tell you that.

1018
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,160
Yeah.

1019
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,160
We had to wear like, you know, truck tires.

1020
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Yeah.

1021
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,960
I know.

1022
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,360
But in these days, now, you could make love.

1023
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,160
And the only thing you had to do is maybe protect yourself a little bit.

1024
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,160
But, you know, for being, for getting pregnant, actually.

1025
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,760
For getting pregnant.

1026
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,160
Nobody was thinking about anything.

1027
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,760
So everybody was a hornier's house.

1028
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,760
And, uh, so we hang out a little bit.

1029
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
And we, you know, and we had fun.

1030
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,160
But although I thought, I didn't think he was sexy at all.

1031
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,560
He didn't look sexy at all.

1032
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,760
He was very strange.

1033
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,760
He was, he was, uh, skitt, guitar was hanging around his neck

1034
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
the whole day.

1035
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
And he was playing it.

1036
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
And, and, uh, everybody said,

1037
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
oh, can you please tell the guy to stop?

1038
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
What was he playing?

1039
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
What was he playing?

1040
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Oh, sort of things.

1041
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Um, so we went to the, I remember.

1042
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
We went to for a walk on the beach.

1043
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,760
And, um, he was singing songs for me,

1044
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
because he was making an introduction.

1045
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Probably.

1046
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,760
He was trying to make an impression.

1047
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
And we was quite boring.

1048
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
And what song was he playing?

1049
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,760
He was playing, um, I remember.

1050
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
He said, do you like this song?

1051
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Listen, I'm going to play.

1052
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I thought I heard it already.

1053
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
But, okay.

1054
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,760
And he played round control to Major Tom.

1055
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,760
And I, and I thought, oh, man.

1056
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
And it never ended.

1057
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
And, uh, he was based on it.

1058
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Yeah.

1059
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
And he was in the record.

1060
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,760
And he said to me, don't you think I sound like John Lennon?

1061
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Oh, really?

1062
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Yeah, he thought he sounded like John Lennon.

1063
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
That's what it was.

1064
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
He was a big idol.

1065
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Yeah.

1066
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
He wanted to sound like it.

1067
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
But for him, he wasn't a star yet,

1068
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
but he was actually, I think they sent it

1069
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
because I thought there was something going on.

1070
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
But we don't know what.

1071
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
She did for color eyes.

1072
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,760
So, and he said, I just got a, um, a record to deal.

1073
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,760
And, uh, that's probably going to record this song.

1074
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,760
And I thought, man, I hated already.

1075
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
It sounded horrible.

1076
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,760
And it, and you had to see him because he was,

1077
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,760
he was, he was not wearing swimming trunks or anything.

1078
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Yeah.

1079
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
He was wearing diapers.

1080
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Yeah.

1081
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
He had sort of, you know, he wanted to be different.

1082
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
And that's, you know, he still does.

1083
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
He was wearing diaper.

1084
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
He was so different from the rest.

1085
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
He was wearing a sort of, you know,

1086
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,760
what you see when, when Jesus, you know,

1087
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
you see in the Bible.

1088
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Like drawing cloth?

1089
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Yeah.

1090
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Yeah.

1091
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Yeah.

1092
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Really?

1093
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
So, sort of, it looked like a diaper.

1094
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Like a Roman thing or just,

1095
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
No, nothing on.

1096
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
He was very skinny.

1097
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Very pale.

1098
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
He looked like a turtle.

1099
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
He liked it.

1100
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
He just liked it up.

1101
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
You know, he was so white.

1102
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
And, and, and brown.

1103
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
And brown.

1104
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
The whole day.

1105
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
And I thought, man.

1106
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Stop.

1107
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
Stop.

1108
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,760
So, um, and he tried, and of course he tried to kiss me.

1109
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
You know, these things.

1110
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Wait, what was it?

1111
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Did he have the orange hair?

1112
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Was that the Ziggy hair?

1113
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
No.

1114
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
No.

1115
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Just blonde hair.

1116
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Nothing.

1117
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
Nothing.

1118
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
No.

1119
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,760
He was not attractive at all.

1120
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
Yeah.

1121
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
Now he always had.

1122
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
And it's teeth were like horrible.

1123
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Horrible.

1124
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Horrible.

1125
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
One, two, three.

1126
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,760
You were even considering kissing that mouth.

1127
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Well, I kissed a little, but I thought,

1128
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
Geez, no.

1129
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
And you could feel like the jagged edges against your tongue.

1130
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Yeah, I guess so.

1131
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I guess so.

1132
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
And then I remember his girlfriend.

1133
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I said, yeah, my American girlfriend is coming over.

1134
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
And, like, she's very nice.

1135
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
And we could have.

1136
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
We could get together.

1137
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
We could get together.

1138
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Yeah.

1139
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
And maybe have a trio.

1140
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Oh, maybe she's so much.

1141
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Yeah.

1142
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
And I thought, geez.

1143
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
And I saw her coming.

1144
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Oh, no.

1145
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
Not Barbara Streisand.

1146
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,760
So they were trying and trying with nothing happens.

1147
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,760
So, but years later, when I was really, really famous.

1148
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Well, that was that.

1149
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
It was the song festival.

1150
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
And he didn't win.

1151
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
I didn't win.

1152
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I don't know.

1153
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
It's not like that.

1154
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
No, no.

1155
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
He was not.

1156
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
He tried.

1157
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,760
And he was actually.

1158
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,760
Trying the whole time that I was there.

1159
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Yeah.

1160
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I was way too pretty for him.

1161
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,760
And he was a star.

1162
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
And he had a shitties.

1163
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
No, no, no.

1164
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
He was not a star.

1165
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
So what happened was after that.

1166
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,760
It was really a hit.

1167
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,760
Yeah.

1168
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,760
Yeah.

1169
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
He came in.

1170
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
He thought, that's a song.

1171
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,760
That's a song.

1172
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
That's a fucking song.

1173
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
The whole day.

1174
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Yeah.

1175
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,760
So a couple years later after he had a couple of hits.

1176
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Yeah.

1177
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
There was the.

1178
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Is that the question?

1179
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
Yeah.

1180
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
When he had his first hit, he think,

1181
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Yeah.

1182
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Should have done him.

1183
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1184
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,760
But then then he had, after one hit that red hair.

1185
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
And he started, came out and everything.

1186
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
Yeah.

1187
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,760
And I had to do a big event that is, that was every year.

1188
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
That's called Kangala Dudes.

1189
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Kangala Dudes.

1190
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Yeah.

1191
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
It's a great gala.

1192
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,760
No.

1193
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
It's an Amsterdam.

1194
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
And it was very famous.

1195
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Very wide was there.

1196
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Adobe Gray, the three degrees.

1197
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,760
So this was like 74, 75, maybe?

1198
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
Yeah, I see.

1199
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
So no, 74.

1200
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
74.

1201
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
And the grandgala Dudes.

1202
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,760
And they asked me and my sister because we were also doing a lot of backing vocals,

1203
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,760
because we were in the best backing vocals you can get to back up to back up some

1204
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
some ex from America.

1205
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Yeah.

1206
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,760
You guys were cute.

1207
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
And we were very cute.

1208
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,760
And so we did it was a big orchestra there.

1209
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
And very wide.

1210
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,760
We had to do the backing vocals for very wide.

1211
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,760
His backing vocals, but they couldn't sing that well.

1212
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,760
So we were behind the curtains doing them.

1213
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,760
Yeah.

1214
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,760
We backed up.

1215
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
Yeah.

1216
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
Doing the backing up them.

1217
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,760
And we did some backing vocals for the three degrees.

1218
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
Just to make it a little bit fuller.

1219
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Because when they, you know, on the record sounds better.

1220
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,760
But that was like a real honor because that was cool.

1221
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
We thought it was good cake.

1222
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
Yeah.

1223
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
And it was fun.

1224
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
It was very musical.

1225
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Yeah.

1226
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,760
You know, you were on star.

1227
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Yeah.

1228
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,760
Sure.

1229
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,760
And then I was standing.

1230
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,760
We had to do a couple of things in front of the solo stage.

1231
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,760
So the audience could see us.

1232
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,760
And I knew I heard that David Bowie came in.

1233
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Because he was one of the guests too.

1234
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,760
He was performing on the show.

1235
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Now he was performing somewhere in our Amsterdam.

1236
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,760
But he was a guest in the audience.

1237
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
And what is wife?

1238
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
You sure you don't want to drink a water?

1239
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
No, no, no, no.

1240
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
You want to take a sip of coffee?

1241
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
Yeah, I'm so cute.

1242
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,760
You never told it.

1243
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,760
Oh, you're dribbling.

1244
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,760
You're so excited about David.

1245
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
Yeah.

1246
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Yeah.

1247
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Yeah.

1248
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
Now.

1249
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
So I was working.

1250
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,760
And he probably saw me standing there and said to Angie, isn't that?

1251
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
There's a picture that we met a couple of years ago.

1252
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
We met a couple of years ago.

1253
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Yeah.

1254
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,760
She thinks he's lesbian, but she's stuck out for me.

1255
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,760
Let's go.

1256
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,760
Let's go snobber.

1257
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,760
So afterwards there was a drink, of course, with all the stars.

1258
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
And this was still the seven.

1259
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
And I was walking around there.

1260
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,760
And I bumped into him and he said,

1261
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,760
I thought he was you.

1262
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,760
How are you?

1263
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
Oh, it's so good to see you.

1264
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,760
And you look so pretty.

1265
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
And even pretty.

1266
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
I don't know.

1267
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,760
I didn't fix it.

1268
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,760
Very hot.

1269
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Very hot.

1270
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,760
Because he was, you know, he was sick.

1271
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,760
He started with his suit.

1272
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,760
So he had the orange hair.

1273
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,760
It was here.

1274
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
And he had this little thing over his suit.

1275
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
He had that out of the party.

1276
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,760
Yes.

1277
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,760
No way.

1278
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Because you know why?

1279
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,760
Because he told me later.

1280
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
Because he had a hat.

1281
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,760
No one of his, you know, one of his eyes had a cataract.

1282
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,760
Yeah, something.

1283
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Something.

1284
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Because one of the, you know,

1285
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
The different color.

1286
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
The different color.

1287
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,760
There was something going on.

1288
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,760
Cool.

1289
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,760
So that wasn't just a section.

1290
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
So it was not even.

1291
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
But it looked.

1292
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,760
Of course.

1293
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,760
Yeah.

1294
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
And the teeth were still fucked up.

1295
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,760
Yeah.

1296
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
These were still crooked.

1297
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,760
Not anymore.

1298
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,760
I've seen.

1299
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,760
Yeah.

1300
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,760
But it was wonderful.

1301
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah.

1302
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah.

1303
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
That's why it's.

1304
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
I think she demanded to do.

1305
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
Yeah.

1306
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
He said do.

1307
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
I'm not going to run.

1308
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
I have a baby.

1309
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
I think this is the time.

1310
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
Fix your teeth.

1311
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
So.

1312
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Um.

1313
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Uh.

1314
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Someone said, we met each other.

1315
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
And he said, you would,

1316
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
Would you like to come to the hotel and have a drink with me?

1317
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
So we had downstairs.

1318
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,760
We had a drink in the lobby.

1319
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
And Angie was there too.

1320
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
But in the meanwhile,

1321
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,760
I heard and I've seen a little bit of it.

1322
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,760
And he had quite a fight with the Angie downstairs.

1323
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
She was very drunk.

1324
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
As she said, I'm so pissed.

1325
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,760
Right.

1326
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
I'm so pissed.

1327
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
And yeah.

1328
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Yeah.

1329
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Yeah.

1330
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,760
Yeah.

1331
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,760
I'm pissed.

1332
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,760
Now pissed.

1333
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
And she behaved horribly.

1334
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
Because she's, she's a rough lady.

1335
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Yeah.

1336
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,760
And he was very ashamed of her.

1337
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,760
And that's why he wants to go back to the hotel.

1338
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,760
And he said, would you like to come with me in the limo?

1339
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
And I said, well, actually have to go home.

1340
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,760
I haven't seen you for a long time.

1341
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,760
So that might be nice.

1342
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,760
So I went for a drink.

1343
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,760
Oh, and you didn't think of that moment?

1344
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,760
No, no, no, no.

1345
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
No, no, no.

1346
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
I didn't know.

1347
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
I mean, he had to slay thee with him.

1348
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,760
Oh, no.

1349
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
I'm a decent girl.

1350
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,760
Of course not.

1351
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,760
So we went upstairs and had a lovely talk about it.

1352
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
It is room.

1353
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Yeah.

1354
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,760
It was one of, it was in the big,

1355
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,760
The biggest sweets in the Amstahl hotel.

1356
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
And we had a drink.

1357
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,760
And we were talking about the early days.

1358
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,760
Because what happened in the meanwhile?

1359
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,760
Yeah.

1360
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
And I was telling him that fucking song can't believe it.

1361
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,760
Oh, yeah.

1362
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,760
I told him that.

1363
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,760
I said, can't believe it.

1364
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
Really?

1365
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
You were right.

1366
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,760
It was it.

1367
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
And.

1368
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,760
Oh.

1369
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,760
And did he say, yeah, told you so?

1370
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,760
And he was really sweet.

1371
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,760
And he was smoking.

1372
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Really his head off.

1373
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,760
You know, cigarettes.

1374
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
A joint.

1375
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,760
Of course.

1376
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,760
He was an Amsterdam.

1377
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
Yeah.

1378
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,760
And you just get a high just for being in the room.

1379
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
A little bit with him.

1380
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Oh, no, no, no.

1381
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,760
I smoked.

1382
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
And he, of course, he loved that.

1383
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,760
So it was just, it was very romantic.

1384
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,760
And he started to touch my hair.

1385
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
My, my shoulders.

1386
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,760
My, you know, my whole body.

1387
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
And I thought, boy.

1388
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,760
Okay.

1389
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
His fame is now.

1390
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
Yeah.

1391
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
And that was nice.

1392
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
I know he's much nice.

1393
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,760
I thought he is David Bowie.

1394
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Of course, you know.

1395
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,760
And I said, if I tell my sister,

1396
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,760
I walked away.

1397
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
And I didn't do that.

1398
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
I said, are you crazy?

1399
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
Yeah.

1400
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
I can't.

1401
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
So I went along.

1402
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
And he's a great lover.

1403
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,760
I have to say.

1404
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,760
Anna.

1405
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,760
Really?

1406
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,760
Yeah.

1407
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
Don't want to hear that.

1408
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
But he's a great lover.

1409
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,760
He has a lot of, so full of the girls.

1410
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,760
That.

1411
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,760
And done.

1412
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
And done.

1413
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
Done.

1414
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,760
This.

1415
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Are you listening?

1416
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,760
He is a great lover.

1417
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,760
He's unbelievable.

1418
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Patience.

1419
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,760
And he wants to give you everything you want.

1420
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,760
He'll think that's not a good one of those when he did.

1421
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,760
He led you from your head and that's him to your head.

1422
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,760
Tell me if you're head.

1423
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,760
He's not afraid.

1424
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Not at all.

1425
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,760
His penis size is medium.

1426
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
Not numbered that day.

1427
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,760
Not yet Nad, thank you for answering that question.

1428
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,760
So my secret day thereEnse means.

1429
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,760
Oh, that's what he's going.

1430
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
That's all he hopes to do.

1431
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
So I, they, he's calling him.

1432
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,760
Right.

1433
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,760
He's calling.

1434
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
That's right.

1435
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,760
Hi, David.

1436
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,760
I'm sorry.

1437
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,760
We're going to play his routine Dolph Fries Judge.

1438
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
I have to say nothing.

1439
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
Something else matters.

1440
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:24,760
That's inspirational. Very nice, nicely shaped, but nothing is he circumstance? No. No. I remember that.

1441
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,760
Yeah. No, no, no. Just a normal English Dick. Dicky.

1442
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,760
But it was nice. He went, oh, and he went on and went for a second time.

1443
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,760
There he is calling again. He was going to say it was actually three times.

1444
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:54,760
Really? Yeah, I remember that. And after that, I brush my teeth with his toothbrush, because I always liked brush my teeth afterwards.

1445
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,760
And then, you know, when I know that you hate to hear this, I know that.

1446
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,760
No, because knowing that my penis is bigger makes a world a difference.

1447
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Oh, okay. No. This is okay. This is valid.

1448
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,760
We didn't know each other then. Yeah. Yeah. I want to do what I'm going to do.

1449
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,760
And after, you know, when I was in the bathroom, I heard Angie coming in, and she was screaming at him.

1450
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Did you run the bathroom brush? I was in the bathroom and I thought she's going to get out of here.

1451
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,760
This woman is going to kill me. And I heard him.

1452
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,760
Yeah, I hear him shouting to her, and you're just such a pig, and you cannot behave.

1453
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,760
And this and that, and I can do whatever I want to. And you know, you do that too, and blah, blah, blah.

1454
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,760
So they had a big fight, and I slipped out.

1455
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,760
It's not that bad.

1456
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
It's not bad.

1457
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
He never saw him again.

1458
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,760
Yeah. And oh, yeah. We saw him.

1459
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,760
We saw him on a mantra.

1460
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,760
Yeah.

1461
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,760
Yeah.

1462
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,760
But that was with Angie.

1463
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,760
No, no, no, no. He was with Kiki, go, go, go, go.

1464
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
He was really weird. He was weird about that.

1465
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
He was doing, he was strange about it.

1466
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,760
Because he, this wife, his wife, then.

1467
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,760
Yeah.

1468
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,760
Whatever her name was.

1469
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,760
Yeah.

1470
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,760
Before.

1471
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,760
What is her, his wife now?

1472
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,760
Eman.

1473
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,760
Eman.

1474
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,760
Before Eman, he had a very jealous, jealous wife.

1475
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,760
I remember that.

1476
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,760
And I read that a couple of times in the magazines.

1477
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,760
So he didn't want to recognize, but he was waving at me.

1478
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,760
And then we saw him sort of party from Joan Jett, remember?

1479
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
Yeah.

1480
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
He was there too.

1481
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,760
Yeah.

1482
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,760
And he was waving his smile again.

1483
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,760
But he was still.

1484
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
Yeah.

1485
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,760
But he was so jealous.

1486
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,760
He's not a very social person.

1487
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
Yeah.

1488
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,760
Well, he was fucking diapers on the beach.

1489
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,760
What do you expect?

1490
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Yeah.

1491
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Fundus is wonderful.

1492
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,760
So that was my story with David Bowie.

1493
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,760
I really appreciate that.

1494
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,760
And he, and oh, and I'm in his book.

1495
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,760
Because he has a little tiny book.

1496
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
He had a little black book.

1497
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Yeah.

1498
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,760
So there's a little pocket book.

1499
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,760
When he's booty call.

1500
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Yeah.

1501
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,760
Sort of what he tells about his life.

1502
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,760
His life.

1503
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
All the chicks he had.

1504
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,760
Yeah.

1505
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,760
And there's pictures in it.

1506
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
Really.

1507
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
Yeah.

1508
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,760
And there's one picture where I'm really, I'm in the picture.

1509
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,760
But we've been taking, you know, have a proof it.

1510
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,760
I've been taking it.

1511
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,760
You've been taking it.

1512
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,760
There's actually two questions.

1513
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
Yeah.

1514
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,760
You think David Bowie's a vampire?

1515
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,760
Dawn wanted to know.

1516
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,760
Dawn used to dream that David Bowie was a vampire.

1517
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,760
And would come at night and bite her and they'd be vampires.

1518
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
Yeah.

1519
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,760
She wish.

1520
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,760
Yeah.

1521
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,760
Now he's a sweet guy.

1522
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,760
He's a sweet guy that he's a little bit insecure in a couple of things.

1523
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,760
Yeah.

1524
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
He's not very.

1525
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,760
He doesn't talk to you.

1526
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
He doesn't talk to you.

1527
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
Yeah.

1528
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
Isn't that strange?

1529
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,760
At the same time.

1530
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,760
Almost the same time.

1531
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
Yeah.

1532
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,760
But I don't have a bypass.

1533
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,760
They have same.

1534
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,760
They couldn't help me.

1535
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
But that's strange.

1536
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,760
Yeah.

1537
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,760
I don't know.

1538
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
You think he can still get it up with his bypass?

1539
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,760
Well, it depends on.

1540
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,760
I have to say, now you're not kidding because we know that from my dad.

1541
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,760
So Dawn, you know.

1542
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,760
So you don't have to worry about that.

1543
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
Yeah.

1544
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
He may appeal to you.

1545
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
Because of the medicine.

1546
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,760
If he has to take a lot of medicine, that could be a problem.

1547
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,760
Yeah.

1548
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,760
But still.

1549
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,760
He's very good.

1550
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,760
He's quite a talent.

1551
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
Oh, he's very talented.

1552
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
He's very talented.

1553
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,760
He's talented.

1554
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,760
He's talented.

1555
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
I have to say.

1556
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,760
I have to say he's a very nice, sweet person.

1557
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,760
Normally, I would play space.

1558
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,760
I'd already hear.

1559
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,760
But, you know, that's legal.

1560
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,760
Oh.

1561
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,760
Yeah.

1562
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,760
I would not love to do that.

1563
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,760
That sucks.

1564
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,760
Why?

1565
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
Because, you know, I can get sued for playing.

1566
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
For playing music that when I'd love to play.

1567
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,760
We have to play stuff that can't play our memories.

1568
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
That's illegal.

1569
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,760
That's actually the man.

1570
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Yeah.

1571
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,760
It's the law.

1572
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Oh.

1573
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,760
Doesn't that suck?

1574
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,760
Yeah.

1575
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,760
Yeah.

1576
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,760
Okay.

1577
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,760
Let's play space out of it.

1578
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
Thanks.

1579
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
That was a great story.

1580
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,760
Love you.

1581
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,760
Love you too.

1582
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,760
Thank you.

1583
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,760
Ground control to major time.

1584
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Ground control to major time.

1585
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on.

1586
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,760
You can't go to the train to major time.

1587
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,760
Six, come and think.

1588
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Count down engines on.

1589
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,760
Three, two, check, kick, watch them.

1590
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,760
And they guys love you with you.

1591
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:52,760
Yeah.

1592
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,760
This is ground control to major time.

1593
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,760
You've really made the grade.

1594
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,760
And the papers want to know who shuts you in.

1595
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,760
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare.

1596
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,760
This is major time to ground control.

1597
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,760
I'm stepping through the door.

1598
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,760
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way.

1599
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,760
And the stars look very different today.

1600
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,760
Here and I floating around I didn't care.

1601
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,760
Far above the world.

1602
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:53,760
I'm into this blue and there's nothing I can do.

1603
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:20,760
Don't want past one hundred thousand miles.

1604
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,760
I'm feeling very still.

1605
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,760
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.

1606
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:36,760
Tell my wife my love the very much you know.

1607
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,760
Ground control to major time your subject,

1608
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
That's something wrong.

1609
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,760
Can you hear me by your tongue?

1610
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,760
Can you hear me by my tongue?

1611
00:59:47,760 --> 01:00:01,760
Can you hear me by my sitting Конечноer of the mood?

1612
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:25,760
And there's nothing I can do.

1613
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,760
David Bowie was space oddity from the end of the sixties.

1614
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,260
I ran a lot longer than intended on today's show.

1615
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:38,760
We're an exactly an hour, but of course, when you get the sit down with Patricia for about 30 minutes

1616
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,260
and talk about David Bowie and the size of his penis.

1617
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,760
Hey, damn man, you just can't get that on regular radio.

1618
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,260
You know what I'm saying, Bowie!

1619
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,260
And that'll do it for the source code for today.

1620
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,260
Tuesday, October 26, 2004.

1621
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,260
Thank you very much for tuning in.

1622
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,760
Hopefully you stay all the way to the end, because I think that was well worth it.

1623
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,760
And this is one for the archives, eh?

1624
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,760
So that's it.

1625
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,760
I'm off to the Netherlands for some meetings, and of course, I'll be back tomorrow.

1626
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Our awesome intro.

1627
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,760
Comments via text or even audio comments.

1628
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,760
You can send them to Atomacree.com.

1629
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,760
What is your comment on my weblog live.curry.com?

1630
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,760
And all the archives and the most recently updated source code are at dailystorescode.com.

1631
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,760
You'll find the podcast feed as well.

1632
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,760
Did a source code.com slash all the says.fx and all.

1633
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,760
Who knows what the rest of the week will bring, but this was certainly an interesting ramp.

1634
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,760
I'd like to check you all tomorrow. Bye-bye.
