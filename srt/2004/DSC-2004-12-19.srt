00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,120
Adam Curry, rocking in Surrey, mashing up the T-world, radio-plash-say, mind the movie

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
we can tell us...

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
Yeah, how you doing?

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Welcome to the Daily Source Code as promised the Expedition on this Sunday, December 19th, 2004 coming

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
to you from Surrey, from the college.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
That bears the name of Curry.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Just what uses a developer's party together?

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Unbelievable.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,120
I was just about to hit the record button when the phone rang and it was Dave.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,120
He's on his way.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,120
What's going to work his way down south and then he's then I'll be cooking up with him

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,120
beginning of the year on the East Coast and he says, hey, he's a drive and everybody.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Okay, so I apologize profusely about Friday's source code.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,120
It just did not work out as I posted on my weblog.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Patricia had some emergency bridge work that had to get down and you know, you need your own mechanic for that.

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,120
I have to say for a country where people are not known for their wonderful teeth, which is certainly the United Kingdom.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,120
They have some excellent dentists. We did go to well, there's a whole row of dentists here in Guilford.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,120
They're all thanks to each other and she went there for some like emergency like cement.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,120
There's do something, you know, give me some gas and tape and some some string, some bailwire.

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,120
And they were, those people were, yeah, they knew what they were talking about, but still obviously Patricia has her, her own guy and Amsterdam.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,120
So, quick day trip back and forth to the lowlands and of course,

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,120
we had Patricia's parents, my in-laws coming, they're here, they came on Saturday.

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:17,120
So there was a lot of shopping to get done and Christina and I went out and got really wrong Christmas lights, you know, the pink kind.

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,120
We rushed back because we had to go across the street to the neighbors for a lovely, pre-Christmas supper.

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,120
It was so nice that they invited us and a couple of their friends, also neighbors from around the way.

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,120
And so Christina and I had a really rush and get all the shopping done, everything for the weekend.

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
And we also got a really, really, really gotty Christmas tree.

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,120
You know, about 75, 80 centimeters high, but with the fiber optics in it in the branches.

29
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,120
So I first you take it out of the box, you unfold it all the, I can take a picture of this thing.

30
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,120
And then it has, what's the halogen light underneath in the base?

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
And that just rotates and changes color.

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,120
So it got like yellow and green and red and purple and pink and I had that in front of the window.

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:14,120
So while we were having dinner at the neighbors, Patricia was on our way back from Amsterdam and got back from the airport and saw that.

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
I was like, ah, ah, yeah, I live here, right?

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
And her parents arrived all in one piece, so that's nice.

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,120
And so it's just been really, really busy.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Excuse me.

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Still running around getting all these, all the, you know, the last bits done of just, just basically moving in.

39
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
And of course, I still have no broadband to speak of.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Well, I've been doing pretty good with, um, with the podcast.

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
I've been keeping up okay.

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I've found the number of way to, uh, to, to Jerry rig the, the iPod or clients that I'm doing some, uh, some other scripts and stuff.

43
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm really getting back in the watch out ladies and gentlemen.

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm really getting into programming again.

45
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Now there's this open source version of Frontier.

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Now that I had anything to do with it, but, um, well, actually a couple of things.

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,120
I migrated everything over curry dot com and live dot curry dot com and www dot curry dot com.

48
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,120
And, um, and not daily source code dot com yet.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
That's still in its original place.

50
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
But everything is now moved to a new server.

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,120
It's all, you know, all URLs are pointing to the same place.

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Um, the RSS feeds are still in the same location, even though you can update to the new one if you, if you want.

53
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
It won't make any difference.

54
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
So all of that stuff, um, freed me up from using radio user land.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Which, you know, I had so much running so many different sites and so many different applications and tools and renders and god knows what over the years that I'd had that put into my,

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,120
into my tools folder or my www folder.

57
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,120
There was becoming a real resource hog, um, but I needed it, you know, first of all is the outline.

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,120
I love writing it in an outliner, um, but just running the thing was a little bit too heavy on the resources.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
So now I have this, uh, OPML is what it's called, uh, make sense.

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
So we'll just call it the OPML, uh, app.

61
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Um, and I'm using that.

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,120
I've been using outliners for, for preparing my podcasts, uh, since day one, of course.

63
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
And using them for the, uh, for the show notes.

64
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
And now it kind of just sits there.

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
It's, it's literally doing nothing.

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
It's just kind of cruising along.

67
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
And today, um, you might have read on my, uh, it's Sunday.

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
By the way, did I mention that?

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
It's the 19th.

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Uh, I had a really weird dream that I was, I was actually walking along an OPML outline in the

71
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
iPod or directory.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,120
And I was jumping off to all these different notes.

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
I was jumping off to different countries.

74
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
And it was, it was twisted.

75
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
And then when I, when I woke up this morning, I said, yeah, that's it.

76
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
I got to write a crawler that, that, you know, walks along the, uh, the OPML path.

77
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,120
And I actually, um, I spent about five or six hours.

78
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
And, uh, I've got it to kind of crawl along.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
And it doesn't jump off to the external links yet, but it will.

80
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Um, and essentially what I want to do is make something that makes my job easier.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Um, it'll crawl through the entire, so if you, if you can hold off on updating any notes,

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,120
um, for another day or two, that'd be great.

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
But it basically, it'll crawl off, find anything that's new.

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
It'll maintain its own database of, uh, feeds.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,120
But it'll also crawl into, uh, other databases.

86
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Uh, and we're just, basically, everybody's doing, right?

87
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,120
It's kind of populating, uh, uh, their own stuff.

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Um, and it will, uh, uh, it will update the, what's new,

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
node with anything that's new.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,120
And it'll also automatically post, um, new podcasts to the ipadr.org homepage.

91
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,120
And I might have, uh, I have to put some kind of step in between there,

92
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
because I'm sure that somewhere we're going to get spam or something, we don't happen.

93
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Or something, we'll probably just break more than likely the code that I'm creating.

94
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,120
So, um, uh, anyway, that was, that was what I was kind of doing this weekend.

95
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, yeah, hold on a second.

96
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,120
So many, so many requests for more cowbell, not that I can give you more cowbell,

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
but damn, I can sure give you some drum cadence, everybody.

98
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Tyler Clark sent this one in.

99
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:16,120
It's the golden regimen marching man from Blue Springs, Missouri.

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Suburb of Kansas City.

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
I love this.

102
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,120
More cadence.

103
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:16,120
So, part of what I've been, uh, thinking of here is, uh, once I figure out how to really work

104
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,120
with these OPML files, this is exactly the kind of stuff that I want you to be able to

105
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,120
click to and just pull in the, you know, this whole file is whole drum cadence.

106
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
So, you have to go hunting around for it.

107
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
I got to automate this stuff.

108
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Got to make it easy.

109
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Of course, when I get my four megabits of broadband, that will be a happier day.

110
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
When we talk about that later on in the show.

111
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
Also got a long distance dedication on that daily source code.

112
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
We'll just finish up one more minute of March to the stadium.

113
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,120
That is a curry.

114
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Hello daily source code.

115
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
I've been a podcast listener.

116
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
The daily source code for two weeks.

117
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,120
And I have been a Mac user for about two weeks.

118
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I've been a Mac user for about two weeks.

119
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
I've been a Mac user for about two weeks.

120
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
I've been a Mac user for about two weeks.

121
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
And I've been a Mac user for about two years.

122
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
And I really enjoy the program.

123
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,120
I enjoyed the temptations track.

124
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
I was a really jamming tune while I was driving to work in my Honda element.

125
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I learned out of the six speakers with a subwoofer kicked in.

126
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I hope you get your DSL stuff worked out.

127
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
And I was in England.

128
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
I lived in England 20 years ago.

129
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,120
And I thought British telecom was asked backwards back then.

130
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Not surprised that they still are asked backwards.

131
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Hang in there.

132
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Cool program.

133
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Love it.

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Thanks buddy.

135
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Boeing.

136
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Was that it?

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
I guess it was.

138
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,120
A little bit of music stinger there on the outro.

139
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Yeah.

140
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah.

141
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Check that.

142
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
It's a daily source code.

143
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Adam Curry on your MP3 player.

144
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
And if you have an audio comment send it off to me.

145
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Adam at curry.com.

146
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
If you can keep it under three to five.

147
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Yeah, about under five megs.

148
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
It'll be cool.

149
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I'll just cash it to keep the email client.

150
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Actually, I'm going to set up a separate email account for that.

151
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,120
And I've also been setting up new servers, new bandwidth stuff.

152
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Getting everything ready for my trip tomorrow.

153
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm going to the Netherlands.

154
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I'll be staying in Utrecht.

155
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
My mom is going in for operation tomorrow.

156
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
So it's a big big day.

157
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
And I'll be staying in Holland for a couple of days.

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Pretty much in the hotel or in the hospital.

159
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,120
So if I'm not in the hospital and they've really shitting visiting hours, which I've got

160
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
to work on that.

161
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
It's like five to eight.

162
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,120
What the hell is that?

163
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
They should have some late morning visiting hour or something.

164
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,120
So I'll work on that.

165
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,120
So I'll keep you up the speed and what's going on.

166
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
And there will be a podcast for Monday.

167
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Although it may be late.

168
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
It may not be until late Monday.

169
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
But then hopefully I'll have some news for you as well.

170
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
I'll be tomorrow.

171
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I said, this is a special source code because I screwed it up and just couldn't get it together

172
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
on Friday.

173
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
And it really hurt.

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
I got to tell you.

175
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
I had so much to say.

176
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
And I was like, I really didn't want to do a show.

177
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
But just couldn't.

178
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Just could not.

179
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,120
And I still had stuff to download, which is still the hardest part.

180
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,120
I have to have so much preparation done without this fricking bandwidth.

181
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Because I just can't sit here and wait 30 minutes to download one song.

182
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,120
I have to think days ahead sometimes.

183
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Great news.

184
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,120
The latest podcasts to join the scene.

185
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,120
If you check out ipodder.org regularly, if you subscribe to the XML feed, the RSS feed.

186
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
NASA.

187
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
That's right.

188
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Space boys.

189
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Now podcasting.

190
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
They're later stories.

191
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
A lot of people jumped all over this.

192
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Helped them out a little bit.

193
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Setting up their feed a bit better.

194
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
We're basically naming their MP3s.

195
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
All story dot MP3.

196
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
We've been around that way.

197
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
We've already figured out what naming conventions have to be and what you need.

198
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Let me see if they actually have any ideas.

199
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
I don't even think they have ID3 tags.

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Let me see.

201
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Probably not.

202
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm just checking right now.

203
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
No.

204
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Not at all zero.

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Okay.

206
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Well, hopefully they know how to fly those fucking things into space.

207
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Why do workouts work?

208
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,120
This, by the way, is a NASA podcast.

209
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,120
By science at NASA.

210
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,120
By exploring how and why exercise causes muscles to grow.

211
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Scientists hope to help astronauts avoid muscle atrophy.

212
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,120
December 10, 2004.

213
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Most machines don't improve with use.

214
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Old pickup trucks don't gradually become furars.

215
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Just by driving them fast.

216
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
And the pocket calculator.

217
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,120
I hope you write to themselves too because this is wonderful.

218
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,120
This is, this is has to be the best couple minutes these days on my iPod.

219
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
This is just wonderful.

220
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I won't change into a super computer by crunching lots of numbers.

221
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
The human body is different.

222
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,120
As weight lifters know, the more that people use their muscles,

223
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
the stronger they become.

224
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
And unused muscles do not remain preserved.

225
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Neglect causes them to waste away.

226
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
All right.

227
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Any production show notes for today's source code.

228
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I have a link to the, to the feed.

229
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,120
So you can subscribe to that in your iPod or I really suggest you.

230
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
You do because it's just one of the stuff.

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Just if you take it in or out of context, I guess.

232
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
It's really hilarious.

233
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Now the entire story.

234
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
That's about five, six minutes.

235
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
It's well worth it.

236
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Very, very funny stuff.

237
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Hey, Adam.

238
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
This is Richard Smith from yesterday.

239
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Radio vaulted.

240
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
New podcast.

241
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,120
From the cross was constant.

242
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I was wondering if there's a way with iPod or if you can only.

243
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Say you want the latest podcast from like say to daily source code.

244
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Instead of downloading all of the daily source codes,

245
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,120
I just transferred over from a different podcast reader.

246
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
And I'm using iPod or now I'm kind of liking iPod or

247
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
it doesn't really allow me number one.

248
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,120
It doesn't allow me to function as.

249
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,120
It doesn't allow me just to download one program.

250
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Right.

251
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,120
It will allow me to download all of the programs instead of just one.

252
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Right.

253
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
I don't know if there's a setting on iPod.

254
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm sure you're talking about the iPod or lemon.

255
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
But I know what I know where he's coming from now.

256
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
I think.

257
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Is that he wants to take his subscriptions with him.

258
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,120
As well as his history.

259
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
And subscriptions, of course,

260
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
an OPML file is perfect as a reading list,

261
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
as a listening list, as your own personal station.

262
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
You know, although I try not to make the Tvo comparison.

263
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,120
When it comes to this stuff, there's really nothing wrong with it.

264
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,120
If you have a Tvo, you know that you're basically subscribing to shows.

265
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
And not, you don't subscribe to CBS.

266
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,120
You know, you subscribe to the late show with David Letterman.

267
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
So when you have all those different programs,

268
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
what you want is you want to be able to just imagine me to take those with you.

269
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Right.

270
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,120
And then pop it into a Tvo at your vacation address or something like that.

271
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Forget it.

272
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Let's just keep it in the iPod around this easier.

273
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
So you can do that with OPML.

274
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,120
You can do that with a lot of regular text news aggregators.

275
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,120
And I believe that most of the iPoders now support

276
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
import, if not, also export of OPML.

277
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Interesting, though, what Richard, I think, what I think he's saying is he also wants to take his history with him,

278
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,120
which I guess could also be contained in OPML file.

279
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
But I'm not too sure about that.

280
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Let's just listen in a little bit more.

281
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Also, it needs a space saver program.

282
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,120
So that will delete the last program played.

283
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Oh, man.

284
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Boy, is he actually Richard is totally asking for Tvo functionality.

285
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Totally content management.

286
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Another big one that the iPoder developers have to look at.

287
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
So if you're downloading the addition of the 15th,

288
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
it'll delete the 14th of the source code instead.

289
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,120
If you've heard that way, you can save space that way.

290
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
It's just some thoughts and ideas.

291
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,120
And I'm hoping that the iPoder developers will come up with in the future

292
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,120
and besides the OPLM stuff.

293
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:26,120
So will the OPLM's ideas also work for like the Dell DJ and some of the windows,

294
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
so it says as well.

295
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
MP3 players as well.

296
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Really?

297
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
They work with women with MP3 players.

298
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
And he meant OPML.

299
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
He said, oh, MPL, but that's okay.

300
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
We're working with something.

301
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
So it says as well.

302
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
What's your question?

303
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,120
And some of the windows says as well.

304
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
MP3 players as well.

305
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Just as few thoughts to keep the windows side of the listeners happy.

306
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I wonder if if there's any MP3 player out there that actually can do anything with MP with OPML.

307
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,120
And there is good news about the iRiver iFP799.

308
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,120
There is indeed a way to change or upgrade the firmware so you don't have to go through all the DRM stuff.

309
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,120
I'll talk about that on tomorrow's source code because I've had all lined up.

310
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
I've got audio comments.

311
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
I've got links.

312
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
I've got emails.

313
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Anything you want about hacking that up.

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,120
And I was able to put the file on there.

315
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,120
An OPML file onto the iRiver player.

316
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Guess what?

317
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
It didn't do anything.

318
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
But you can see the file system.

319
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
You can browse it.

320
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
So I'm thinking that maybe, you know,

321
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I'll have to look into the firmware or whatever that works.

322
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Apparently someone knows what's going on with the firmware.

323
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Maybe we can make something into the firmware that will read OPML would not be cool.

324
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I would certainly put any MP3 manufacturer who was interested in doing that.

325
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
You know, would give them an instant audience.

326
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
You know, if think about being able to browse through show notes,

327
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,120
think about being able to browse through directory and setting,

328
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,120
you know, setting, what could you set?

329
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I don't know.

330
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,120
You know, I'm sure you could, well, basically,

331
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Tevo on the go.

332
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Okay, quick broadband update.

333
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,120
As you know, I'll be in possession of some Wi-Fi for the next couple days.

334
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
So don't feel too bad for me.

335
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,120
I think I told you on Thursday that was it on Thursday?

336
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Maybe it wasn't.

337
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Yeah, I did.

338
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
I wrote on my weblog.

339
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
That's what it was.

340
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
NTL who I had this backup plan.

341
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
So I've got the easy net guys.

342
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
I've got the router to big business broadband set of four megabit down,

343
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
725k up.

344
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,120
They can't install until January 4th, which double sucks,

345
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
A because I won't have until January 4th.

346
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
B because I won't be here.

347
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,120
And it's, well, that means that it may not work by the time I get back.

348
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I had a backup because two weeks ago I had ordered a cable modem

349
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,120
through NTL, which is pretty much the only cable company in the neighborhood

350
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
and they could hook us up.

351
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,120
And they gave me an install date of December 20th.

352
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
I wouldn't have been here either for, well,

353
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,120
I might have depending if they were coming in the morning after noon.

354
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Of course, they always come at the end of the day.

355
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
They've been here either, but at least it would have been here.

356
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
And they called up earlier the week and said,

357
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Oh, well, you know, we're sorry.

358
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
We can't make it.

359
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
It'll be the fourth of January.

360
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
I said, well, that's no good.

361
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
And you said the 20th, yeah, but we're not going to be able to make it.

362
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
But the whole point of that was that you could make it before the 20th.

363
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
You said the date.

364
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
You agreed to it with me.

365
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Well, we're sorry.

366
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
So am I a cancel the order?

367
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Uh-huh.

368
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Got an email.

369
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Was this a comment?

370
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Yeah, that was a comment.

371
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
About the anti-L anchors.

372
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Adam, you better believe it about NTL.

373
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,120
They're company with the most unbelievably arrogant call-out engineers.

374
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,120
And there's a fault that needs fixing and phone tech support.

375
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
You have to explain the concept of networking, too.

376
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,120
My personal favorite is the time I run up with a problem on a PC with two Nick Cards.

377
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Want to a broadband mode on one for the land.

378
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,120
And the tech support guy told me I couldn't do that because the computer wouldn't know which of these

379
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Cards was for which connection.

380
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Sure, that wasn't an outsourced support.

381
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Um, so obviously I've still been hitting Starbucks.

382
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Oh, yeah, I had this question about why how Starbucks came up with their, uh, with their drink sizes.

383
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,120
You know, what's up with the tall, the Grande and the, uh, and the venti.

384
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,120
And comment on the weblog from James Fairbane.

385
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Starbucks drink sizes.

386
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
They did use to have a short size.

387
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,120
They've got rid of it and added venti at the top end.

388
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Venti is Italian for 20.

389
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,120
And refers to the 20 fluid ounces that's the volume of the drink.

390
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
And it is fricking huge.

391
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
I mean, it's like a fishbowl.

392
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,120
So next time you order a venti latte, take a moment to realize that you're asking for a British

393
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
pint of coffee.

394
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Oh, and what's the scariest statistics?

395
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,120
One of their bigger drinks has as many calories as 37 spoons of sugar.

396
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

397
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I always feel good.

398
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Patricia actually came into on, uh, I guess that was maybe that was Thursday.

399
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
I was at Starbucks.

400
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,120
I was, you know, there in the corner and the little in the smelly chairs.

401
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Put a close to the power outlet.

402
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
And also they had this, hello.

403
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I don't know.

404
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Because she never seen me there.

405
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
She never been to the Starbucks.

406
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,120
And she actually, all of a sudden, she felt like really bad.

407
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Really, really bad for me.

408
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,120
And I got a top 10, the broadband top 10 from Jeff, shoot, you know, I should have,

409
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I don't have a, like a David Letterman top 10.

410
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Why don't I, I know what I can do.

411
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
Oh, a second.

412
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,120
I says what my production system will be just perfect for here.

413
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
We'll use some drum cadence here.

414
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Well, I do the top 10 reasons.

415
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Adam, can't get broadband access.

416
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,120
It is new place, curry cottage in the UK.

417
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Number 10, the term broad ban.

418
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,120
A tad bit sexist, don't you think?

419
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Number 9.

420
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Asking for the big pipe means something altogether different and Britain.

421
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Number 8, Starbucks is paying Adam to keep coming there for expensive lattes

422
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
and fast net access.

423
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Number 7, overheard at NTL.

424
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Adam Curry?

425
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Who the bloody hell is Adam Curry?

426
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Number 6, overheard at NTL.

427
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,120
If we give him two megabits per second, he'll want four megabits per second.

428
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Where does it all end?

429
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Number 5, overheard at NTL.

430
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
That internet thing.

431
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
He spows it to everyone to catch on.

432
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Number 4, overheard at NTL.

433
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,120
It just wants it for the pawn.

434
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Number 3, overheard at NTL.

435
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
He's got dial up.

436
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
What's the rush?

437
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Number 2, overheard at NTL.

438
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,120
This guy called to order service, but all he kept saying was,

439
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
point, point, point.

440
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,120
And the number one reason that I'm can't get broadbed access at the cottage.

441
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,120
When he called NTL, he told him he was the Prince of Pod,

442
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,120
but the sales agent thought she heard me say Prince of Darkness.

443
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I don't know.

444
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,120
I don't have like a pole that bounce off of when I bomb terribly on the top 10 list.

445
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
No, do I.

446
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Oh, I've always got dug.

447
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Hello, this is Doug K with IT conversations.

448
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,120
We didn't have a chance to put together a Gilmore gang show this week.

449
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,120
It's holiday season and the gang is scattered throughout the world.

450
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,120
So I hope what you'll do is take this opportunity to listen to some of the shows in the archives.

451
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
There's the phone ring.

452
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
That must be still Gilmore.

453
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
How coincident?

454
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Hello Steve.

455
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Hey Doug.

456
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
So, uh...

457
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,120
I think we're going to just rerack up, uh...

458
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
What?

459
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Did it rerack it up?

460
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
The last show.

461
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,120
The one on identity digital identity.

462
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
We're still Winley.

463
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
We're still Winley.

464
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
We're still Winley.

465
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
And Dr. O's and Johnny Tell.

466
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Yeah, I listened to that show.

467
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I did.

468
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
I listened to the show.

469
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
And, uh...

470
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,120
You know, I haven't heard anything about it from anybody.

471
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,120
So, please probably a lot of people out there who haven't listened to you.

472
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Yeah.

473
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
I listened to it.

474
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I heard it.

475
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Gilmore gang.

476
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Check them out.

477
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
IT Conversations.com.

478
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
And, um...

479
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Sounds like the, uh...

480
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
The source code and other podcasts.

481
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,120
I'm going to do a real good job with the lascivious bitties.

482
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Um...

483
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Now getting notes.

484
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
And of course, all the stuff is all in the, uh...

485
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
In the production show notes.

486
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,120
That the bitties are sold out on Amazon.

487
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
That's awesome.

488
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I mean, actually it's not awesome, but it's cool.

489
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
So, um...

490
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
But you can always go to bittiesforever.com

491
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
And, uh...

492
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Leon has emailed me that they're doing everything they can to make sure there's a...

493
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Supply, a plenty for all you bitties fans.

494
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,120
And actually, they're about four bitties fans who did show up

495
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
that their show, um...

496
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Last Tuesday in New York.

497
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Um...

498
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Which is cool.

499
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
And they really appreciate it.

500
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,120
And I think Leon's working on some kind of Christmas thing

501
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
or song.

502
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I'm not too sure of it.

503
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I don't know if she's going to be able to get it done at a time,

504
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
but I sure hope so.

505
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
And, um...

506
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
I love this drum cadence.

507
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
All right, stop.

508
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,120
I got it in the email from, uh... from Mark.

509
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Um...

510
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
And this is a Dutch email.

511
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
So you can read that in the show notes as well.

512
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
But, uh, well, it's Dutch.

513
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,120
So you may not really be anything for you.

514
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
But, um...

515
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
sent me, uh...

516
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
sent... I don't know where the hell he got this.

517
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,120
You know, back in the day, commercials.

518
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Actually, you know, how we now have jingles.

519
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Um, and you'll probably remember, um...

520
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
like, uh...

521
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Oh, depending on how old you are.

522
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,120
For me, one of the older, like, real long commercials,

523
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
which was maybe...

524
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
She would...

525
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Maybe they were, like...

526
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Well, hold on.

527
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
I probably have the coat commercials here.

528
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Um, you know, they sold out to...

529
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Was it... was it the new seekers?

530
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Wasn't that it?

531
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
I'd like to teach the world the sing.

532
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Uh, hold on.

533
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
I might have that.

534
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
In my iTunes.

535
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Um...

536
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Maybe under Coke.

537
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Uh, I'd like to buy the world of Coke.

538
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
That's what it was.

539
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Okay, hold on.

540
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Let me just play a little bit for you.

541
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Because literally, um...

542
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
These songs were...

543
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
What were they?

544
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Like a minute long.

545
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
So here's just a quick example, right?

546
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Remember this one?

547
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Yeah.

548
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
So that was the new seekers.

549
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
But...

550
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Essentially, even further back than this,

551
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
these used to be full songs.

552
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I mean, they would have a beginning and ending,

553
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
and they would last up to, you know, like,

554
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
three to five minutes.

555
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
So it was real tunes.

556
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
This is actually pretty darn good example.

557
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,120
I remember singing that as a kid.

558
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
I love that.

559
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
So, um...

560
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,120
What Mark found is he found one that Patricia did,

561
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
and it has... Patricia tried to peg it.

562
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,120
She said it was probably around 71 72.

563
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Um...

564
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
And it was for skull beer.

565
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
SKOL.

566
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
You probably... you probably heard of skull beer.

567
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Uh... she says,

568
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
real apologies for the pronunciation,

569
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
but that was what it was supposed to be.

570
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
So when you hear her pronounce the English words,

571
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,120
kind of in a... in a... like a Dutch German Danish almost kind of way...

572
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Apologies.

573
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,120
But here she is from the really old archives.

574
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
God knows where Mark found this.

575
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Uh... singing the skull song,

576
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,120
which I believe she actually wrote some of the herpics for as well.

577
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Yeah, we're gonna play here.

578
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Come along now.

579
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Yeah.

580
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,120
So the traditionalist,

581
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,120
it's called the traditionalist,

582
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
just a refreshing one.

583
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
It says,

584
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,120
you see for the reak you can be.

585
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,120
And by the way, this her sister Ivana is also singing in the chorus.

586
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Trans eggplant.

587
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
yeah,

588
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
It's called the traditionalist,

589
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
call the original script.

590
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Also,

591
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,120
she's sound tracks were used in the movie theatre as well,

592
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
but really long it will become her creation.

593
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,080
Tell me, do you want me to?

594
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,680
Do you want me to tell you?

595
00:30:42,680 --> 00:31:12,680

601
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
And all just to Adam Curry and all of his listeners.

602
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,080
And did we say where we're from?

603
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,880
Boeing.

604
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Boeing.

605
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,680
Wow.

606
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,080
Delta Park product.

607
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,280
Yeah.

608
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,800
It's a weekly show we do here on the internet.

609
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,880
And big, big, this is Jacobos.

610
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,600
Now Paul's going to sing a song.

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,600
Okay.

612
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,200
I didn't know it was going to be on the spot.

613
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,800
God rest.

614
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Gmail, read your little man, let nothing eat us may.

615
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,000
I remember the but wait.

616
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,800
No, Jesus wasn't born on Christmas day.

617
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
Listen to our podcast.

618
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,600
Delta Park project.com.

619
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Yeah.

620
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Right.

621
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Okay.

622
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
And now there's a gentleman.

623
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Right.

624
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
That's not the song.

625
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm going to put a one for you.

626
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,600
And now ladies and gentlemen.

627
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Time for a long distance dedication on the daily

628
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
source code.

629
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I need some more reverb for this.

630
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,400
You know I need reverb.

631
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Reverb.

632
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I still a bit more reverb.

633
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Much better.

634
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Oops.

635
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Damn.

636
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Dear Adam.

637
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Yesterday I had an epiphany.

638
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I was listening to you show on the Long Island Railroad to work yesterday morning.

639
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Often laughing and smiling at certain parts of the show.

640
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,400
When a beautiful girl sat down across me and took out her green iPod mini to listen to.

641
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I couldn't help noticing that she was laughing and smiling along to whatever she was listening

642
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
to as well.

643
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I first thought, well she was listening to a podcast.

644
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Could she have been listening to the same daily source code that I was listening to?

645
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Well Adam, being the huge voice that I am, I didn't say a word.

646
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Probably never see that girl again.

647
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,400
However, it got me thinking, what if iPods had Bluetooth built in?

648
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,400
And would broadcast your current song information to your neighbor?

649
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,400
It would be awesome to see what everyone else is listening to.

650
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
And it would be a great conversation starter.

651
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I think podcasting is taking what is so far been primarily anti-social activity

652
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,400
listening to iPods and made it more social and interactive.

653
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
I think adding the sort of Bluetooth communication is the logical next step.

654
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,400
The possibilities of iPod podcasts and Bluetooth seem endless.

655
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Okay, Dan from New York.

656
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Luckily he gets back to the chick, right?

657
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
This room.

658
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Oh, let's re-verb.

659
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Yes.

660
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,400
If the pretty girl with red hair and the green iPod mini was sat in front of me on Tuesday's listening,

661
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,400
please write in.

662
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Okay, Dan.

663
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
She hears this.

664
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I guarantee you score my friend.

665
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,400
You see this guy.

666
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,400
This guy is in love with you.

667
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Yes, I'm in love.

668
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Who looks at you the way I do?

669
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:13,400
When you smile, I get to know each other.

670
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Very well.

671
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Okay.

672
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I show you

673
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
from a plan

674
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I got to know your goals.

675
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,400
I've heard some talk.

676
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,400
They say you think I'm fine.

677
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Yes, I'm in love.

678
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,400
And what I do to make you mind

679
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Down in love

680
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,400
isn't so don't let me be

681
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Don't refuse to know my name

682
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm in love with you

683
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm in love with you

684
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Say you're in love with this guy

685
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,400
If not I'll just die.

686
00:36:50,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Down in love isn't so don't let me be

687
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Don't let me be

688
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Don't let me be

689
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Don't let me be

690
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Don't let me be

691
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Don't let me be

692
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Don't let me be

693
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Don't let me be

694
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Say you're in love with this guy

695
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,400
If not I'll just die

696
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
I don't just love that little D-R-M thing

697
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I put in the middle of that

698
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm sorry about that

699
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I don't know if something froze

700
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Anyway, I've rendered it totally useless for

701
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
You'll copy purposes

702
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Guys and love with you on your daily source code

703
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Winding up the show for today

704
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
And I forgot to tell you that

705
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Now the files are going to be in three places

706
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
as some testing and some more work

707
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Goes on behind the scenes

708
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Dave and I are certainly working on more

709
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
The production process

710
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
So Mark is a big part of this

711
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,400
So now we're hosting the main file

712
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Is on the dot mac account

713
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Which is the one that's listed in the RSS feed

714
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
For the daily source code

715
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Then there is the backup

716
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Which we're running on the OPML.org server

717
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
And check this out

718
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,400
As well we actually had it for a little while now

719
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
But as of today also listed in the production show notes

720
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,400
A direct bit torrent download link for the daily source code

721
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm not going to be putting that in the RSS file

722
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Just yet we've got lots of stuff to work on

723
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
We have this namespace to connect that up to it

724
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,400
But if you want to check it out

725
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
It has the same naming convention

726
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,400
As you're used to for the files

727
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,400
On the OPML.org server

728
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Check out the show notes for today's podcast

729
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
And you'll be able to link into that

730
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,400
It's just kind of the geeky part of the bit torrent stuff

731
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Until we get that all automated

732
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
And that's going to do it for me

733
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
For now tomorrow

734
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I am off to Holland

735
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
And I'll have some bandwidth baby

736
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
So as always

737
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Comments are welcome email

738
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
AudioComments, Adam & Curry.com

739
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
If you keep it under 5 megs

740
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Go ahead and just shoot it off and email

741
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
And attach it

742
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
No problem

743
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
We'll download overnight

744
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Everything now is a Curry.com

745
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
So that's the best place to leave comments

746
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,400

00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
With news on my mama

750
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,400
And everything else that happens

751
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Between here and tomorrow

752
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
