00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well hello, welcome to the socials code for Tuesday, September 20th.

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and Brussels is...

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And then I've got most of the audio stuff all worked out and I only have let's see

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Five external boxes have to carry around with me in addition to my laptop

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But I want to record something it's still pretty mobile. I had to take two trips because we're

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
stairs in what I'd call the deadest room in the world.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, dead. There's no echo.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I just wanted to try it and see if a different sound would put me in a different mood or

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
give you a different vibe when listening to the show.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And also it has an added advantage of being directly above the bar area where the wifi

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
setup is so I have 100% full signal because it's just beaming right up through the

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
floor.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So this is the source code we use as a developer's party together again Tuesday, September

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
21st.

15
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I have a speaking gig tomorrow and I still have to prepare and think about what I'm going

16
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
to talk about.

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Although you can bet it's going to be a lot about.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
And what we're doing is something that a lot of folks now are calling podcasting.

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I picked it up from Dave Slusher.

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,500
He picked it up from, well, he didn't know where he got it from other than that he had seen a couple of

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,500
refers in his refer log for podcasting.net.

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:32,500
And on the iPod developer list, an email showed up from Danny Gregory or Gregoir, I think it is.

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
He says, wow, I got back from Weekend Away to find podcasting mentioned in both Dave and Adam's show.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
I conjured up the term while writing a post to this list last week.

25
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Then after good night's sleep, it struck me.

26
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Check to see if any of the names were available.

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
They were, so he registered it.

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
And I'm glad he chose podcasting.net.

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Instead of his original thought, he had named it episode.

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,500
And then the I and the P and the I and the O and the D are all uppercase.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Right. Okay. I think podcasting.net.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is fantastic so props out to Danny for coming up with that.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Couple of things that I've run into as we're learning more and more about how to do these

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
shows and what setup is needed and...

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Doing that through iPod er. Oh, you know, I gotta blow my nose hold on a second

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now that I have this different setup

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm actually sitting on the edge of a bed and I have a very small stool where I have the laptop set up

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I'm leaning forward with the result that oh man, this is gonna be so disgusting. I don't think we yeah

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Who wants to hear this?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
shoot

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We need to have some nose blowing music then so you don't have to listen to me

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Snottering and snooting away

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me get back here

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Plugging the headphones again. Okay

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
One of the advantages of iTunes is it's always kind of right there. Let's see

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
About some dialing music, what do we have?

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Not dialing music. We want some nose blowing music

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anything under. Oh, I know we'll get

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ah, got a song for ya.

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Uhhhh...

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Okay, I'll play this song.

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Psst!

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
I'm gonna go blow my nose. I'll be right back.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She wanders through the world But something's wrong with her

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She wanders through the world But something's wrong with her

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
better. There we go. A little bit of Mo Jones there, how the wind blows. Okay, so

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've been getting a lot of comments about the size of the files. Now I've never

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
really paid much attention to the actual file sizes because

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the whole point is that you can have these massive files that are

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
going to be downloaded overnight, presumably, although it seems like people

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
are still using these news aggregators and checking every single hour for

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
new updated shows. But there is a lot to be said for the size and

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
we might as well, yeah, we're gonna have to deal with this stuff. We're gonna have to

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
deal with bandwidth and file storage. So we might as well do it as much as we

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
can right now. And let's see, I have some notes about this particular topic.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
See, yeah, so I always thought that I should just record, you know, stereo 16 bits and I

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
chose 96.

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,500
What is that 96 kilobits as my sample rate?

71
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And now I got berated by a couple people over email saying, you know, how come you don't

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
use VBR, which is variable bit rate?

73
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
And I really don't know what VBR does or what the best quality is.

74
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I just, I want to, you know, I want it to sound great.

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I want the, if I'm playing an MP3, I want it to sound like an MP3 on your iPod.

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I don't want it to sound like God forbid like some audio books I've purchased in recent

77
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
history.

78
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,500
So if, you know, if we want to get a conversation started about that, if anyone has any

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
pointers to what can best be used, you know, what is, what is going to be appropriate?

80
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Now, granted, if you're only using, if you're only doing voice, then you may be able to

81
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
get away with a much lower quality setting.

82
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
But still, you know, just think about the audience.

83
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
They're driving there in their car and they're checking out the zapping through the playlist

84
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
and all of a sudden it's like you're switching from FM to AM.

85
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
So, you know, and that's not always a pleasurable experience.

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Although you don't get used to almost

87
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,500
listening to it for a for a little while. Another thing is naming conventions. Now, I'm all over the map on this.

88
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,500
You know, there's really it's it's a bug in iPod. I don't know. I'm sure that other mp3 players do a much better job of this

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
But if you have a long

90
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
title

91
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
It doesn't scroll or in the in the playlist

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,500
It doesn't scroll past, you know, like the word September which I was spelling full out in the beginning and then it says dot dot dot

93
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,500
You know, you just you can't scroll to the whichever episodes you want because you

94
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Literally can't see it in the playlist on the iPod, which I do consider it to be a bug. So

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Even though I hate doing this I

96
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
shortened up the daily source code, which is how I titled all of my

97
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
All of my shows the file names were daily source code

98
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Dash and then a date structure dot mp3

99
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
and I shortened that to DSC and

100
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Now I've narrowed it down to where people are, you know going back and forth and giving me advice and pointing to different

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
standards and

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And I think that I'm gonna go with the European Convention,

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which makes the most sense to me since, you know,

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
you can kind of parse it logically

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
once you've taken a look at it, which is it'll be DSC-,

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
then it'll be the year 2004- the month- the day.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That way there can be no confusion

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
because you're going in descending order.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Whereas if you do it, if you do date or month

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
at the beginning, then Europeans and Americans

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
will be confused if there's a month and day

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
or both under 12.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So that's what I'm gonna stick with for now.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I'm sure lots of people have other opinions,

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but it's almost majority rules with what I've heard.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Another thing that I was asked, let me see,

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
there was an email that I got from a source code listener

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
in New Zealand.

119
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Oops cut out there for a second. I don't know what happened. I hope everything's okay. Yeah, we're still recording

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Wow sounds all of a sudden like it all the stuff is dropping out is that the box here

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Uh-oh. Let me just pause this for one second, see what's going on.

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Okay, I'm not really sure what was going wrong, but most of my mic was cutting out, so I didn't want to lose all the recording, so I just made sure that this file was safe temporarily, and then I paused it and I'm back up now, exactly where we left off.

123
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:48,500
So I was back to a source code listener from New Zealand who says, look, I've got really limited bandwidth here, so I can't use iPod or I do want to listen to the show, but sometimes the topics just don't interest me, and could you post a list about everything you're talking about in the show so I can decide whether to download it or not.

124
00:09:48,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Now I have been setting as the album field in the ID3 tags, I've been setting something that's kind of a highlight or a main theme of the show. I don't even know if that actually shows up, I think it does show up on the iPod.

125
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I will, from now on, I'll also add that one little line, sometimes it's just one or two words, I'll add that to the description of each source code update, which will also show up on the iPod.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and on the website, dailysourcecode.com.

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So you can decide if you want to download or not.

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But like for instance, yesterday, the album title

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that I used, the album title tag,

130
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
it in, birds singing, you know, so what does that mean?

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, you know, that may or may not be a good way

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to make a decision if you're gonna download something

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
or not, but I'm gonna do that

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
because it does seem like it's worth it.

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And also, you know, for my own good,

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and probably if you're listening,

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
if you're going back through an archive,

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you can say, wait a minute, what show was that?

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was the show where he went outside

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and the birds were singing, you know,

141
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
if you see birds singing, you'll remember that.

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So.

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
helpful because there's a lot of ground that we cover in the show. Which brings me to another

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
request which plenty of people have been talking about is providing resource links. And Steve

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ivy and I actually did post a link to his thoughts about this. It's cutting out again.

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I hope it's going to, I hope it holds out. Steve Ivy posted an idea how we could automate

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
this and this is really weird. This is not, this should not be doing this. I have a feeling that

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
something, some application is open that's dragging stuff down, but I can't really see,

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
no, I don't have anything else open. Well, we'll just live with it for now. But of course, I'd love

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to, you know, put up a little file with each posting saying, oh, here's all the links I

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
talked about. And really the way, the way, the reason I'm not doing it is because I'm just too lazy,

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you know, I can't, you know, I'm talking about stuff and then, you know, do I, do I write it down as

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm talking about it?

154
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
We don't have a production assistant.

155
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
There are no production assistants.

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
someone and there's a weblog URL associated with each person there.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So that may be tough unless you put something together where maybe as you're talking, if

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you drag a bookmark onto a folder or something, it would set a tag and also record the time.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Something like that.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I mean, again, the only reason I'm not doing this, I'm just too lazy to listen to the

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
whole show again and jot everything down.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Maybe in the future.

163
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But there may be some technological things that we can do together and that we can

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
create that will actually make some of that happen all by itself.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But check out that link to Steve Ivy's thoughts on that.

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And again, that's from my weblog live.curry.com.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it's just a beautiful day on the iPod or developers list, which you can find

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
a Yahoo groups after yesterday's source code where I said, you know,

169
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
actually, I gave a little review of iPod or X, which is, you know,

170
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Oh, these guys are getting so close to what I think is the perfect.

171
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Today we're drinking a Schweppes bitter lemon straight from the bottle.

172
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
So anyway, iPodRx is great.

173
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
There's no installation.

174
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,500
You just double click it, opens up, and it has...

175
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Wait a minute, that was...

176
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
I'm sorry, I'm gonna say yesterday was iSpider.

177
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Today is iPodRx.

178
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
So iSpider was really happy about because of the install process.

179
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Now iPodRx came out, which I pointed to today.

180
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
And this is not something you install.

181
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,500
It's an application and you launch it and then it shows up and it's real simple.

182
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
How often do you want to check?

183
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
What feeds are we checking?

184
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
And it shoves everything over to your iPod.

185
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
It doesn't tell you or give you an update.

186
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
where all the new stuff is downloaded to.

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But that's just a simple little feature that can be put in.

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it understands bit torrents.

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I presume that since it's Python,

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that it's also cross-platform.

191
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I saw someone else working on a GUI for Windows.

192
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So we're getting really close.

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But what was so beautiful is that,

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and this did happen off-list.

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I've asked these guys, when they're ready to go back

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is that as far as I can tell,

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
iSpider, PyPotter, and iPotterX are going to join forces

198
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and create one single application.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Because it was great to see this.

200
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's like the iSpider guy said,

201
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
hey, this is really cool.

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Would you mind sharing the code of iPotterX?

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And then they all got together

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and they did include me on the conversation.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I'm so excited.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is so wonderful to see this happen.

207
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I think that we'll be pretty much done

208
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
with the iPotter, with the basic core elements,

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
at least from a Mac OSX perspective,

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and considering it's Python underneath.

211
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
which you'll be able to get the Windows gooey up pretty soon.

212
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I think that we're gonna be set.

213
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
In the iPodRex, I just wanted to mention,

214
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
it doesn't install anything,

215
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
so it doesn't actually put a system level cron job in

216
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
or anything, but what's nice about it is

217
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
it's, they've tricked out the application,

218
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
so you launch it and then it goes away, it hides itself.

219
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
If you click on the application again,

220
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
it'll bring up the window,

221
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
and the minute you hit another window,

222
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
or it's just gone, it disappears.

223
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
So it kinda gives the illusion that it's

224
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
running there and I think a lot of people do like the idea of being able to say, hey,

225
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I don't want to run you anymore because you're crunching my bandwidth or whatever and then

226
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
just quit the application.

227
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,500
So real simple to set up in your startup items, which I think a lot of people can't

228
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,500
have figured out how to do that and if not, it's real simple to keep it in your dock

229
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
and just to open it up.

230
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,500
So kudos to the iSpider, the Pi Potter and the iPodRx teams who are now working together

231
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,500
and I think they're going to cope with something absolutely phenomenal.

232
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Cruising through my subscription, some stuff that came in today, I know that yesterday I

233
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:18,500
played you a bit of Raster Web Audio and there is a name behind this genius behind Raster

234
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Web and that is Paul Pete Produl and he has a weblog at RasterWeb.net.

235
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So yesterday you had this joke about a pole and a bar,

236
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and today there was a follow up that came in.

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This is Raster Web Jokey for whatever day it is.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So a guy walks into a pole and the stripper says,

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
hey, do you mind?

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm trying to use this pole.

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I mean, do I come to where you work and get on your desk?

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank you and good night.

243
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ha ha ha.

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And there was another file attached to it.

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It actually was a separate file.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm just going to play that one as well,

247
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
because it's a different joke.

248
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then I want to talk about this concept.

249
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Welcome to Raster Web Audio for the 21st of September, 2004.

250
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I got home late tonight, so I'm making a pizza real quick.

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I looked at the cooking instructions.

252
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The first instruction, do not eat pizza without cooking.

253
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So upon reading that, I immediately stopped eating it.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The second thing it says is, do not allow pizza to thaw.

255
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Now I wasn't sure how to put it in the oven and bake it

256
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
without having it thaw from the heat.

257
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
So I'm not quite sure what to do now.

258
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I think I'm probably just going to eat the instructions and then call it a day.

259
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
So that's about it.

260
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Thank you and good night.

261
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Thank you and good night.

262
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:52,500
And as I was laughing about these jokes or comedy bits, I was thinking, this is so valid.

263
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,500
If I have a playlist of stuff that I'm listening to, which usually is just my what's new playlist,

264
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
any new audio posts or shows that come in are in one.

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
on the iPod through i...

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
smart playlist, then you can say, okay, it has to be speech or anything containing these

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
words or this phrase or anything new in this playlist that hasn't been played before.

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now there's all different Boolean parameters you can set up and I'm thinking, this is

269
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
so great.

270
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I could be listening to morning coffee notes, then in between as the playlist continues,

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I could get a joke of the day, then it could go to evil genius chronicles, then

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
maybe I'd get a stock analysis and this could be a minute, it could be 15 seconds,

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it could be a...

274
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So anyone out there was thinking, you know, damn, I can't really, you know, this is too

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
much for me to do an entire show and just talk into space that could be complicated.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You know, damn, this is pretty exciting.

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And now what I've done is I'm actually going to, I hadn't queued this up, but I'm going

278
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
to set it up for you.

279
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I can actually I can see here

280
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And the recording is perhaps skipping, so hopefully it didn't skip too much on the recording.

281
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Alright.

282
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
On my web blog I often post a quote of the day and actually I have a category set up

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
for it which is QOTD.

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I said, you know, why don't I just create a feed, an RSS 2.0 with enclosures feed or

285
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
an iPod or feed as I'll call it from now on.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And just a duo spoken quote so you know you can add that to your playlist of stuff

287
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you listen to every single day.

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I'm going to play you today's quote.

289
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The most likely way for the world to be destroyed most experts agree is by accident.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's where we come in.

291
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We're computer professionals.

292
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We cause accidents.

293
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Nathaniel Bornstein.

294
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There you go.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So if you're out there and you just want to add some little thing to the mix,

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
it doesn't have to be a general topic.

297
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It could be the weather in Montclair, New Jersey.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You know, it could be all kinds of things.

299
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And it could be really short, which will be a great way to kind of get your feet wet.

300
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,500
and try some of this stuff out and I think that there's a huge potential because you watch then we're going to figure out how to

301
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Create scripts that will you know build special?

302
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Playlist menus for you so you can really compile your own radio show or as I've been reading around the web as people have been talking

303
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
About the iPod and iPod platform

304
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,500
It's Tevo for mp3 right on now an audiobook review

305
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
it's been about a week since I've last did one and

306
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Had another I had a book credit on audible. That's really why I was bored and I would go check out a book

307
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
I still have snow crashed the unabridged version, which is about

308
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
17 hours altogether and I haven't started that one yet

309
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,500
And I didn't know what to get no, you know, I didn't really want a real long read. That's a read there and quotation marks

310
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
And so I went to my favorite section

311
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Which is the staff?

312
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
tips and

313
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
So there's the entire staff of audible

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
is it staff tips or staff picks? Let me see. Staff picks, right. And I'm scrolling down

315
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and they have little pictures of the staff next to their their picks. And I stop at this

316
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
one guy. His name is Brian. And he is the executive VP of content. And I'm like, okay, you know,

317
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
so clearly this is the guy who's, I guess the buck stops with him as it comes to,

318
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
you know, what content is put on. I don't know if that's, you know, what books are

319
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in there or or the content management system or I just don't know. But all

320
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
right, I want to look at what Mark is recommending. And he recommended the

321
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
spoken word revolution, which is by Mark Eleved or a Leaved. I don't know how to

322
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
pronounce that. And it was originally in book form, but the audio book has

323
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
actual recordings. And let me tell you what, I'll just read the blurb here

324
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
for a second. This is Brian's review, which is much better than the explanation

325
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
on the purchase.

326
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,500
The Definite Introductory Course in Spoken Word Poetry starts with a nod to the beats,

327
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,500
then takes you on a journey through hip-hop, performance art, and slams.

328
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
It's an intellectual and emotional tour de force comprised of a few short explanatory

329
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,500
essays about performance poetry with poems performed by the poets who wrote them.

330
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Articulate use of language is increasingly rare in our culture and articulated speech

331
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,500
is arguably the most powerful tool for change on the planet.

332
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Spoken Word Poetry is powerful articulate speech that deserves wide distribution.

333
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I highly recommend this title for the sheer joy

334
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and for the opportunity to experience the undeniable power of great poetry.

335
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And so I thought, damn, I don't want to listen to poetry. Poetry is boring. But the hip-hop

336
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
reference and performance art and slams kind of got my curiosity up. And I listened to a quick

337
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
sample. I'm not going to play that exact sample. Actually, I'm going to play a part of that sample

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
for you. And I said, all right, I'm going to download this. And it's only an hour and 15

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
minutes. It's not cheap, though. It was $14.95, which I thought was very expensive,

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
compared to John Stewart's book, which was $7.95, and a great audiobook production,

341
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and was much longer in length. But of course, I was getting it for free anyway,

342
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
so that didn't bother me that much. And I was just blown away. I mean, there is some...

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I think this is probably a pure American culture. Of course, if you can speak of pure

344
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
American culture, because the culture comes from all over the world into America.

345
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
to the big melting pot.

346
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And there's a good history lesson throughout this.

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And you can almost listen to it in one commute, or at least in one day's worth of commute.

348
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm going to play a bit for you.

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's a performance piece about television.

350
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And I've often spoken about television being such a hypnotic medium.

351
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In fact, it's probably time again for me to point to the Zen TV experiment.

352
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I always have it on the left-hand blog roll links on my web blog.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But I'll point to it again because television is, it's something else.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And having worked in it with it and for it, I think I know what I'm talking about.

355
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So listen to an excerpt from the spoken word revolution.

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The young child with

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Ah, shit.

358
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Now that sucked.

359
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Excuse me.

360
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I was trying to be so cool.

361
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay.

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Let me do that again.

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Listen to an excerpt from the spoken word revolution.

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:07,000
An audio recording cannot capture the full effect of New York monologous and screenwriter Todd Alcott's compelling performance of television, but we'll give it a try.

365
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
While you listen, imagine a hyper-jittery black-haired chalky complexion boob tube right up in your face.

366
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Look out for the static in the spittle. Mr. Todd Alcott, everyone.

367
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Television.

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look over there. There's nothing to look at over there.

369
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Are you looking at me? Is everybody looking at me? Do I have everyone's attention?

370
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to take over your life. You need what? What do you need? What do you need? You need to what?

371
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Go to the bathroom? Fine. Get up. Go to the bathroom. Come back. Look at me. You need what? You need to get something to eat? Fine.

372
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Get up. Go to the kitchen. Get something to eat. Come back. Look at me. You need to what? What? What? Sleep? Fine.

373
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Get up. Go to bed. Go to sleep. Get up. Come back. Look at me. Okay. So, we have an agreement.

374
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
You will do what you absolutely have to do and when you're done, you will come back and

375
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
look at me.

376
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Don't worry about your schedule.

377
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
I am here for you.

378
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
I am here for you.

379
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,500
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, I am here for you.

380
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I am here for you.

381
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
You need me.

382
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm here.

383
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Fair and foul, thick and thin, I am here for you.

384
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
I am here for you.

385
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
People try to tell you I'm bad.

386
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
You tell them that I am bad.

387
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I am here for you, pe-

388
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,500
grapes.

389
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Death Drills comedy all here all in the next eight minutes. Can you believe it? You can't believe it. You can't believe it

390
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
It's unbelievable. You can't believe it

391
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Look at me. Oh man, how good is that? And perhaps this guy should try decaf

392
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
All right more thoughts about what we can do with these wonderful with this wonderful

393
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
iPodder and the

394
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
podcasting is

395
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Something else that I've been a lot of people have been using this as an example and we'll say well imagine

396
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You could listen to your favorite NPR shows which of course you can get on the internet

397
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You can listen to it on radio stations around the country

398
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There's you know, there's there's different ways to get it, but it's not available in download form yet

399
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And so this example is used very often, you know, so the iPodder

400
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, it's perfect because then instead of having to tune into your favorite NPR show

401
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
you could

402
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You have it automatically stored on your on your mp3 player and then whenever it's convenient for you

403
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You can listen to the most recent show

404
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And in fact until streaming that came on vogue and I've never been a big fan of streaming in fact I've always been

405
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,500
trying to shift the transfer of data to when I'm sleeping, because then it doesn't bother

406
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,500
me. There's no click and wait. This is my infamous last yard essay that I wrote. You can just

407
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,500
type into Google, Adam Curry, last yard, and it'll pop up.

408
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
And so the answer is, of course, that would be wonderful. And all that we need is just

409
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,500
one person who maybe isn't quite ready to do their own audio show, but is interested

410
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,500
in contributing and wants to help out with some cool stuff that we can all

411
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,500
listen to. If you take Audio Hijack Pro as an example, you can set it, it has a timer

412
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,500
function built in, and you can set your stream to, it can actually talk to a URL.

413
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,500
You can say, hey, open up this application, so real player, open it up with this URL,

414
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,500
which would be the URL for the most recent or at two o'clock whenever, you know,

415
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,500
what is it, car talk or whatever show comes on. And it'll automatically record

416
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
that right away to a file. And with a little bit of automation that could be

417
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
an Apple script or it could be Jake's DIR2RSS script, a whole bunch of different...

418
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It would just auto upload that show and you could have this practically running in the background of any

419
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
any modern day PC and

420
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It would make a lot of people happy now. I'm not sure about the legalities of this of course

421
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So let me just put that caveat caveat in there

422
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But you know, maybe the NPR guys and gals will get a clue and start doing that for

423
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
All right time for a song of the day and there's a bit of a story that goes along with that

424
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
After this is this song

425
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Of course he recently passed away

426
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
In Montrose, Switzerland

427
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Well I met him

428
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
About eleven years ago

429
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
He's every kind of people

430
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Make one life's a pocket.

431
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Every kind of people

432
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Make the world go round.

433
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Someone's looking for a way

434
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
It is beautiful

435
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:29,500
It takes every kind of people to make the world go round

436
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Go round, round, round, round

437
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Robert Foller, every kind of people on the source code for Tuesday, September 21,

438
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
2004.

439
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I hope the skipping isn't too bad.

440
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'll listen back to the show to see if most of it's on.

441
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
my outburst when the wrong song got queued up there. That was another problem because I

442
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
have this wonderful DJ 1800 deck player but if I want to play an excerpt from an audio book

443
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I have to use iTunes because of the DRM. It won't play on anything else but iTunes or

444
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
on the iPod. But of course it was simple just play iTunes and just route the audio through

445
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
to Audio Hijack Pro you know so much for the DRM stuff. So Robert Palmer used to be

446
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
well this I think still every single year there's the Montrose Jazz Festival which

447
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
is held in Montrose Switzerland and it's a there's a big casino there and and

448
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that's where the Rock Festival where the Jazz Festival is held and it used to

449
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
be back in the up until I think like 90 maybe 92 or 93 one or two weeks just

450
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
before the Jazz Festival would be the Montrose Rock Festival and that kind of

451
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
stem from a story that you know the song Deep Purple Smoke on the Water in fact

452
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
let me just consult iTunes while we're talking about it

453
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:04,500
They were recording in a studio which at the time I believed belonged to Queen.

454
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
If not, it does now.

455
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Hold on, let's see if I have smoke on the water here.

456
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Just a quick search for smoke.

457
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Shoot, no, don't have.

458
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Anyway, the casino caught on fire while they were there recording in Montreux.

459
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
If you listen to the lyrics and I'll have to get that tomorrow, it's just too much hassle

460
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
to try and download it while I'm...

461
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The Lyricos see we all went down to Mantro yada yada yada smoke on the water

462
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Fire in the sky because it was looking out over Lake Geneva and the smoke was coming from the casino over the water

463
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Anyway, I digress and I apologize

464
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So we were there with MTV and this must have been 88 or 89 and a lot of the big European acts would would be there

465
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and let's see Steve Wynwood was there and Robert Palmer who has a house there in Montrose,

466
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Switzerland was also at the festival and I was interviewing them right right on the side

467
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
of Lake Geneva.

468
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
We had two chairs out kind of on the promenade and it was a beautiful sunny afternoon early

469
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
afternoon and we're chatting away and and you know the cameras have this video footage

470
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
somewhere the cameras really close up on him and he's telling me.

471
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Look at this bird here who's coming down.

472
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Hey, look at this bird.

473
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
And so I turn the look and it's Patricia.

474
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
And I say, yeah, that's my fiance.

475
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,500
And we have this perfect close up of Robert Palmer turning beat red.

476
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
It was fantastic.

477
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
And of course we really do miss him.

478
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
He passed away way too young.

479
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,500
He was in his early 50s and we do miss Robert Palmer.

480
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
And that's it for the source code for today.

481
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I'm going to go check the file, see if we have lots of skipage or if it's broadcastable

482
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
or should I say podcastable.

483
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
And I will be with you tomorrow for another...

484
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000

See you all next time.

486
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
The power of your intelligence.
