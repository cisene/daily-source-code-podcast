1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm a Korean, it's Wednesday September 15th 2004.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
even be tomorrow.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this is the place where users and developers party

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
together.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's the daily source code.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And I discovered something horrible today.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I was I registered for some, I was looking at different

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
services, that's what it was, for voiceover IP, still in my

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
ultimate quest to find a voiceover IP provider that

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
actually gives me dial-up numbers in multiple countries.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And excuse me, that's a cup of tea there.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And I've learned that when you register for something online,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
when they say we'll send you an email, usually the first

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
place you need to look is your junk mail folder, because

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that's probably where that type of email is going to show up,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
something in the algorithm that always sends it there.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And so I was looking, I just kind of on a fluke.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now I'm using Apple's mail program, and I actually have

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
it running through mac.com.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So if you send an email to curry.com, it's routed

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
through mac.com.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The reason why is because they have built-in spam filters.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's still a lot of stuff that

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
I've just manually wanted to filter out.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,500
And boy, was I surprised when I just did a little quick search

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
for iPodder and for source code.

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I have missed a lot of email, and I apologize

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
that I haven't checked earlier.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
There were some messages that date back to August.

30
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Like, whoops.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
So I just wanted to run through a couple of pieces of mail

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
that I found in my junk mail box, because a lot of them

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
were responses to the show.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Here's one from Danny.

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
You see, he said, you asked for a reason as to why Skype

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
is better than standard SIP protocols.

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Now, we talked about that.

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,500
So what's the big difference with my question between a lot

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
of these voice over IP service that you see and Skype?

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
So Danny says, very roughly, the primary difference

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
is that SIP, let's just call it SIP,

42
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
depends upon a central server to act as the switch

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
for the voice calls.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Skype has distributed this functionality

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
across all of its users, decentralizing the switch.

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
This only provides greater reliability,

47
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
not having central choke points.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
It also allows Skype folks to operate a huge voice network

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
with a lot of different features.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
having to buy racks and racks of servers to run SIP on. Makes sense. And now I understand,

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
now that I indeed have been looking at how these providers are put together, indeed they're

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
all using Cisco boxes or what's the other one, other dialog box, I can't remember

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
all the names. And they are basically providing that bridge or they're buying that capability.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And the connect point is indeed apparently a centralized service from what I can see.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And maybe there are some decentralized ones, but I'm having good success with Skype.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It really pisses me off that I can't receive phone.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I had a phone call with my secretary today.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She's in Amsterdam.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm in Belgium.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I Skyped her.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Notice how that's becoming synonymous to an internet phone

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
call.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I Skyped her.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And we went through at least about, was it actually?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Look at it here.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
19 minutes on the phone.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It was a long distance country to country call.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Normally I'm probably paying because we're calling between

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
cell phones just out of, just because we're lazy.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm probably paying at least a dollar.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And now I think I paid 30 cents for the entire conversation.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And you know what?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There's always room for more money.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So spending less equals the same thing in my book.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Another email from Michael.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's see what Michael had to say here.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He says that he discovered daily source code just

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
yesterday.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now this was sent almost two weeks ago.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's become absolutely addicted to audio blogs.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He spent the entire day learning about RSS feeds

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and enclosures.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And he says that he'd only seen these terms in passing

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
when reading about the upcoming Safari RSS iteration.

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
So he's clearly enjoying it.

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,500
And let me see, why did I want to talk about this email?

87
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Oh, he's talking about an audio setup.

88
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Okay, when listening to your recordings, I was struck by the fidelity.

89
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
My ask what mic software encoder setup you are using.

90
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm working on an Apple platform as well,

91
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
but I struggle to determine exactly what mic and software to use to give everybody a good sound.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Appreciate it, blah, blah, blah.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, Michael.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So let me tell you how I'm doing this.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
First of all, the key to doing this type of show

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is to be able to record any sound

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that comes out of your computer speakers.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In this case, I'm on a Mac,

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and unless you physically plug something into the line out

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and into a recording device,

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
it's kind of hard to figure out how to do that.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There's a little application called WireTap for OS X.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And when you fire that up,

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it will basically record anything

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
that is sent through the speakers.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So anything you can hear on the speakers,

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
including when I turn up my volume, listen to this.

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
So you heard the little blips there of me turning up the volume.

109
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
All of that is recorded.

110
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,500
And it's recorded unfortunately to an AIFF file which I then later have to transcode

111
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
to MP3.

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
The reason I do that is so that I can use QuickTime as my media player.

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
So my opening tune is a QuickTime window.

114
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Then all the bits I want to play, if I want to play an MPEG movie or a QuickTime

115
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
In fact, I'm going to do that today. I have a couple of those queued up. Now you still

116
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
need to get your mic in. There are different ways to do that. Basically, any program that

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
will allow your microphone, your internal mic, or your external one, which I'll talk

118
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
about in a second, to be played through your speakers will be perfect. Now, in this case,

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm using GarageBand, since I had the iLife Suite anyway. What's nice about GarageBand

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
is you can set up filters and compressors. I just actually changed some of the settings.

121
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I had a noise gate in there before. The reason why I use a noise gate is so when

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
there's a certain level of quiet in the room, then the microphone will just shut

123
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,500
off, so you don't hear any ancillary noise. It's probably most often used

124
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
for musical recordings of instruments, but we use it in radio studios all the time.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I'll give you an example of what it sounds like. I've turned the gate on and you

126
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
hear that when I breathe, when I stop breathing, if there's not enough

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
ambient noise, then the gate cuts in and it shuts off the recording.

128
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
And so you can set this a little bit looser to the top of it now.

129
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Okay.

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
So you see that's what a gate is.

131
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Then you have things like a compressor which gives you a little more boost to the sound.

132
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm going to turn my compressor on right now.

133
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Now if you're listening to me on an iPod or you're listening through some big speakers,

134
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
my voice is probably booming into the room right now.

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
And that by the way is, oh, you get that big ass radio voice.

136
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Okay, so let's turn that off.

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Excuse me.

138
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,500
And for microphone, I'm using a pretty interesting, I'm using a wireless set that we have left over

139
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,500
from our reality TV show that we produced ourselves.

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
These are, what the hell are these things?

141
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Electro, L-E-C-T-R-O, UHF wireless microphones.

142
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And these are professional.

143
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
These are pretty expensive.

144
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,500
This set costs me about, I think, 2,000 euros.

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
It's about, yeah, about $22 to $2,500.

146
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
But you can use all different types of microphones.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And I found that if you go to Radio Shack and you buy one of their metal stick microphones,

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
which looks very much like a Shure microphone, an old fashioned Shure microphone.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I should actually, well, I'm sorry for the, for the feedback there, but I had to unplug

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the headphones.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I walk over to my microphone cabinet.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Pretty sure.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I probably still have one of those laying here.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Got all my good mics.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Shoot.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No. Okay.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can't find the, unfortunately I can't find it, but I'll look that up.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll see if I can find what model number it is.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you can get that into your Macintosh, then there's all this process in it you can do.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There's also, there's all kinds of different programs.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There are a lot of mixing programs that will let you filter the audio on a particular channel

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and play it through so that you can hear it on the speakers.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Again, if you hear it on the speakers, wire tap is.

164
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,500
going to record it. So one thing you're going to get used to is using the mute button on

165
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,500
the program using to get your microphone on to the speakers so that I just turn it off

166
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,500
and turn it back on because when you're playing something you clearly don't want any noise

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,500
that you're making to be recorded as well. So you have to learn to shut your mic off.

168
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,500
One more email. Oh the email bag is big today. Hi Adam this is from Julio. Oh this

169
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
is cool. Just start listening to the daily source code. Want to tell you it's great.

170
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,500
I listened to it on my commute in the

171
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Caracas.

172
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
The subway system here in Caracas, Venezuela.

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Hey, we got Caracas on the wireless everybody.

174
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Um, so, and this is another email that was in the junk mail folder and so Julio says

175
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I guess someone must have answered your questions from the September...

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and here it goes. This was about the the iPhoto getting in a CD or DVD of iPhoto's

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
when you put it back in you know the whole thing that that iPhoto actually

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
boots back up and makes it look just like they're sitting on your hard drive.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So if I'd gotten that earlier then I would have known earlier. Thank you.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And also apparently in iTunes as I said you can select the iPod references and

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
choose manually manage songs and playlists. After that you can erase

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
all your files from the computer clearing up space and they will remain on your iPod.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Interesting. Downside you have to move files in manually. Upside you can connect

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
your iPod to other Macs listed in Music Audit just not just your own Mac.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay so that's some iTunes tips from Julio checking us out from Caracas.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Excellent. And today is a very exciting day here at Curry Castle.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's September and that means it is time to harvest.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Aha! Horticulture on the source code you think. Well indeed.

189
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,500
A couple months ago, I was given by my friendly coffee shop, Purple Rain in Breda, which is

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
about 25 minutes drive north of here in Holland.

191
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Five wonderful little marijuana plants, of which, well I put them all in our, we have

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
a little greenhouse, I started growing them a couple months ago.

193
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I didn't know anything about it, you know, just checked a few things on the internet,

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,500
didn't really look into how you're supposed to do it, and then figure out after several

195
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
months and after these plants were just huge, I figured out, you know, you have to

196
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,500
control their light cycle in order to get them to bloom, because that's the stuff

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
that you want to cut off.

198
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,500
And so what I did is I set up a little thing down in the basement, brought the

199
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
plants down, and these were almost like mini shrubs, they're like trees at this

200
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,500
point, and started cultivating them underneath light, 12 hours on, 12 hours

201
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
off, and then bring that cycle down.

202
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Since they were outdoor plants moved indoor, eventually four of them didn't.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
make it and they like boom just died overnight which really sucked and I've

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
had one left and it's pretty humongous we think we're going to be able to cut

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
quite a lot off of it never done the cutting before and of course we have

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to dry everything so that is on this evening schedule we're going to watch

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
television and we're going to cut all the little buds off the plant and hang

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
up to dry and I will you know what and I think we should do I think that takes

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
at least a week maybe even longer to dry him we'll have to celebrate together on

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the source code and I'll spark one up for you and pass a virtual doobie let's see

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
just running through the news man Ivan possibly on its way to Louisiana maybe

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
by the time you hear this it's already hit that's really intense you know I've

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
been there a couple times from already brought with MTV broadcasts great

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
town and probably probably won't be able to withstand a big storm like that

215
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,500
very well and also the geographical location. Topographical location isn't very advantageous

216
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,500
as all the news media is telling us. And I wanted to mention Oprah briefly because her

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,500
big Pontiac giveaway did not go unnoticed here either. So just to let you all know that

218
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,500
if you think that maybe giving away, was it 260, $28,000 cars, if that was a bad

219
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
idea while I'm telling you, everyone knows about the Pontiac here in Holland and they

220
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,500
probably never even heard of Pontiacs before. So that really worked. Big and

221
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,500
excellent, excellent PR move by Oprah and Pontiac. And yesterday I played some bits

222
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:34,500
of Fahrenheit 9-11 and got some interesting responses to that. I think most

223
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
people seem to agree with me. You know the message is clear but the way it was

224
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
all cut up was just almost unnecessary to do it that way. I was really

225
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,500
interested in the historical part of what this documentary is supposed to show.

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
which definitely was there, but all the hokey bits just didn't seem necessary.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And almost, I think, attracted from the message.

228
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So on source code, we do wanna keep to equal air time.

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And I ran across a new documentary, which should be out on DVD very soon,

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
which is probably just as bad as Fahrenheit 9-11.

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is called Fahrenheit 9-11.

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And it has some saluminaries in there who go on record talking about

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Michael Moore's documentary, most notably Ed Koch, former mayor of New York City.

234
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm just gonna play the trailer so you can enjoy this bit of equal air time

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
programming Fahrenheit 9-11.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I probably should have queued that out. There's a whole bunch of what you're seeing right

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
now on the screen is a whole bunch of reviews just like to do in the movies where it says

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Michael Moore best film, most important film ever. So it goes through that and here comes

239
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Ed Koch.

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
man who says that the units have spread misery throughout the world.

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come on.

242
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Michael Moore, I'm a safe shallow.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The terrorist threat is real. It's every day it's real.

244
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I said 3,000 people were murdered!

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
How the f*** do you say this?

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Someone has to explain that nobody took it seriously before George Bush on 9-11.

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Iraq was a war for oil. That's just propaganda, but out of the rocket, felt grenades.

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And 60 million years.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Somebody's been slipping past the sanctions.

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, fuck that one. They're all the same.

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Everybody wanted to defend Sadami, saying they don't like him at all.

252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's the first second day of war they wanted to escape.

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The biggest thing on their mind was their families, their lives.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's it. They didn't care about stuff.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I thank God we have the baby on the actual...

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's amazing about this war...

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
President Bush said, I will do whatever it takes.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You call out war from the get-go, and that really defined the war on terrorism.

259
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The fear for abusive freedom of speech in society is more freedom of speech than a channel.

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Somebody can sleep last night by a friend.

261
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Like Ron Reagan and Latchel was good.

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Michael Moore's film, in trying to knock our liberty, and trying to say that we don't have it,

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
is the best illustration of how wrong his film is.

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh for

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Fahrenheit 9 1 1 savage pictures Fahrenheit Fahrenheit 9 1 1

266
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Dot com okay, you can go check that out so much for the equal error

267
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know what it's only just a matter of time until someone's gonna come up with a perfect final cut pro edit of both the

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Documentaries and put a against be and it's gonna be a even

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, another video blog post that, actually a video blog post that I wanted to let you

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
hear because this is Steve Garfield who has a very rye sense of humor.

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
In fact, at the rate he's going, he could take those places.

272
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He went out as what he calls a citizen journalist for election day.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Now it happened to be in his particular county was election day for sheriff.

274
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And he went to check out on the polling rules if everyone was adhering to a...

275
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
that are supposed to be written in stone apparently when it comes to polling.

276
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Well, the post kind of speaks for itself. I'm going to play this as well.

277
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And just imagine Steve Garfield standing in front of buildings with people with signs behind him

278
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
and you'll get the video part. It's titled, 150 Feet.

279
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Hi, this is Steve Garfield from SteveGarfield.com.

280
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
It's Election Day in Boston and today's big primary race is the Sheriff's Race.

281
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Not many people seem to be voting today so the story that we're going to look at is

282
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
if the people who are campaigning for any of the candidates are breaking the Massachusetts law

283
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
which says you must stay within 150 feet of a polling place.

284
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Here in Jamaica Plain, the law is being abided by and the candidate supporters are staying well away from the polling place.

285
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Now we're in West Roxbury at the Holy Name Parish voting facility where we can obviously see

286
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,500
that these campaign workers are well within the 150 foot legal limit where they're supposed to be.

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
be out in the street and not the front steps. Has anyone from the polling place here told

288
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
you about the law where campaigners need to be 150 feet away from the polling place?

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, they haven't said that today.

290
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So were you aware of that?

291
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So what are we right here? How close are we?

293
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, it depends on what you're counting. Where you measure it to, if you're measuring

294
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
to where the actual votes are taken, we're outside that 150 feet.

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I notice you're pretty close to the...

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
uh...

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
law which is supposed to be like a hundred fifty feet away

298
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
uh... yes we are right now it's very slow there's nothing going on but as

299
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
people start coming in

300
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
so where would the polling place actually be like

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
where does it start

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
right here at the building?

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
yes it does right there and i know that's a hundred fifty feet

304
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
so if they enforce if they actually enforce that law where we would

305
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Really, that's fire.

306
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Rocksbury Branch Library and it's our third stop today.

307
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So I guess we could say we're two out of three because look at these people.

308
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
These campaigners are right in front of the doorstep of the library.

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Steven Murphy, Marion Walsh, everybody signs,

310
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
posted right up to the lamppost of the library. This is ridiculous.

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
This law of staying within 150 feet of any polling place is just

312
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
not being enforced two out of three times. I'd say if I went to ten more

313
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
places, I bet you there'd be people all over the front of these polling places.

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So that's something that I think's got to change. I always drive by

315
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and am so upset when I see people swarming right over the front door. This is not right.

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You know, I just don't like it. This is Steve Garfield reporting for

317
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
SteveGarfield.com. Excellent. Steve Garfield

318
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
protecting democracy on the streets of Boston

319
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and very proud of him for doing that because it doesn't matter how trivial the law

320
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is. That's those are the rules. Before you know it, you're debating over

321
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
hanging people.

322
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,500
chats. Let's talk about enclosures for a second. There's, oh first of all, good new, well let

323
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:27,500
me just back up for a second. Enclosures is really part of the technology that we're

324
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,500
using for iPodder. If you haven't used it yet, check out iPodder.org and download one of

325
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
these programs either for Mac or for Windows or even for Linux. They're all out there

326
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,500
for iTunes, they're out there for Windows Media Player and if you have an MP3 device

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I want to dry them off.

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So if you have a MP3 player that works on Windows Media,

329
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
then do something about that feedback.

330
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then you're good to go.

331
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So how this is done is by creating an RSS 2.0 feed,

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
which is basically just a text file which

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
has some fairly human readable words in it.

334
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And they represent little bytes of information,

335
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
so a blog post typically.

336
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And to each of those postings, you can attach a file.

337
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
In this case, for the iPodder and for what

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
we're doing with the source code and other programs like this,

339
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is we attach a URL to an MP3 file.

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And as far as I know, I think really only Radio User Land

341
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
has it built into the blogging interface.

342
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If you make a web blog post, for instance,

343
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I say, hey, it's daily source code for September 15, 2004.

344
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
MP3, it's going to be a great day.

345
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
be about 35 minutes or 30 minutes.

346
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
It's this big.

347
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
And then I just add the URL to wherever that file is located.

348
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I add that in a little box that says Enclosure URL.

349
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
And then it attaches it.

350
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
And then my RSS feed goes out without enclosure attached to

351
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
it.

352
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Word is that another great weblogs package called Word

353
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Press, which I'm very impressed with.

354
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
They're now working.

355
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
There are a couple of people working.

356
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I saw some Dutch guys.

357
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
It's in fact working on adding enclosure support to Word

358
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Press, which will be great to have.

359
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
And there's lots of people supporting this effort.

360
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
So I'm sure that's going to show up pretty soon.

361
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Andrew Grumit has also started an audio blog.

362
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Or he started audio blogging.

363
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Let's put it that way.

364
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
And I wanted to play an excerpt, which I haven't queued up.

365
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I just realized of Andrew talking about iPod and iTunes

366
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
and how that really is going to be, how iTunes is going

367
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
to be a killer app.

368
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Let me just skip through this with you for a second.

369
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Let's listen to Andrew's post here.

370
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Good evening.

371
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Andrew Grumit, it's September 14th, 2004, about 945.

372
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hold on, I'm gonna fast forward you Andrew.

373
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You decide a pub date is for a file that was created.

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay, so a whole bunch of techy stuff in there

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
about when, you know, what kind of information

376
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
is to be in the RSS 2.0 file.

377
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Users might wanna listen to it,

378
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
although you might not understand it,

379
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but this is pretty important stuff,

380
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
so we can get these iPodder programs working properly.

381
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Let me see.

382
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So that's probably, I'm gonna probably leave it there

383
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
unless I get strong feedback that it's just unworkable.

384
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay.

385
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Let's see.

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Adam Curry had some nice ideas,

387
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
one of which was that the, I think he noted that,

388
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I've putter type scripts on the extraction side, go and use the ID3 tag data to...

389
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is about publishing using ID3 tags.

390
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Set up playlists and so forth.

391
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's not the bit I want to...

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So should the publishing scripts go dig into the ID3 tags and...

393
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I have to talk about it.

394
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So I went ahead and added some to the script.

395
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Hold on a second.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I have the Perl.

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I had to learn a little bit of stuff.

398
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It was...

399
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I sort of generalized...

400
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I really should have queued this up for you.

401
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So it's sort of a mini plug-in architecture.

402
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay, now go for it.

403
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay, so, oh, and Adam also had an observation about ease of use.

404
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And it's definitely true.

405
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is kind of a geek script.

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't expect everybody to set up cron jobs on their server.

407
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It happened to be the easiest thing for me.

408
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And what my idea was to combine it with Radio User Land upstreaming so that what

409
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I can do is drag my audio file to a folder.

410
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It gets upstreamed by FTP.

411
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
At some point a cron job...

412
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,500
comes along and sees the new file and regenerates the RSS feed. So that's how I'm going to do it.

413
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:56,500
But anyone is, the audience or the developer group who might be listening is more than invited to

414
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:03,500
copy everything I've done and make it work really nicely on the desktop or use the ideas as a basis

415
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,500
for, you know, steel-free-lead basically. Which is exactly what we want to see on the

416
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,500
iPod or dev mailing list. So what Andrew was talking about there was about his DIR2 RSS script,

417
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,500
which creates an RSS 2.0 file. Again, we're getting more and more blog software to support this, so

418
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,500
that's going to get easier for users in the future. Now I think it's the part where he talks

419
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:37,500
about the media players. Oh, last thing. I wanted to talk about a usability strategy, I guess,

420
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
something I did with my iPod that seems kind of useful. I think other people have noted that

421
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
iTunes has this thing called the smart playlist and you can tell the smart

422
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
playlist. You can tell it you want the last 10 items added to your iPod, you

423
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
know, ordered, if I reverse chronological date added, and so that's really a great

424
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
way. That for me is the killer app. You know, I just want to go into the iPod,

425
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you know, go to my latest playlist and just sort of, you know, hit play at the top

426
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and have it go down through the last few things added. And one little trick is that

427
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it seems to, the iPod wants to display the list alphabetically. So it seems like,

428
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
so I went in and I renamed my latest playlist to 00 latest, which bubbles it up to the top,

429
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
so there's even less work. So that seems to be working well and maybe it'll work well for you.

430
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay, that's all I have to say and I'm going to go ahead and try publishing this with the latest version of

431
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
my script and we'll see how it goes.

432
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Well it worked Andrew.

433
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Take care everybody.

434
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Thank you very much.

435
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
So that's interesting there.

436
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Again we spoke about that yesterday where your media player is starting to look a little bit...

437
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,500
a playlist but it's the same thing as rules and you can call it a playlist you

438
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:05,500
can call it a folder. I mean this nuance is everything in this. And on the list

439
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,500
further I'm seeing a lot of people now talk about hey you know this is so

440
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
successful we should start setting ourselves up for other types of

441
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,500
enclosures like video and applications and this is where I want to see like a

442
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
back off the developers a little bit because we're gonna get ahead of

443
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,500
ourselves. We still need to get the right installers already I posted today

444
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,500
there's a Windows configuration tool for the Windows iPodder which is great

445
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,500
but on on install I'll just run you through the steps that typical user will

446
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,500
need you know and from a Mac OS X OS 10 perspective obviously and we download

447
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,500
this you know a sit file or whatever it could be a DMG I want it to be a disc

448
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,500
image at a certain point that opens up it says double click here it's probably an

449
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Apple script a double click it sets up my cron job and it pops up a dialogue

450
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,500
and says iPodder will run at these times and make it 3 a.m.

451
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
8am, 11pm, whatever, and you could check off or maybe check a few more hours as options.

452
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And that's going to be set up in your cron job, it's going to make it run.

453
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And then it's going to say, you're subscribed to these feeds automatically and you can deselect

454
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
any one of them you want to.

455
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And it's also going to tell you how you can add another feed to it, which should

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
be able to be done after the install.

457
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And really that's it.

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The only other thing you'd want perhaps is just a hello world thing to make your user

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
really happy.

460
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Where you've installed this thing, it should go out, it should download an mp3 from,

461
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
you know, just a set mp3 that's always there in an rss file that never changes.

462
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And it'll be, hi, hello world.

463
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You have successfully installed the iPod.

464
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And of course that should transfer onto the iPod or whatever device.

465
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That should be put into a special hello world welcome playlist.

466
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And I think that once we've got all that set up and users are able to just download

467
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,000
this.

468
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,500
thing and their iPod is working then we can move on to other types of enclosures.

469
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
And by the time we've got the installation we'll also have other types of devices to

470
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
talk to.

471
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Time for the song of the day.

472
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I was rolling through the iTunes playlist and Patricia and my wife was sitting beside

473
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
me and she said, oh yeah.

474
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,500
This is, are you searching for a song for the source code?

475
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I said oh yeah.

476
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
She said, this has got to be the one then.

477
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
She's missing a rock and roll band and the world plays it.

478
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
They may not know all the words but it's a classic.

479
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
It's a little singing with me and the job.

480
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I can care about him, I saw I kept him there

481
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,500
This one, he was kept him, I worked with two spark-ers

482
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,500
I took all of this money

483
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
And I bought it home to Bali

484
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That's with speed and I'm the job

485
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,500
A

486
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
M

487
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
M

488
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
M

489
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
M

490
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
M

491
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500

Taking my mom and the women

499
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This would be a good job

500
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I am with a ball, a chain, a bunch of rain, dammit.

501
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm going to wrap it up today with just a brief pointer to the new search engine on the scene.

502
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
I was pointed to it by something Dave wrote about it.

503
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Apparently, well, that's something for a different discussion.

504
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,500
But anyway, a9.com, which is certainly less typing to get to than google.com.

505
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Interesting search engine.

506
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm pretty sure they use Google's search engine, but they do have some interesting

507
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
features.

508
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:24,500
You know, your history of searches, you can open up multiple frames for different types

509
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,500
of searches next to each other, such as a search based on web pages, a search based on images.

510
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,500
So definitely worth taking a look at, and probably worth having a conversation with Dave Weiner

511
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
over.

512
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Now, that's a plan.

513
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
And that's it for source code for today.

514
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,500
I'll be back tomorrow with another edition of your daily source code.

515
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,500
