00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey everybody, it's Adam here at Ricky's Highett and Paula Walther.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hold on a second.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I was listening to Coverville in their Abba Special podcast.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just got in, pretty long fight about 14 hours altogether,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and got the Wi-Fi configured, had a quick bite to eat.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm too tired to do a full-blown daily source code,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so I hope you'll excuse me for not doing that.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It looks like Dave and I are going to do a high-quality trade secrets tomorrow,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and yeah, that's the stuff coming up.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sure there'll be plenty of podcasts in the next few days,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so it shouldn't be too bad.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And thank you Don and Drew for the extra long Don and Drew show.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It really helped on the flight.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And I got my Doom bug y'all ready for you by the day.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey, that's it.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Source code tomorrow.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And those of you on your way, Rob BloggerCon.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
See you soon.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Bye.
