1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm casting all's life at a curry.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Just power all the glory of your life.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How do everybody? Good?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Afternoon, good evening, or almost good morning is just a little bit before midnight here on Wednesday, October 27th, 2004,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
coming to you from the bunker in Sin City, home of the coffee shop,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and stood down the nettle that's the source curve.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Power all the glory of your life.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh boy, one of those days,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
didn't get to my email until about 10-15 years ago.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And it's full of all kinds of particular due to an interview that I did today,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
on WNYC.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Without a doubt, New York's premiere,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and I think only public witness to it,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
not be only one in the Tri-State area, mind you.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But yeah, it was really, really good.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're going to review the launch of Apple's new iPods.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And of course there is some audio comments and some RIA for you.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Power all the glory of your life.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I think I talked about this the other day that WNYC

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
released a CD with what I call pod tunes or a music that is free to be used and copied as you wish.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Some well-known names on there, a Beastie Boys, a David Bern by now, of course,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
this thing is circulating around the net.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And if you're hey, if WNYC is going to quit so much push behind these bands,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
they've chosen and they've gone through the trouble of doing this,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
then we might as well participate in everywhere we can.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So on the podcast today, a couple of songs that come off of that CD,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
this is one big holiday.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My morning on the source code.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So I'm going to play some of that.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Was a bad man, man

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can't find him

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Telling I was starting to eat me

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All the way

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Baby

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We'll stay

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We'll stay

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, oh, oh

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Make a way

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll be alright

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We'll be alright

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So we'll let it start

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Up the river

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it's going all around

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We'll stay

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We'll stay

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We'll stay

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, oh, oh

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Make a way

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We'll stay

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, oh, oh

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Make a way

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We'll stay

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, oh, oh

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Make a way

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We'll stay

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, oh, oh

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Make a way

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We'll stay

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, oh, oh

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Make a way

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We'll stay

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, oh, oh

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Make a way

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We'll stay

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, oh, oh

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Make a way

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We'll stay

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, oh, oh

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
One big holiday, my morning

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
From the wire to open source music CD

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It has a name

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, I was second

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That CD had a name, didn't it?

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I couldn't say that

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hold on, let me see

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll look at iTunes right now

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The wire CD volume one, alright

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I could have come up with one myself

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is the source code

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's now officially Thursday

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But we're still going to say this is Wednesday

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
October 27, 2004

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's been on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster the past few days

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Get really excited about what's happening with everything

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All things podcasting

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then my mom's still still going through some tests

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think I might have some reasonably good news to report by tomorrow

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm getting up at six and we're going to the hospital

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We have a 930 appointment

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
One final test that has to be done

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Just to make sure that we can indeed go the surgery route

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Which would be fabulous

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And that is relative to what fabulous really is of course

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So, so it's been kind of up and down

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But today

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now, I think this was set up through DocSurles

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He got an email

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
From someone I believe it was a producer from WNYC

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Public Radio in New York

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Asking him to come on the show

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
On the Brian Lera Show

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Which is a morning radio show in New York

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Which apparently a lot of people listen to

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And talk about podcasting

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And very graciously

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Doc said, well, you should talk to Dave and Adam

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And I got to be honest that I didn't really follow all the email threads

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The email is fucking exploding out of control

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't wait to get on a 14 hour plane ride to San Francisco

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just to sort out my email

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What I'm basically doing now is I'm trying to get all the directory stuff

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
For new entries to the directory and get those in

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That has priority you know besides

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Whatever shit comes in from tax attorneys and lawyers

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That just I'm forced to look at

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
With fucking office attachments

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Excel sheets and word documents I hate him

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So, this was really amazing to be on the show

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think I was on for almost like 20 minutes

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And there were playing bits from podcast

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
From the source code, the Don and Drew show

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And just to give an impression

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And really went into detail and they really done their work

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And this producer had indeed done really done his job

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It was funny because

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And this had never happened before

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I've been lots of radio interviews in the states

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
All over the world

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And for the first time I was given like the legal disclaimer on the phone

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I have to actually ask questions

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you agree to have your voice with broadcast on radio and AM and whatever

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Do you agree that this can be archived on the internet

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For webcast and on CDs for distribution

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, so you agree it's like signing your waiver

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it was great and he

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Brian there opened up the phones for calls

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is a New York-based radio station

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And it was as if we had set it up

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But we hadn't

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And in came to me a very familiar voice

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is 93.9 and AMA 20 WNYC

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We're speaking with Adam Curry

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We developed a software that allows so-called podcasting

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Which is broadcasting or just moving audio around

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
via MP3 on the web or to your iPod

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And here is Brian in Durham, North Carolina

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Who says he's a podcast

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Brian, you want to go to your NYC?

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hi, how are you?

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
For my podcast is audioactivism.org

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey Adam, I really appreciate all you've been doing

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's really a great outlet

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
To a lot of creative people

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
All right.

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And what do you do?

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Go ahead and plug away

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Sure, my podcast

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So I was going to comment on that

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was like I was so amazed

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Here's Brian from audioactivism.org

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just been listening to his podcast

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The night before my way back

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
From Amsterdam to Belgium

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And it was like that's when he said

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hey, it's really great

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And for a split second

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
For a split second

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you can actually I'm going to read

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going to wind this

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm going to rewind this

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to say what I was thinking of saying

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
At the moment, Brian came in

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay, so you'll get the full effect

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I didn't want to do it because it's like public radio

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It was a really big deal to do this in New York

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But I'm going to kind of give you that effect

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey, it's just fine

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, we go to this part

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All right, and what do you do?

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right, okay

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All right, and what do you do?

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right, and what?

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Basically, you're saying this is so great

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Thank you Adam for this

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I really appreciate all you've been doing

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's really a good, great outlet

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
To a lot of creative people

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All right, and what do you do?

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Got it?

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sure, my podcast is basically about

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
called three or else

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And a uniform resource locator

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Basically, like web address

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That has something to do with activism online

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's another thing that blogs do really well

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a type of social software that allows people to connect

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And obviously during this sub-political season

220
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A lot of people have been using it for different types of activism

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But it's not just about president

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It takes other things as well

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But you can see the show so much political

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And that sense, and it allows me to reach

225
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You know, a huge audience, a group of people

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We're hosted by a Biblio.org

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Which is real famous for hosting all kinds of things

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Like free software, that sort of stuff

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But that's what I've been doing

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And what's amazing is I'm listening to your show

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
As a streaming in V3 with iTunes

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
On my PC at work

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I heard about this show

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
On Docs, Girls' Blog

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So the viral nature of how we hear about

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know, what's going on, what items up to

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And what different people are doing

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Is, you know, a really fantastic

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I'm talking about John Stewart there

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, that's great.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Brian, thanks a lot for calling

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And that's,

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think it's been good rather than competition

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So then the interview goes on

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I put a link up to a recording of the stream

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That Rick from WGBH

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Put up for us and he said I could point to it

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So the audio skips here and there in a couple of spots

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But you'll get a general idea

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I think this is another win for the good guys

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This was great

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And I also, since it was so much time

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You know, it was so nice to talk for such

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For such a long, it's like three segments

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And 20, 20 minutes total

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I got to talk about, you know,

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Users and developers being together

258
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Also, a lot of Dave Winner came out of my mouth

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
During that interview

260
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Particularly, you'll hear a bit about

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The blogger's fear getting closer to

262
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know, what CNN is showing on television

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So I just wanted to give credit there

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because I was listening to the interview again

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I was like, wow, you know, I sometimes

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
To open my mouth and Dave comes out

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know, that could, that could be dangerous

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Sometimes, got to watch that

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay, let me see

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff to talk about

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Still, back to the music for a second

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In my previous show

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I solicited blatantly

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
For folks to come up with a show

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And if you're willing to listen through some stuff

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And cue some MP3s up

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe you can produce something

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I've already seen it in my mail

279
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've gotten quite a few responses

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can't respond to all of them

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And I'm, you know, basically going to sit through everything

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was kind of cool to receive an audio comment

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Though from Andy Affleck

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Adam, hi, this is Andy Affleck

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Coming to you from the Washington DC area

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
In the US of A

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I'm, I'm responding to your call

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
For help, looking for a producer

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
From the latest podcast

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Almost forgot all about it

291
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because the story from your wife

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
After it was so hysterical

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sitting listening to this on

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The bus ride home from work

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Laughing my ass off

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And people in the bus are looking at me like

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I am some sort of strange person

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You can see the looks and the faces like

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Must be one of them carry people

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Anyway, which I am

301
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It must show

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's not like us, he's one of them carry people

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So anyway, I'm intrigued

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
By the notion of

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Uniting a producer

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Meaning someone sort of

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Gather up

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Scoured in that for some music

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And he also might be useful for the show

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This is an intriguing, intriguing proposition

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
For me because I have been wanting to do a podcast

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Since I first discovered this

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Sometime in early September

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think it was

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I've been listening to shows

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Since just before early September

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And

318
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You know, and trying to do it

319
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My own show

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I just can't imagine pulling it again

321
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I just can't, with a four year old kid

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Finding a place to record

323
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Alone

324
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Is almost impossible

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Right now I've got my wife corraling

326
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Another part of the house so I can do this

327
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But I

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The idea of helping out though

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
In that capacity

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Is sort of the side of it that really interests me

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think I've got interesting things to say

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But you know, I could put that on hold

333
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Or I could still do my own thing

334
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But to be able to sort of help you out

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In some of the things you're looking at

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Finding music

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Trying to come up with some new ideas

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hack, I used to be a frontier developer

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Many years ago

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Met Dave once too even

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Daddy remembers me

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But in your rate

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You'd be frontier developer

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Many years ago

345
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Did a lot of work up at Dartmouth College building

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Systems for them

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So even on the 10th bus side

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I even might be able to help out

349
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I haven't done anything in front here

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Since

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Four point something or other

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I doubt the language itself has changed all that much

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Anyway, I am

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Basically saying

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If you're interested

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm interested

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Maybe we should

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Talk and see what we can

360
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Figure out

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you got a million of the responses

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And people who've said a lot more

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's fine too

364
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Figure out give it a shot

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And that's it

366
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Signing off

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
From Northern Virginia

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Bye

369
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Isn't that amazing?

370
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean

371
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The kind of people that are out there

372
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know, interested in music

373
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Frontier developer

374
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This is great

375
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I really really dig in this

377
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I got

378
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Also received just like

379
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Andy mentioned

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I got a lot of comments about

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Patricia's

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
David Bowie's story

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Which lasted a lot longer than I expected

384
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I thoroughly enjoyed it

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We talked about that

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A couple of times

387
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yesterday

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I had a lot of fun interviewing

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You know

390
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I even got more out of

391
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The interview

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The David Bowie's story

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then I heard

394
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The first four times

395
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I squeezed it out

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I was like

397
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tell me about David Bowie

398
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Come on

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Tell me that story

400
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And

401
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And

402
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I even got some requests

403
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
People saying

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Hey

405
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Can't you give

406
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Patricia like your own

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hipy story

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Channel or something like that

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
She does have a couple more

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And she says that she enjoyed

411
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
herself

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And that she's looking forward to

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Another episode

414
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We got to go

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Careflon

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I can't stretch it too much

417
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You know otherwise

418
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She'll get out

419
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know she'll be onto us

420
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They'll really dig in this too much

421
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So

422
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And you know

423
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Don't you'll make me a slave

424
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Even more so than I am already

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So

426
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We'll get more hippy stories

427
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I promise you that

428
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hit in the email here for a second

429
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Some came in from Toaster

430
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Toaster says

431
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's been enjoying

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Daily source code

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And kind of made a mix

434
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You know a lot of these bush mixes

435
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That I've played

436
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, he kind of made a mix

437
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
From the source code

438
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Along those along that vein

439
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And he mentioned something

440
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That we definitely have to talk about

441
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I do want to

442
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Just say that we lost a great

443
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He's a broadcaster

444
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But he totally was a podcaster

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
John Peel

446
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
British DJ

447
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Who I used

448
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They used to air him over in the Netherlands

449
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I mean he has to show what's

450
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Indicated across country lines

451
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I mean this guy was big in Europe

452
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He used to die very young

453
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
65 to years old

454
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Of a heart attack

455
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He was in Lima, Peru

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know what he was doing there

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And Toaster was also obviously a big fan

458
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Said you know

459
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Can you play the mighty wall

460
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Or the Smiths

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Unfortunately you know

462
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Can't do that

463
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because we're trying to stay away

464
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
From many problems with the RIAA

465
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Which sucks you know

466
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because I know what he's talking about

467
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
With these songs

468
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And those are memories

469
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You know it's important stuff

470
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So unfortunately I can't do that

471
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But I do want to play your mix

472
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because it's really really good

473
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Back in La Blom Blom

474
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No one's buying anything

475
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Two weeks ago on the highway

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Hard in the side holster

477
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
La Blom

478
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
La Blom

479
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Be perfect right here

480
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hold me right caught up

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
La Blom

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No one's buying anything

483
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Two weeks ago on the highway

484
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hard in the side holster

485
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
La Blom

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
La Blom

487
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Be perfect right here

488
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hold me right caught up

489
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
La Blom

490
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
La Blom

491
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
La Blom

492
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
La Blom

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
She doesn't want my wand

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
La Blom

495
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
La Blom

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I hate it

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No one's buying anything

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They must have had their ears on

499
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They're blind

500
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
They're blind

501
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're blind

502
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They're blind

503
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They're blind

504
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Look at what people are doing

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What links for women to go

506
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I hope you hear us

507
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Back in La Blom

508
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
La Blom

509
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The next side holster

510
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
La Blom

511
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No one's buying anything

512
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Now shut me down

513
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Look what's going on

514
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
La Blom

515
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Flame

516
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,020
Bring back much of it

517
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,920
Desperate

518
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Black Ferrari's Good Thoughts

519
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And prayers

520
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
See you tomorrow

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Ohhh

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Eat all the heat off

523
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Great Energy Boost

524
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a full-surdest planet.

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a full-surdest planet.

526
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's a full-surdest planet.

527
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's a full-surdest planet.

528
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A lot of energy.

529
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's a full-surdest planet.

530
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And it's a full-surdest planet.

531
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,760
love that. And I tell you that at the end of the day, a buddy of mine came over, friend of

532
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,480
mine came over. We had some dinner. Well, that means we're like, we're not got some pizza

533
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,560
came back and hung out here. And we're just talking about, you know, life and stuff and

534
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:20,280
getting older and smoke the couple joints. And then listen to this mix. It's very, very

535
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:27,840
cool. Ray, thank you very much. Looking forward to coming over your way. And who knows? I'm

536
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,160
sorry, toaster. Ray is from London. That's who I was going to talk about. Oh, man. See,

537
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,520
smoke too much. All right. Let's get it straight here. This was a, yeah, this is about the

538
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,200
director. He said, this is about OPML. We've been talking about this and Ray, who's

539
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,680
going to welcome me from London and look forward to becoming. Has some some interesting

540
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,520
comments and suggestions about XML, RSS, and particularly OPML and our iPodder.org

541
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,640
directory. Hey, Adam. This is Ray Boison here, recording from London and the UK. Looking

542
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,480
forward to having you here. Oh, how do I know that? It's going to be an interesting

543
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,920
experience for you. I have a suggestion for the podcast directly though. I'm the editor

544
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,520
of the technology directly. And I've noticed a lot of people are having some problems with

545
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:21,320
the XML OPML, ML files that they send me as links. A large percentage of them are not valid

546
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,160
in XML terms. I spend most of my iPodder time dedicated to helping the users getting

547
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,080
the XML files to validate properly. My suggestion would be a link on Apple.org that allows

548
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,480
the podcast to validate his or her's feed file. I'm not sure how to support it, but maybe

549
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,720
we could get Dave Warren involved to help out. Well, that's all from cold London. No, enjoy

550
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,840
the rest of your day. Oh, man, cold London. Thanks. That makes me feel real good. We're

551
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,480
moving in less than it was like three weeks now. So I am living in the midst of boxes

552
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:58,200
of my friends. I'm pretty sure that there are some validators that I don't want to, you

553
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,360
know, point to them without knowing if that's okay. So I know that Dave's going to hear

554
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,440
this and he's going to probably point me to a tutorial and a validator. I know there's

555
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,880
an RSS validator. There's a couple of them. And there's probably an OPML validator. There

556
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,440
should be. So that's that is good because I agree. I also spend a lot of my time helping out

557
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,360
folks who want to maintain nodes within a directory. And if you go to iPod.org and if you're

558
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,440
new to the podcast, this is a distributed directory. So no one owns it. No one's the boss of me.

559
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,520
Anyone can contribute, maintain a node. You can add sub-nodes to that. And it's completely

560
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,200
distributed across the web. And if you think that you want to start your top node, then you can

561
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,480
do that. What's cool about this now is that it's also flowing into the new iPod or software.

562
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:54,840
iPod or X. I'm using currently a beta version which is importing the entire directory. It's

563
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,520
actually following all the links and crawling it and parsing it and bringing it information.

564
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,840
And they are doing some really cool stuff. Stuff we've done in the weblog world, which is going

565
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:14,040
to give us more information about what's happening in the podcast. God, I want to say it space.

566
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,400
Okay, in the podcast world, let's leave it at that. And also I got a screenshot from Andrew

567
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:30,520
from the iPod or Lemon Edition team. And they're also incorporating the directory into their

568
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:37,320
next release. So exciting stuff coming up on all things iPod. Check out iPod.org if you don't

569
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,600
already, if you're not already using the software or just for the latest updates podcast. And of course

570
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:49,800
for the podcast directory. And now something about MP3 voice mail to email. Adam, thank you for

571
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,400
dare I say inventing podcasting. Oh boy, I love the daily source code. And boy, almost cut up on all

572
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,920
your podcast. Great stuff, very informative, very entertaining. A few podcasts back you mentioned,

573
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,800
it is IR for receiving MP3s in your email. I don't quite have that set up, but I have been using

574
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,840
J2.com's free fax voice mail email service. Basically, you get a US phone number that accepts voice

575
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,240
emails and faxes and then emails into you. The voice emails are limited to five minutes and the

576
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,880
quality is low, but it isn't too bad for a quick update or an observation. I use the voice mail

577
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,560
box to send myself quick reminders when I'm driving. The voice mail attachments come as GSM files.

578
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,920
And on my Mac, they play right in the mail program using QuickTime. They also play on Windows

579
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,320
with QuickTime. I think the service could be a pretty cool way to call in short podcast, like

580
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,320
maybe from a trade show. You can have the voice mail as forward to Danny Box, so I can imagine

581
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,720
a mailbox script that takes the attachments, converts them to MP3 and then posted to your blog.

582
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,960
I don't have the skills to make this happen, but perhaps with your vast daily source code

583
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,120
influence, you could encourage one or two of your listeners to look for a solution.

584
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,440
Another way you might benefit from these MP3 voice emails or GSM voice emails would be for

585
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,720
listener calling people going to call into the number, leave a voice mail and you can play

586
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,840
it back to your show. Since it's free pretty much anyone who's podcasting can probably afford

587
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,320
to now have a call in number for their podcast show. I'm really liking that idea, and I think I

588
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,360
had a J2 account, but when it was still called J fax, I don't know, and I actually had a local

589
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,520
Amsterdam number, and something happened in one away. I remember the problem is that they only

590
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,560
would send wave files. They wouldn't make MP3s, and they got pretty big, and I should definitely

591
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,560
look into that. I wish I had God, I can't really say this. I wish I had the Windows version of Skype,

592
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,960
or at least the Windows functionality, because you can get this cool voice mail program to add on,

593
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,080
and apparently it records voice mail when people Skype you. That would be really cool, you know,

594
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,640
to kind of route around the whole telephone company dance there, but also a call number would be

595
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,440
cool, but, you know, kind of think of it. Is that what I really need, you know, more things to

596
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,200
check, more voice mail boxes, more email boxes, I'm really drowning here folks. Let me see,

597
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:18,280
looking at the YEP external recorder, we are 20, what are we 28 minutes into this? I don't want

598
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,320
to make it longer than 40 minutes. I do like that as a length for a show. So what I was going

599
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,800
to do, I was going to review two parts of the Apple iPod presentation. I also want to play

600
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,280
another song from the wire to the, okay, I'm going to drop the second part of the Apple iPod

601
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,960
presentation, which is just you too. And I'll just, I'll sum up you two's appearance, presenting

602
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,280
the new YouTube iPod with what my daughter Christina said, who was 14, and she's a punk rocker,

603
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:53,400
and she said, you know, did you two ever not like suck? What do you mean? They're pretentious

604
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,800
and they are, and they're cell outs and go look at it on Apple's website, you can look at

605
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,320
the presentation, you know, and it's just sickening, man. See these guys, like pretend like this,

606
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,280
oh, you know, Steve Jobs is saving the music industry. This is the future of, you know,

607
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,160
iTunes music store is it, but meanwhile they're saying, you know, as long as we get paid, literally

608
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,240
the edge is saying, hey, as long as we get, you know, I love Napster, and I love it, as long as we get paid,

609
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,520
it just wasn't all, it was all the wrong things to say. It really was. Anyway, I was very disappointed

610
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,640
by the presentation of the new iPod. I know I'm a fan, you know, I got an iPod. I'm a Mac fan,

611
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm an Apple fan. I love Steve Jobs's presentations. I love the way he does him. He's much thinner

612
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,160
by the way, of course, he's been sick, he was operated on for cancer, and it was, it wasn't taken

613
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,920
in back, I was like, whoa, man, he really got a lot thinner, and he looked, he just looked a little

614
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,520
more frail, you know, which is totally understandable, of course, but if you haven't seen him,

615
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:58,600
just trying to give you an image. And so he goes through blah, blah, blah, on some socks, you know,

616
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,080
we have socks for your iPod for 25 bucks for three socks, fuck that, colored socks, I'm not kidding.

617
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,960
And then, you know, the big moment, it's time to look at what's next.

618
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,560
It was a nice stage. It was a nice stage. With iPod.

619
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:26,920
All right, so that was the socks, the joke about socks. We get asked a lot. What's, what's podcasting?

620
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,240
Next. Oh, what's next? You know, what's next? For the iPod. You know,

621
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,600
at this moment, I'm going, oh man, I hope he says there's some people out there on the internet,

622
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,680
and I hear their podcast then. No such luck. Everybody loves music, and iPod will always be

623
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:54,280
a music device. Whoa, this is where I started to get worried. It will always be a music device, okay.

624
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:00,280
It's about listening to music, but you see what I'm saying? We've got this great device. It's got

625
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:06,440
a screen. It's got this amazing user interface with the click wheel. What else can we do with it?

626
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,720
What else can we add to the music? And our competitors are saying,

627
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,520
oh, shit. That's Dave. It's answer to the phone. You're on the source code. Good afternoon.

628
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm curious. Hey, Dave. You know what? Let me see in the next episode. No, I'm, I'm, you're on the source

629
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,240
code right now. You have breaking news. You read the Times article?

630
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:39,320
Better with everything. It is a K-A-S article. Yeah, a podcasting is defined and accepted. It doesn't

631
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,840
even appear as its name. What are those? This is our previous review. Well, hold on Dave. Hold on

632
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,760
home. You're breaking up. I want to be able to hear you. Come again on that last bit?

633
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,240
It, they used the word podcasting like it was in the English language. Really?

634
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,800
Yes. It's not a little piece. It's a, it's a welcome to the wonderful world in it. I piece of

635
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:14,280
for the New York Times. It's, you know, they've been very sort of unwilling to accept. I mean,

636
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,560
yes. They really defined the camera. They play up Don and Drew. Hold on Dave. I'm going to call

637
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,320
you back because I want to hear this and it's just shitty. I know if I call you back a little bit of

638
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,680
two seconds. God damn. So this is Dave calling in with the New York Times article that we've all been

639
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:39,000
waiting for. Let's see if we get a little better connection. Yeah, I'm much better. Okay. Okay. So

640
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:53,400
sorry. Yeah. Yeah. It has a picture of, um, um, uh, the net rock skies. Oh, really? Yeah. And it has some

641
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,960
really great quotes for you. Um, it's just all around. We'll be able to ask these. And

642
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,680
the nice thing about it is sort of like what, what is really not even said is that they just use

643
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:14,600
the word podcast. Let's throw a word. Excellent. And, you know, the head of mine is, um, I mean,

644
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,960
we, you know, it's to have all of this stuff feel, you forget how, I'll get, if they, I'll get it.

645
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,600
But they say, you do food for our, uh, honest, on it, I subscription. So, you know, it's like,

646
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:35,080
I'm, uh, it's food for your iPod. Absolutely. Right, but which, you know, who's feeling your

647
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:42,440
iPod? Yeah, you know, uh, you know, so it's, it's a very, very, very adorable way, um, uh, I think we'll

648
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,000
look back on this moment. Yeah, you know, it's, you know, it's a very, really important just to

649
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,560
be different from the way that they handle. Well, I think it was, you know, now that I'm on the

650
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,600
head, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's best. Uh, most of the time that we'd say there's no business

651
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,680
model on the, or it's just like, to be radiates the fan. Right. Yeah, exactly. It's the hype of the day.

652
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,520
This is not like that at all. This is not, I got it right. And I think that, uh, you, you're,

653
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:16,120
like, you, to close the piece. Your quote is that, um, so we, you say, we, it is a nice,

654
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,840
you can receive, I guess, with, uh, be it to any, and that's the thing here's to administer.

655
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,320
Well, I wish I could have understood that. I hope, I hope no one who reads that article

656
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,960
listens to this podcast. The, uh, because, you know, you, yeah, they don't see, as he took the

657
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,640
off his body. Oh, that's too bad. They didn't do any fact checking there at the New York Times.

658
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,560
Actually, actually, this was written by, uh, Sirus, uh, was his name Dave Fabiar?

659
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,560
Caramel, are you? Caramel, are you? Caramel, are you? And he, you know,

660
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,320
I have to say that he emailed me about five or six times after, uh, we spoke on the, we actually

661
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:04,680
spoke on a Skype call, and he checked a whole bunch of facts. Yeah. He, he was very, very thorough.

662
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,040
And I think he's a freelance writer. I think this might have been his first big piece for,

663
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:14,120
is it, I mean, how many words is it? It's not one piece. And, um, I don't know how many words it is,

664
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:21,320
maybe 1000 words. But, um, it's a great piece for podcast. And it's, uh, it's a, it's a piece

665
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:30,840
for RSS, by the way. I mean, it's, it might be the first article that's part of RSS for a long time.

666
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,280
They've been supporting it. But it was, it was really nice about it. It was an interview with, um,

667
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,000
big K, and the variety of tick conversations. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, this is that, you know,

668
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,680
the reason why we'd use three users. Yeah. And so it's not, you know, we don't focus to be on

669
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,400
the, you know, or the wiring in the plug and stuff like that. We want to do this with some of

670
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,760
what people are doing with it. And that's that. We just want users and developers to party together.

671
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,680
Yeah. But, you know, when it comes time to the story is users, the developers,

672
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,480
perfades in the background, the developer, he can get possible for the users to put on a

673
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,440
don't on true show, you know. Yeah. Absolutely. There's a, yeah.

674
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,600
Cool. Now, if you pointed to this from scripting news,

675
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,400
bottom of scripting news, and I'll still, but then I bought it. Or two excellent. Excellent.

676
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,840
Yeah. Yeah. This is good. This is a validation of the ice piece and, you know, thanks

677
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
here at your time. Really. Yeah. Well, thanks everybody, because everyone's been a part of this.

678
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:40,040
This has been great. Thanks everybody. Thanks, everyone. All right, Dave, I'll, I'll check

679
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:48,200
you later, man. I'm going to play some tunes. Thanks to the news, buddy. Hi. Sorry about the

680
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,200
quality there of Skype, but I don't know why I decided to sound like shit. It doesn't matter.

681
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

682
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Yeah.

683
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Yeah.

684
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Yeah.

686
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

687
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The Kors foralec. Yeah. Mmm, yeah. Yeah. I don't know what influenced me. Yeah? ese yeah. Yeah. That's the hardest I can know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Happy in the show. They got one but they like you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah, it's actually this Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do better for me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

688
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,960
This is a good day, and there's some other important things in there that I'm happy

689
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
to see.

690
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,720
I'm seeing recognition as Mr. Winner of the inventor of RSS. It is indeed nice that the

691
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
New York Times is writing that.

692
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,600
Okay, let's, you know, it's 40 minutes, a little bit longer into this, what are we now?

693
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,960
This is a very small display, 41 minutes.

694
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:23,800
Okay, can't do a show without something nutty from Pete, from Raster Web Audio.

695
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,000
He's so into this podcasting thing, and this is the latest episode of Crack Me Up.

696
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,280
Hope you don't mind if I play it in its entirety.

697
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,760
This is Draster Web Audio, 4024, and 26.

698
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,800
What we're going to do here is, you know, I'm preparing for the data to slash dot, add some sort

699
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,640
audio commentary thing where you can provide your comments in audio.

700
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,480
So I thought in preparation for that, I kind of do some of the more popular ones, the

701
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,720
ones you're going to see anyway, so that way they'll be done, you won't need to do them.

702
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
So here we go.

703
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,200
Yeah, but does it run Linux?

704
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,240
Natalie Bartman, imagine a bail wolf cluster of those things.

705
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,480
Microsoft sucks, but it's not open source.

706
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,600
Did you even read the article?

707
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
This isn't new.

708
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,200
I've been doing this for 10 years.

709
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,000
Cowboy Neil, BSD sucks.

710
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,640
First post, BSD is better than Linux.

711
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,440
I have poured hot grits down my pants.

712
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Thank you.

713
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,000
The site is already slashed at it.

714
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,120
Apple sucks.

715
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
That's it.

716
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Thank you for tonight.

717
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
I love you.

718
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
That was awesome.

719
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,120
I was cracking up here in that for the third time now, fabulous.

720
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
All right, everybody.

721
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,120
And that's going to do it for the source code for today.

722
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,120
I will do the Apple stuff another time.

723
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Yeah, I want to be positive.

724
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,680
Now that we've got some good, good energy flow in the New York Times article, I was going

725
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,360
to say in the closet about the iPod presentation, and I know Steve Jobs is going to read

726
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
New York Times.

727
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,360
He's going to read this and he's going to hear about our podcast and maybe he'll

728
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,880
start singing.

729
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,600
And again, maybe he will.

730
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
This yet is still pretty attractive.

731
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,080
But I think that brush metal look would have been more of a brush.

732
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
There.

733
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
Look at my good.

734
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
A metal tampon.

735
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Two strings coming out.

736
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,040
One for head four, one for the line out jack.

737
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,760
And I'll be back tomorrow.

738
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,040
I'm going to hospital my mom.

739
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
So it'll probably be there.

740
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,680
I like post on the show, but I'll have some music out there.

741
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,760
And thank you very much for tuning in.

742
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
And take care.

743
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,280
