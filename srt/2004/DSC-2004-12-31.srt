00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
This hit shut out of your Texas Ranger's final score last night and I'm really screwed on

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
635 OVJ.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,760
It's Adam Curry.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,440
It is the last day of the year.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,640
Hey everybody, welcome to the source code 4.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:34,600
Friday, December 31st, 2004, the last day of 2004 and the last cast for the year with the same number

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
2004.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
There we go.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
All right.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Lots to do with the source code today.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,480
I mean, lots of power, lots of power, lots of power, lots of power, lots of power.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,160
Man, actually, it's probably too much and I just want to get all the stuff out.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,600
You don't want to keep anything more to start fresh in the new year with a new podcast.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
There we got all going on.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,800
Wait a minute, you know, there's absolutely no podcast that can start without a little

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
bit of drum cadence.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry for the abrupt rock mine off break off there, but we just got a kick some cadence.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,920
Hit hit, yeah, I'm telling you that this is one of my presolutions for the new year.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,360
I got to start a cadence cast.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,480
It's just too many people who are so totally innocent.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,280
God, I love that.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Hi Adam.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,200
This is The Noir Man from TheNoirMan.com.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,720
I just wanted to say hi.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,480
I love the show.

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,280
And I've noticed that you're on this drum cadence kick.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
No, you don't say it lately.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,080
So I wanted to share a little something with you.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,520
As it happens, yours truly was a snare drum or back in school.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,160
I happened to have some old tapes of my line doing stuff.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,400
So this is an MP3 of my drum line, the Yuma High School marching criminals.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
That's right.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,160
My high school mascot was a criminal.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,280
And this is us circa 1994, I think.

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,040
I believe this was the fall of 1994.

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,200
And I hope you enjoy it.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,040
And once again, I love the show, best wishes to you and everyone in your life for a prosperous

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
new year.

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Right out.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
And keep up the good work.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,080
Unfortunately, it's not one of the better recordings.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,040
But of course, it is nine years old.

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,040
The criminals.

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,160
Yeah, we need to, I'm telling you, I'm going to do a cadence cast in the new year.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
It just has to happen.

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm receiving so many different drum cadences from people.

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
Let me see, I think I have what I had the blue doubles here.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,040
I mean, I don't even have enough time in the source code to play all of this stuff.

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,800
Check this one out, this is pretty good, too.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,880
This is from 1986, the new devils taking first place.

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,360
All of these, of course, are appropriately linked in the podcast production show notes.

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,920
Also got an email from Dorothy from Westalay, or is it Dorothy West?

53
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,240
No, no, it's Dorothy from Westalay.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,880
She says that this cadence stuff sounds a lot like tyco drumming.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,320
And now, of course, I can't find the tyco drumming bit that I had queued up.

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm almost over here somewhere.

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Shoot, I'll have to find this.

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,360
Lots of emails, lots of different cadences all in the production show notes for today's source code.

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,480
It's really, it's amazing how many people are into this.

60
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,200
This is a big community.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm just looking for more hits.

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Looking for more hits done by really swinging bands.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
It doesn't just have to be drums.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,120
It can be, it can be with other, the fact, preferably with other instruments.

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
So, in today's source code, we have a lot of stuff to talk about.

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,960
In fact, I'm already going to skip right over the first two or the second and third items that I had queued up for today's show, because I know we're not going to be able to get to them.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:12,240
It's 330 in the afternoon on the last day of 2004 here at the Curry Cottage in Lovely Gilford in the UK.

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,840
So this morning, I knew that I had to, or that I was going to go out with Patricia, I'm going to do lots of grocery shopping, get all kinds of stuff for tonight.

69
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,560
Of course, it's the three of us and then Christina's friend Isha, who was visiting from Holland.

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,320
She's British and she goes to the British school and that's where they met in Amsterdam.

71
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,040
She's been friends for a couple of years, so she's celebrating with us.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,720
So we got all the food and stuff to burn in the fireplace, which of course can't be wood, right?

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,360
No, no, no.

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,680
Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to burn wood in this fireplace here.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,400
It's just, the room is a little bit too small, so I have to resort to duraflame fire logs.

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:57,560
I know, it's not very manly, no chopping of wood, no splitting stuff, and no tough time lighting it.

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,880
This is just, you know, extend the two ends of paper, which light and go.

78
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,800
So I said to Patricia, I said, you know, yesterday, I actually tried to find a different spot than Starbucks to go,

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,360
you know, to get some connectivity, and I know that there are several other Wi-Fi providers,

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:24,040
just not necessarily with a, you know, a caffeination bar and baristas, standing by for my every back and call.

81
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,880
And it wasn't too successful, actually yesterday.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:35,000
I also had a kind of a date with Lloyd, if you saw the weblog yesterday, he dropped by just to say hi.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,240
So yeah, I kind of want to hook up with him, didn't want to, you know, just blow him off.

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,600
I was looking at other places to go, and I said, well, you know, what I'm going to do this morning is I'm going to load up the car.

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,120
I get my 12 volt adapter, so that it adapts to 110 volts right into the laptop.

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,200
I got everything else set, laptop on the front seat, got my I Stomler software running, which basically it scans,

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,720
frequencies to find Wi-Fi, and then it'll tell you if it's an open Wi-Fi or if it's closed.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Actually, I can't get it to, to make a sound when it finds something.

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,960
I thought that there was a way to make go blip or blowing or boiling, boiling would be appropriate, of course.

90
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,120
So I kind of magnified the screen, it's really easy on a Mac on OSX, there's a way you can zoom in on the screen.

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,560
So I zoomed in on the application itself, made it really big, so I knew that when I was driving out of the corner of my eye,

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,280
if it caught a Wi-Fi link, I'd see that happen, and I'd know to, you know, stop, we're trying to figure out if that was something that I could tap into.

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,440
So back out of the driveway, roll down like 15 yards and blink, there it is, I see it, this fucking net gear pops up on my screen,

94
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:48,880
which was not there before, the last time I checked was about four weeks ago, and it's an open Wi-Fi access point, and one of my neighbors has,

95
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,880
and I'm not quite sure which one, I try to locate it, it's, it must be bouncing off something because I can't really say,

96
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,200
okay, it's this house sorts that house, and it wasn't there before I know, because I checked the neighborhood quite thoroughly with

97
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:09,440
the same setup. So here's my theory, because I found that the previous people who were renting this home,

98
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,760
when they left, and they did something which wasn't really nice, although, perhaps understandable,

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:21,360
they basically transferred every single service and utility to their new house, and the real estate agent has no idea.

100
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,200
What's, I mean, the real estate agent actually told me there was already broadband in this house,

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,840
and we moved in and it turned out there wasn't. So here's my theory, I think this is what happened,

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,480
because also gas electricity, you know, the provider was contacted by the Revestate agent,

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,480
you know, who takes care of all the rental stuff, and they sent me a letter saying, sorry,

104
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,400
you know, we'd love to put it in your name, but you have a different provider, and we don't know who's

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,640
not going to find out who is sending, who is giving me electricity and gas, and how can I pay for it,

106
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:01,280
because if I don't pay for it, eventually it will turn off. So I think that the previous

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,640
tenant transferred everything, including broadband, which means that one of my neighbors was

108
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,240
probably on the on the waiting list, popped to the top of the queue, just as I was supposed to get

109
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,040
that port from British telecom, and probably they got my port, something like that, I guess,

110
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,280
doesn't make that much difference, because at this point, well, there's only three more days

111
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:34,560
until the fine folks that had easy net come into install my four megabit link. Of course,

112
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,240
I won't be here, so I'm working with Christina to instruct her exactly where it's supposed to go,

113
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,000
what's supposed to happen, and hopefully even get her up on the broadband while I'm in the states,

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,560
because I'll be gone until the 10th or the 11th. I think I come back on the 11th. So it's going to be

115
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:58,240
it's kind of like the stewardess landing the 747 with controls coming from

116
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,280
air traffic control on the ground. We'll see how it goes. She's pretty smart kid, she can figure

117
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,120
a lot of this stuff out. So anyway, so I found a spot right outside the door. Now, it doesn't,

118
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,560
I tried to to receive the same signal from inside. I walked around the whole neighborhood, it's almost

119
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,440
impossible to figure out who's it is. I know who's it isn't, because a couple of neighbors,

120
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,160
drove by or were getting ready walking into their house and I said, hey, I'm picking up a Wi-Fi,

121
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,320
is it yours? No, not mine. So I'm trying to figure it. Anyway, I'm happy it's there, and I will be using

122
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,360
it right after I finish this source code. I'll drive my car 15 feet into the road and I'm

123
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,040
be uploading from the A8 Studio. Think about it. I almost have a mobile studio that is, well,

124
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,200
that's completely mobile and has the Wi-Fi ready to roll as well. So anyway, so

125
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,720
after that, we went shopping and I took some time to buy a couple of newspapers, big newspaper

126
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,000
country here. Not what I'm used to at all compared to the Netherlands. There's so many papers,

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,680
tabloids, broad cheats, different types of information. But all the pictures, and of course, I've

128
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,880
seen most of these pictures on web logs, which is really, I think, web logs once again, or once

129
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,920
disaster strikes, web logs eventually bring you the best news, or the most complete news,

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,240
let's put it that way, because none of the news is really good at all. And I'm sure this has

131
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,680
happened to you. It happened to me this morning again when you look at these pictures, a picture,

132
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:39,280
which takes up the front page of the newspaper and you say, well, it's like all this rubbish in

133
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,000
the water. What is that? Is that crops? Until you look at the picture and I'm sure that this

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,400
happened to you, you say, oh, God, it's people. Thousands of people. It's very hard to be, it's very hard

135
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,200
to be upbeat, happy, it's very hard to understand. It hasn't quite hit the two girls who are here

136
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
Christina and her friend. They haven't really been exposed too much to it, I guess. They haven't

137
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,840
been watching that much television. But I know that the questions are going to come and I know

138
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:21,920
that it's going to be hard for them to fathom it. Once they truly understand what kind of devastation

139
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:30,080
this has been, what are we up to now? 125,000 on the death toll. So as I played that bit yesterday

140
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,120
from the CIDI, the best thing you can do is give cash. I'm giving cash left and right wherever I can,

141
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm seeking out organizations. I figure if I give cash to several different organizations,

142
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,560
it'll help in different ways. At the shopping center, there's people outside, collecting money,

143
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,400
red cross, and in our own communities, of course, this is happening as well. I've got an email

144
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,080
from August. August is a part of the iPodorex team. He and Ray were talking about the horror

145
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,720
of course in Indian and Asia. What they're doing is, since they say that this point, they're probably

146
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,960
the only podcasting iPodore client that charges money for the full version, they're going to donate

147
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:21,200
all income of iPodorex's sale for the next days. Let's see, through January 8th for the next week

148
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,440
to the disaster relief. So when you buy iPodorex, use the word help in the coupon code

149
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:37,280

150
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,600
iPodore client as well, which was also nice, by the way, when I was outside in front of the

151
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,880
Audi, I did an iPodore scan. It was great. It's just so nice that just have stuff come through.

152
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:59,120
I put out a call to the godcasters, podcasters listed under the religion node in the iPodore.org

153
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:08,960
directory. Because, you know, it's this god, is this mother earth, is this nature? What is it?

154
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,360
You know, I have questions, and I put some stuff out there. And what I'd like to do now is I'd

155
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,840
like to play a bit of this podcast, which is it's very new. It's brand new. I really like the podcast

156
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,360
for a number of different reasons. Production value extremely high. I'll stop it midway as we get into

157
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,560
this podcasters answer to my questions about the disaster. Please welcome to the podcast community,

158
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:44,320
Reverend Tim. Incoming subs-based. We have Tim, podcasters.

159
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,800
We're not giving them applause. What do I look like to hear?

160
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,840
We have Tim. She don't move much, but she makes one heck of a scarecrow.

161
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Okay. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Here we are again. This is Rev Tim, and it's great to be here

162
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,240
with you today. By the way, Rev Tim got some reverb and cowbell happening there. Greetings.

163
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,400
And welcome to the whole world. And this podcast is all about bringing hope to people around the

164
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,600
world and just kind of inspire you. So at this point Patricia was listening and says,

165
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,320
he's got kind of a sexy voice. It's kind of the message of God to your life in a

166
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,920
bringer. And at this point she said, I'm getting like a thornbirds kind of vibe from Rev Tim.

167
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:50,880
Look on life to you. I'm a pastor in the San Francisco Bay area and actually really I'm more of a friend

168
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,760
to a lot of people. And I get to speak open to their lives very often.

169
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,360
Now if you want to show notes, you can just point your browser over to podcast.rev.com,

170
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,920
podcast.rev.com or if you want to contact me by email, just go ahead and send podcast at

171
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,840
revtim.com. And that's how you can get a hold of me. You know, I wanted to come to you today and just

172
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:27,520
kind of talk a little bit about the tragedy of the tsunami that hits the Asian area.

173
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,200
And we were challenged yesterday. The Godcast community was actually challenged yesterday

174
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:46,880
by Adam Curry and he was kind of wondering out loud what could have caused all this or

175
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,720
or kind of his there are bigger picture involved. And let me just play a little clip from his

176
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,360
his podcast that happened yesterday. And I think you can get a little bit of an idea of what I'm

177
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,520
talking about with that. So check out what Adam Curry had to say and then I'm going to give you some

178
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,080
response to that. Who's God did that? That's what I'd like. I'd like George Bush to stand up and say,

179
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,520
this was not our God who did this. I'd like Osama bin Laden to stand up and say, this is not our God

180
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,960
did this. I'd like the Buddhist to stand up and say, this is not our God or maybe some God will take

181
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,120
responsibility for it. Please. And the Godcasters, which you know, I have great respect for the

182
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
Godcasters, podcasters who are doing religious podcasts. We have quite quite a bit of them in the

183
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,480
iPodot org directory. Where's the explanations? Where's Reverend Tim and tell me why? Why, why, why?

184
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,880
I'd like to know why here. If there ever was a time for religion, how cool is that? We're talking

185
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,400
to each other long distance, revenue to make a statement. Good or bad, this is the time.

186
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,400
This is the time. I wonder if that's going to happen. So you can see, I was really amazed because I just

187
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:04,160
had one podcast so far. This is only my second one. And I appreciate Adam talking and bringing that

188
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,640
up because I think that is a question that a lot of people have around the world. One thing that I

189
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,240
know is when you are trying to find out things about life that I know that God has a plan and

190
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:27,200
a purpose for everyone. And the thing that I have is as far as a life's birth as it's in the Bible

191
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,480
in Jeremiah 29 and 11 where it says, I know the plans that I have for you. They are plans for good

192
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,960
and not disaster to give you a future and a hope. And I think that's something that really kind of

193
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,560
drives us long-term and a philosophy through our life and gives us strength through the difficult times.

194
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,840
So what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to take 12 minutes out of your day and check out the

195
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,040
Revitim podcast. It's only about 12 minutes. You know I love the shorter podcast. And actually,

196
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,600
I'm a fan of Revitim, whether we agree or see either I or not. And my feeling after,

197
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,680
um, hold on. Hello. This is the man who rocks my boat. Yes, this is, in fact, I don't know. It's

198
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:14,640
both men because I, I just played Revitim the Revitim. I want you to talk about Revitim.

199
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,360
Talk about, no, no, I have to go because the shops are closing. But we just went shopping. We just came back.

200
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,800
I mean, for Christina, she wants pick up a shoes. I'm just so people know I'm not lining.

201
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
What did, what did I, what did you say about Revitim?

202
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,680
That he sounded very sexy. Thank you. Good.

203
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,040
That's right. He's married. Yes, he is. Yes, of course. Of course. Okay. Are you taking the car?

204
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,160
Are you taking a good news? And we're safe. Are you taking the car?

205
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,120
Cab? Okay. Okay.

206
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,880
Okay. This is probably the email close at four. Yeah. I think so.

207
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,320
Love you. Bye. Of course, Christina needed one final pair of something to end the year.

208
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
Hold on, to end the entire year.

209
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,040
Reventim. Okay. Anyway, I like your podcast, dude. It's good. It's very inspiring. We will not agree

210
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:17,040
on a lot of things. But what I like about Reventim, the Revitim podcast, is it inspiring? He's got

211
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,080
great production values. He has a great voice. I love the reverb. Need more cowbell. But the

212
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,040
reverb is good. And he's playing bits. He's playing clips. Very, very modern. I'm totally

213
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,880
digging it. And you're inspiring, dude. It's a good podcast. You can find it under the

214
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,080
religion node on iPod.org, which by the way is now being maintained by our buddy Rick from ICM

215
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,120
Raw, the independent Christian music podcast. And he's got it all split up now with different

216
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,920
religions. And so the node is really expanded into its own little mini tree. So check it out if you

217
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,040
want. I like it. You know, I actually, not a lot of people know, but I am a reverend. I am the reverend

218
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:14,480
curry. I became, I was ordained in politics. I'm going to say 1989 or 1990. And I have performed,

219
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,840
I basically to perform wedding ceremonies. It was one of those wacky DJ things, you know,

220
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,720
where on Valentine's Day I married 70 couples in Austin. But I was pretty serious about it. And

221
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,480
I have done some, I've performed some weddings for friends and another family and other people I know

222
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,880
and some really weird mixed marriages where they couldn't figure out who should do the service.

223
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,200
And I've always kind of enjoyed doing it. Because I take it seriously when two people

224
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,920
want to be together. And I'm not necessarily proponent of marriage. You can live together or

225
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,640
be you want. You know, just if you want to have a different kind of ceremony. I was your guy. I'm retired

226
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,240
now. And thank you, Rev Tim, for responding. He goes into in a whole bunch of detail. But with most

227
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
of the, the God castes, I've found that there's no real concise answer. And I don't think it's fair

228
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:13,680
to expect that from, from anyone. But they do refer to multiple passages in Scripture. And it's

229
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,320
always interesting to hear what people have to say. So talk about Rick, who is now maintaining the

230
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,320
religion node. I've been sitting on something that he sent me. He started sending me a couple of

231
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,880
recordings that he did with Rick Daringer. Rick Daringer, you probably know from Rock

232
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:36,880
and Roll Huchiku, probably one of his biggest hits. So Rick Wesowitz, he recorded a couple of

233
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,760
live sessions with Rick Daringer. I have one here live at Cheney Hall, actually have two songs.

234
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,720
And he sent me a version of Hang On Slopey, which of course he sent after I played that drum

235
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,920
cadence, the incredibly white drum cadence of Hang On Slopey. And, you know, immediately I said,

236
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,040
dude, can I play this on the source code? And he said, well hold on a second, you know, it's

237
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,880
it's iTunes safe for now. So put it in your iTunes. And he got in touch with Rick Daringer and Rick said,

238
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,880
yeah, hell, play it on a damn source code. Go for it. Hang On Slopey. So that's exactly what we're going to do.

239
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey

240
00:22:50,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Won Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On, Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On, Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang on, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang On Slopey, hang on Slopey, hang

241
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Hang on, slew that slew that slew that high out.

242
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,720
All the sick and way down low, now boys.

243
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:35,720
You know, back at 1965 when I first recorded this song,

244
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,720
the very first thing our hot shot New York City producers did was,

245
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,720
they went and they edited out the second verse.

246
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,720
What about the cowbell?

247
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,720
So what that means is, every single time you guys have heard this song

248
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,720
throughout your whole life, you've been cheated out of the second verse.

249
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,720
So I come here tonight to write along standing in justice.

250
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I come here tonight to set the record straight once and for all.

251
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
You know why?

252
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Because the buck stops right here.

253
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
So tonight we're going to play for you guys the missing.

254
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
The second verse.

255
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,720
So beware's a red dress, yeah.

256
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,720
This is all that's a hills.

257
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
But my slew beware's that red dress, Lord.

258
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
You know it gives me the chills.

259
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,720
What slew and when I see you walking, walking down that street.

261
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,720
I say you know slew big girl.

262
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
You know the one for me.

263
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,720
So where's the hell?

264
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Hang on.

265
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
Stupid.

266
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Is that being hang on?

267
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Yeah.

268
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I almost heard you sing at the last song.

269
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Hang on.

270
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Stupid.

271
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Stupid.

272
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Hang on.

273
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Yeah.

274
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Yeah.

275
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Let's give it to him right now.

276
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:37,440
Okay boys, let's see if we can win!
