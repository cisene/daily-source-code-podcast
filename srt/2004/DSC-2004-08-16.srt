1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:17,980
Yeah, once again, it's the source code.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,940
Today is the 16th of August, 2004.

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,460
Hi everybody, I'm Adam Curry.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,700
Welcome from Curry Castle in lovely Belgium.

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,460
And of course, just as I'm about to start,

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,220
this looks like everyone's coming home.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,500
Okay, my daughter.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,220
She had some kind of insect sting on her arm

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,220
and she went to the doctor's cell and showed me

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,700
how it is in just a second.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,940
So I'm back on the radio for the final two weeks

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,620
my tenure, my year-long tenure.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,100
Started this morning, got up at 3.30.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,980
Yeah, that was quite a shock after about 10 days off.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,140
Although, you know, even on vacation,

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,740
I couldn't really sleep in at all.

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,740
Once you get into the rhythm, it's it.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,180
You're just in the rhythm.

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,380
I was getting up at 6.30 every morning.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,660
And actually as of September 1st

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,020
when there's no more radio show,

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,140
I still think I'd like to try and get to bed on time

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,180
and get up early.

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,980
Yeah, it's just, there's advantages to it.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
Let's see what's going on in the world today.

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Big news.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,800
Paris Hilton's sister, Nikki, also heres to the Hilton millions, hundred millions,

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
billions.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
God knows what.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,720
Got married in Las Vegas yesterday to a 33-year-old money manager from New York.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,220
uh

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
coincidence

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,180
And I want oh yeah

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,740
You may or may not have heard the the fuck the FCC song. I was it who did that Eric idle from

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,220
Monty Python

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,100
I

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,500
Figured I just play that because there are still a lot of people I've noticed in my

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,940
Environment who haven't heard it and so brilliant and especially to think that a Brit had to do this

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,900
You know this is the great protest song

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,060
If there ever was one of what's going on with the with the FCC and I'm just gonna play it for you

41
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,200
Here's a little number. I wrote the other day while out duck hunting with a judge

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,300
Fuck you very much the FCC

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,180
Fuck you very much for finding me

44
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,940
Five thousand bucks a fuck so I'm really out of luck. That's more than how you deflice was judging me

45
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,960
So fuck you very much the FCC

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
See you.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,480
For proving that free speech just isn't free

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,120
For clear channels a dear channel

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,000
So Howard Stern must go

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,960
Attorney General Ashcroft doesn't like strong words and so

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,680
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs per rush limo

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
So fuck you all so very much

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
So fuck you very much dear Mr. Bush

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,360
For heroic early sitting on your tush

For Halliburton and Ron all the companies

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Hail!

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,200
Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,960
She's an over dear rich bitch

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,160
And at least she isn't male

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,880
So fuck you all so very much

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500

Forgiving all the lascas oil away it really is a bummer when I can't fill my hula

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,700
The ozone so no-go-zone now that Arnold's here to say the nuclear intergames are going to take place in LA

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,860

So what the planet fails let's save the great white males and fuck you also very much

70
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,820
That's just perfect. Oh, hold on a second. I can now actually hear myself on the headphones without

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
some huge delay. Oh, that's good. Mm. Nice. I wonder why all of a sudden that work now.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,960
Hmm. Alrighty. I also hear my wireless mic set cracking a little bit here. Oops. Almost

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:51,240
dropped the battery, huh? So, a great protest song there. Just love that. What else has

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,560
been going on? I've been, oh, listening to an excellent audiobook. Timeline by Michael

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Criton. It's the unabridged version, which means in total it's 14 hours worth of spoken

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,800
words. Speaker's actually pretty good. He's doing accents because part of it, at least

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,000
the part that I'm at now, is situated in France, so he's doing French accents. So,

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,720
no, it's actually quite cool. Good book. And I bought it off of Audible.com. Really convenient.

79
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,480
I'm big audiobook so much. And since I didn't catch much on the iPad,

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,100
Potter script the other night. So for Dave's audio blog, I figured I'd just

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,780
listen to a book I'd already downloaded, so I'm kind of in the middle of that.

82
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,700
And I actually did have a great chat with Dave Weiner. We talked about our audio

83
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,660
blogs and it seems that we're almost doing a radio show together. But there

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,060
are people listening, I'm looking at my server logs and there was at least

85
00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:01,220
well, there was over a hundred downloads of a second show that I did. And we're

86
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,860
talking about how much room there is, so much room for improvement in

87
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,900
distributing our audio and video files, the stuff that we make. You know, this is,

88
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,660
we've got all the bits in place and I think a lot of it pertains. You know, a

89
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,860
lot of the blogging stuff we're doing will fit perfectly with audio and video. A

90
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,900
lot of it won't really wasn't intended that way. And it's just interfaces. You

91
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,740
know, all I think all the stuff is there. It's just how do we make it as simple as

92
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,380
possible. And the day that Tricia, my wife,

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,320
You know, has an iPod that she just slips into the cradle and it automatically downloads

94
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,520
her favorite music channels from whomever.

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,800
Or it could be a cooking show or a new show or an interview show or it could be all kinds

96
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,340
of different audio files without actually having to do anything else but just click

97
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,440
a box to subscribe to something.

98
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,800
That's when we've achieved success in my book.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,720
Let's see, about seven minutes into this now, there's not a lot going on.

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
It is a Monday.

101
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,840
I guess everyone's just kind of getting back to work now after vacation.

102
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,880
So an opportune day to play a song of the day.

103
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,920
Actually I felt like playing some country in Western.

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,600
Don't get a lot of that over here.

105
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,640
In fact, most people over here hate country music and a lot of people in America hate country

106
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
music too.

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:31,520
But this is a classic that everyone loves and it is by Mr. Country himself, Johnny Cash.

108
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,940
I like to stay out and help us on some songs play the guitar for the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,920
Thanks, my business. Make me shade a little hip on the guitar. All right

110
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:54,420
Well my daddy left home when I was three and he didn't leave much tomorrow and me just this old guitar an empty bottle of food

111
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,260
I don't blame him because he running here, but the meanest thing that he ever did was before he left

112
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,360
He wouldn't named me Sue

113
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, he must have thought that it was quite a joke and it got a lot of laughs from a lot of folks seems

114
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
I had to fight my whole life

115
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:24,300
Some cow would giggle and I'd get rid and some guy'd laugh tonight bust his head. I'll take it life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

116
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:32,900
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up seeing my fist got hard my wits got keen

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Roll from town to town to hide my shame

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But I make me about the moon and stars

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I search the haunted Thompson bars

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And kill that man and give me that awful name

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well it was Captain Burger in mid-July

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I thought I'd stop and held myself a groove

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Had an old balloon on a street of mud

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There at the table, he'll instead

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Set the thirty mange you talk, name me Sue

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
From a worn out picture that my mother had

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He was big and bent and pretty and old

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I said, my name is Sue

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How do you do?

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now you sit down

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, but I told him

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Well I hit him hard right between the eyes and the eyes.

137
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
He went down but some nice surprise.

138
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.

139
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Well I busted a chair right across his teeth

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
and we crashed through the wall into the street

141
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
kicking in a gouging and the mud and the blood and the beard.

142
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I told you I bought the Tucker men,

143
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
but I really can't remember when.

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
It kicked like a mule and it bit like a crocodile.

145
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,500
I heard him laughing and I heard him cussing.

146
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
He went for his gun to pull mine first.

147
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
He said they're looking at me.

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
I saw him smile.

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
He said, son, this world is rough.

150
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,500
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough.

151
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along.

152
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,500
So I give you that name and I said goodbye.

153
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
And you'd have to get tough or die.

154
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
And it's that name that helped to make you strong.

155
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Yeah. He said, now you just bought one hell of a fight.

156
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
And I know you hate me and you got the right to kill me now.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I wouldn't blame you if you do

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,040
But you ought to thank me before I die for the gravel and your guts and the spitting eye

159
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,120
But I'm the son of a bitch that named you soon

160
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,820
What could I do I got old chills tough and I flew down my gun

161
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,080
Called him upon he called me a son and I come away with a different point of view

162
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,720
And I think about him not then every time I try every time I win

163
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,240
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him bill or George anything but

164
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm legendary Johnny Cash boy named suit

165
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,600
On the daily source code

166
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Just want to wind it up with a couple of things whoops

167
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,520
One is the Olympics now we've all noticed that no one has blocked

168
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,660
logging from the Olympic Games.

169
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,300
And I think I know why because the Olympic Games has nothing to do with what you think

170
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,820
the Olympic Games are.

171
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:53,440
The prices are too expensive for the individual events, at least for common people, just to

172
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,260
spend a few bucks and go to your game.

173
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,180
It's all invited officials and members of the International Olympic Committee and the

174
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,500
National Sport Federation and the National Olympic Committees.

175
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,740
And it's all cronies and it's one big advertising you have to make for television events is

176
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,100
what it is.

177
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,980
And you can even see how the directors are cutting the shots so you don't see, hey baby,

178
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,580
how are you?

179
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
My God.

180
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,020
Yeah, but your arm is in a, what is this?

181
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
This is an entire...

182
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
I'm actually...

183
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,360
I'm gonna grab my arm because I had an allergic reaction to some kind of...

184
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,060
I'm staking that that animal had that...

185
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,540
That bug had some kind of infection?

186
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Shit.

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,880
It's completely red associated with this on. I'm actually not allowed to use this

188
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm recording this by the way for my show. Okay. Yeah, but I'm not allowed to use it for the week really

189
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,400
but I'm still gonna go when can you ride you can't ride. I'm still gonna go

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,640
Wednesday. But you're not allowed to. Yeah, but you're not allowed to. Yeah, but you don't want your arm to get worse.

191
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,800
Witness witness the logic of a 14 year old. Okay, but they don't know what kind of animal it was that

192
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:28,600
stung in. The stinger. Well, it looks very official. Looks like you're officially wounded. Okay, I'm gonna wrap this up.

193
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:40,480
One last thing. Just a quick plug here for BloggerCon 3. The date has been chosen. Saturday, November 6, 2004. And it will be held in...

194
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,100
I'm from Palo Alto, California at Stanford Law School.

195
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,780
I definitely plan on attending.

196
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,980
And that's it for the source code for today.

197
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,740
I'll be here tomorrow with more thanks for listening.

198
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,420
If you have any...

199
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,760
Oops.

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,440
Yeah, my assistant calling, hold on a second.

201
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,000
Chris Lee, wait till I tell you through.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yup, bye.

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
