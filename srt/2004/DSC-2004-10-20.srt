00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome everybody, welcome to the source code for Wednesday October 20th 2000 and 4 coming to you from the highway between Belgium and the Netherlands.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's your source code, I'm Adam Curry, welcome everybody to the show.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've got to be honest, I've started today's source code at least five times and couldn't get it the way I wanted to and quite honestly just didn't have the emotional energy to get into it.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let me explain what happened yesterday, I missed the source code, I wasn't able to tape, let me tell you what happened and again it's taken me quite a while and a lot of conversations with a lot of people before I decided to record today's source code and tell you what I have to say.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yesterday I went with my sister Tiffany, who's two years younger than I am, we have another sister Willow, she's four years younger than I am, she lives in Italy, she couldn't come with us but we took our mom to the hospital to get the final results of her test.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yesterday we found out that she is tested positive for lung cancer.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now you can understand why I didn't cut a source code yesterday.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My mom divorced my dad when I was 22, 23 years ago and he also lives in Holland but ever since I've become the man of the family.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you're supposed to take care of all kinds of stuff.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So yesterday going through all this and hearing what the options were and just lending emotional support kind of fell on my shoulders because you got to be strong and got to help everybody through this.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was hard I couldn't bring myself quite yet to record a show and in fact this morning I started recording and I lost it and for the first time in I think more than 20 years I cried like a baby.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, it's like one of these things and I know that there are hundreds of thousands and millions of people probably tens of millions of people that go through this every single day and families and it affects so many people and many of you listening me will probably have experiences with this and you know kind of what we're going through.

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So let me give you a little bit of background on what's happening. First of all this is the thing that sucks the most is she looks great. She feels fine.

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The reason why she went to get went to the doctor was she had a cough that wouldn't go away and they discovered after it took an x-ray lung photo they discovered that she has a tumor low in her right lung.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Which is about six centimeters big at this point from what they can see it is not spread to other parts of her body.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It is the non-small cell form of cancer which is not the most aggressive kind it's guess what we call just a regular old fucked up cancer.

17
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And because it's so low and because we can't see any spreading she has a chance after she has a PET scan which is a radioactive scan where they can get even closer look to see if there's any other cell forming anywhere else in her body which they couldn't see on regular CT scans.

18
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She has perhaps she has a chance that she can be operated which means they'll either remove half of her right lung or all of her right lung if she has enough lung capacity in the left lung to live a normal life.

19
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have to know that my mom has been a smoker all over life of course.

20
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And wouldn't you know that she quit about three quarters of a year ago she has finally quit smoking so of course this is exactly how these things go right like Murphy pops up and says oh yeah.

21
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Should that not be possible then we resort to radiation and chemotherapy now this kind of comes at a difficult moment for for my mom certainly but you know I'm in the midst of a move we're moving to the UK and only four weeks.

22
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Patricia as I think I've mentioned before has heart disease so you know where you think you're riding on top of the world you know and and you've got money and you can buy anything you want and you can do anything you want and there's exciting stuff on the horizon and there's cool stuff happening and podcasting is exploding and.

23
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And then life throws you curveball and says hey dude this is not what it's all about this is was really important.

24
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So anyway I'm on my way to Amsterdam staying overnight there and I was halfway up the highway and I said you know okay I think I'm ready to talk about this and I pulled off to the side and I'm sitting here.

25
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Kind of parking a lot of a grad of a gas station and just wanted to share this with you because if these podcasts are really going to be.

26
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All about life and and there are own personal shows and we can do whatever we want.

27
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think that it's only fair that I can share this with you and of course I talked it over with my mom and everybody else and and they're all totally cool with it and maybe it's a good therapy for me to.

28
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
To get some of this off my chest so I really appreciate you listening to this.

29
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

30
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was not going to play any any music in today's show that was not licensed.

31
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This is something that we've been talking about the all since we've been doing podcast and I'm certainly the four runner of breaking the rules by playing music which I don't have the rights to play and.

32
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And it's unnecessary really when you think about it because you know there's so much music out there and I'm going to hit on that a little bit later on in the show.

33
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But I'm just going to break the law one more time if you don't mind playing a song for my mom because we will get through this definitely with a little help from our friends.

34
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you.

35
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Thank you.

181
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Thank you.

182
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you.

183
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thank you.

184
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Thank you.

185
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Thank you.

186
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Thank you.

187
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Thank you.

188
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you.

189
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you.

190
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Thank you.

191
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you.

192
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Thank you.

193
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Thank you.

194
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Thank you.

195
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Thank you.

196
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Thank you.

197
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Thank you.

198
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Thank you.

199
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Thank you.

200
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Thank you.

201
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Thank you.

202
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Thank you.

203
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Thank you.

204
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Thank you.

205
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Thank you.

206
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Thank you.

207
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Thank you.

208
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Thank you.

209
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Thank you.

210
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Thank you.

211
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Thank you.

212
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Thank you.

213
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Thank you.

214
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Thank you.

215
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you.

216
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Thank you.

217
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Thank you.

218
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Thank you.

219
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Thank you.

220
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you.

221
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Thank you.

222
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Thank you.

223
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Thank you.

224
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Thank you.

225
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Thank you.

226
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Thank you.

227
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Okay.

228
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Thank you.

229
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Really well produced.

230
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Thank you.

231
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Thank you.

232
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What is the fight between you and my master?

233
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Try to take over the world.

234
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Are you on your block of mind?

235
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I can't!

236
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
What in the world is this?

237
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There seems to be no sight of me.

238
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
How much it works here?

239
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now you see that people will always try them.

240
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Because good, you dumb.

241
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Welcome to the five speed cassette audio blog.

242
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
My name is Mark.

243
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Hopefully you'll remember me for my first instalment.

244
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's jump right in.

245
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Today's two topics will be indie music.

246
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Or I should say a call for indie music.

247
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And F1 and its problems.

248
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
By the way, if you can hear those wonderful wind charms in the background,

249
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Zach is providing some atmospheric music.

250
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He's on one of those little play triangle things.

251
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I call him a play triangle with two pieces of metal.

252
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The whole bunch of toys hanging from them.

253
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He's currently kicking along.

254
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So if you hear that in the background,

255
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Zach is having a moment of Zen.

256
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Okay.

257
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Let's start off with the indie music.

258
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yes, I know Zach.

259
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You want your moment in time.

260
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You know what?

261
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I think I'm going to do all my recordings with Zach in the background now.

262
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So to add a family touch to this whole thing.

263
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah.

264
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Pretty funny.

265
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay.

266
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'll admit that a lot of people right now, I shouldn't say a lot of people.

267
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But so far, I've come across a number of very good podcasts that are doing indie music.

268
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And they're doing it quite well.

269
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I must say my current favorite has to be hardcore in some new radio.

270
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Once again, it's on the aggressive side.

271
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's kind of edgy.

272
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I've already contacted him.

273
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Seems like a really nice guy.

274
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So he's already kind of got that covered.

275
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The other day, I was listening to Evil Genius podcast.

276
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And I heard him talk about, let's all get on the bandwagon to play non-R-I-A music.

277
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Now, I'm totally in favor of that.

278
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Unfortunately, my library youth.

279
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Unfortunately, consistently consistently of R-I-A music.

280
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I got to go and find a CD.

281
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Of a gentleman who was Daniel Cox, classically guitar.

282
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's really great stuff.

283
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Flamenco type stuff.

284
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I'll have to play a track or two from him.

285
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So you have a nice idea of some of the things that I'm looking for.

286
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Oops.

287
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Sorry about that.

288
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You hear what's happening is that we're now finding each other.

289
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We were talking about podcasting in the beginning.

290
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Now we're talking about music.

291
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And I agree with Dave Slusher's call to screw it.

292
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Let's play non-R-I-A music.

293
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's become a force.

294
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I know we can do this because there's enough of us.

295
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And we've got the platform.

296
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But we need someone to really start sorting this out.

297
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And the director is going to be a big help at iPod.org.

298
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's going to help us find podcasts.

299
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
But we're going to need a little bit more than that.

300
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And a good example of what I think is needed is the indie feeds.

301
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Again, you can get it from the music directory at iPod.org.

302
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And the indie feeds are basically all single podcast feeds that feature one song per podcast.

303
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And it's the intro explanation about who the song is.

304
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then it's the song.

305
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And then there's an outro.

306
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And you can choose between pop rock, latin, jazz, funk, soul.

307
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
There's like five or six categories, three more that are being announced.

308
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And this, I think, is a perfect way for someone who's trying to promote a certain type of music

309
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
to get that into, to get everyone's attention.

310
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Because now all I do is subscribe to this feed.

311
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And I'll just listen to stuff.

312
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And these are, of course, recommendations that are coming from this podcast.

313
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But it gives me a real simple way to say, okay, man, maybe not this one.

314
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Ooh, ooh, I like that one.

315
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You know, and then I can just literally, in fact,

316
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
normally I would have stripped off the beginning in the ending.

317
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So I have the whole song.

318
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But, you know, the song is right there.

319
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't have to go figure out where to get it from.

320
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
All the information is contained within the podcast.

321
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And I like this song because, hey, it's not rock.

322
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You know, I want to play something different.

323
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm not just a rock dude.

324
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Also, you know, be indie music.

325
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It doesn't have to be only rock.

326
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's kind of that connotation there.

327
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And I really like this song.

328
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It may be chuckle because it's so true,

329
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
saying that you'd hear in this song over and over is, hey, you know what?

330
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But you run your mouth and I'll run my business.

331
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Here's a sampling from the indie feed.

332
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Get your feed independent music at indie feed.

333
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This is a San Francisco based country blues band called

334
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's electric.

335
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And their song is You Run Your Mouth.

336
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business brother.

337
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business brother.

338
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Always telling me what to do now.

339
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

340
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You run your mouth and I'll run my business brother.

341
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You clamp your liver lifts and I'll run my business brother.

342
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You clamp your liver lifts and I'll run my business brother.

343
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Tell everybody you're my pal.

344
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You wind up telling me how to handle my gal.

345
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You run your mouth and I'll run my business brother.

346
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You flap your face and I'll run my business brother.

347
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You flap your face and I'll run my business brother.

348
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Always telling me what to do.

349
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

350
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You flap your face and I'll run my business brother.

351
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You clamp your liver lifts and I'll run my business brother.

352
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You clamp your liver lifts and I'll run my business brother.

353
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Tell everybody you're my pal.

354
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You wind up telling me how to handle my gal.

355
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You run your mouth and I'll run my business brother.

356
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You clamp your liver lifts and I'll run my business brother.

357
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You clamp your liver lifts and I'll run my business brother.

358
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You tell everybody I'm busted.

359
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You talked so much you got me disgusting.

360
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You run your mouth.

361
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'll run my business brother.

362
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You run your mouth and power on my business brother.

363
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You run your mouth, power on my business brother.

364
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Tell everybody, you're my pal, you want to tell me how to hand on my cow.

365
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You run your mouth, power on my business brother.

366
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Deletrics, self-titled album can be found at Solana Records.

367
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That's at www.solAArecords.com.

368
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Get your free independent music at Indifeed.

369
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So this to me is the perfect example of someone who's really promoting independent music,

370
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
non-RIA music exactly the way it should be done.

371
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
A little more space between the beginning and the ending, that would be even better.

372
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I like that song, you run your mouth, I'll run my business brother.

373
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
From the mailbag, JR Boyan sent me an email, said,

374
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Adam, what are these whipped cream balls of which you speak?

375
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Now, you probably remember on earlier podcast Patricia walked in and gave me a dessert,

376
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
which was, and actually Leo Leport played this bit on a show on Los Angeles, on a radio show.

377
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And they were, indeed, whipped cream balls.

378
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
JR goes on and says, as I know whipped cream from the States, at least,

379
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
it isn't quite thick enough to form a sphere, searching on Google, I turn up, she mayl porn.

380
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Probably not, well, your wife brings you.

381
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Well, unfortunately not, JR.

382
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But this is a Dutch treat, it's called a Rome sushi.

383
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And it's kind of about the size of a horse testicle, actually.

384
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So a nice round sphere, and it's made of dough.

385
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Injected into this ball, is whipped cream.

386
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So you bite into it and you get this, you know, the nice dough taste,

387
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and then the cream just kind of explodes in your mouth.

388
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Are you getting a visual on this?

389
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Good.

390
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Then let's go to Helsinki.

391
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Today is the October 18th, 2004.

392
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is a pilot episode of the podcast called My Corner.

393
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
My name is Matt Carrickip, and I'm from Helsinki, Finland.

394
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
As you can hear, I'm not an native English speaker.

395
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And actually, that's one reason why I'm doing this.

396
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
When I first heard about this new media called podcasting,

397
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I immediately thought that this would be a great way to practice my oral English skills.

398
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So if you hear me trying to find words or stammering,

399
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
that's because I'm still learning.

400
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Well, I didn't quite get the name. Was it Mirak? I thought,

401
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Hold on, let's see, go back and see if we can hear what his name is.

402
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Oh, man, you hear that's almost impossible.

403
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
My name is Matt Carrickip.

404
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Matt Carrickip?

405
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
My name is Matt Carrickip.

406
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Matt Carrickip?

407
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh, that's tough, hold on.

408
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Say it with me now.

409
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
My name?

410
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
My name is Matt Carrickip.

411
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Matt Carrickip.

412
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, his podcast is titled My Corner.

413
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I listen to the whole thing.

414
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Your English is excellent, by the way.

415
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This does bring up an interesting point because I saw a conversation,

416
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
a discussion on, I pointed out, or about,

417
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the language element in the RSS feed for a podcast,

418
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and that we are requiring the language element to be in there.

419
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I wonder, is Finnish a standard selection?

420
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I hope so.

421
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Because, you know, wow, we're going to require language.

422
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We're going to have to make sure every single one is in there,

423
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
because we've gone from Germany.

424
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We've gone to Australia, Italy, now Finland.

425
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This podcasting thing gets around it.

426
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Another great podcast that came up

427
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is something that you can find at openpodcast.org.

428
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And openpodcast.org is basically an interface,

429
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
a way for you to upload your own MP3 file,

430
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
that will then automatically be included in the openpodcast.org podcast.

431
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So, just like with the indie music feed

432
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
that I played a couple of minutes earlier,

433
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I was just one segment that goes in.

434
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's a great way to promote new podcast.

435
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I think that's what OpenPodcast is meant for,

436
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you know, for people that just, you know,

437
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
send in a little promotional bit about their own podcast.

438
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Maybe an example.

439
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't know if there's a time limit to it,

440
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
but some amazing things are coming through.

441
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And I want to play you something that I heard first,

442
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and then I went to find this person's podcast.

443
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What's going on?

444
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Well, as you said, with Scratch Pro Chronicles,

445
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
this is definitely what I was talking about on my show,

446
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
the other day, having people just send in

447
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
the hot portions of the show or give a little segment of the show.

448
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And so people can know that they exist, you know,

449
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
get all the feed, all in one rip.

450
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
This is hot.

451
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Openpodcast.org, send your feed in.

452
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Like people know that you exist, please.

453
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay, so that intrigued me immensely.

454
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm like, this is not someone I've heard on the podcast before.

455
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm going to go to the Scratch Pro Chronicles,

456
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and here it is.

457
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Oops, hold on.

458
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Scratch Pro Chronicles.

459
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Join the podcast.

460
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
No, I've got a crazy idea out of two blocks now.

461
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Check it out for them.

462
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
This side you freak out.

463
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You go get the clean joint, right?

464
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Boom, now, now all you all you die.

465
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's this shit, my head.

466
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Boom, and this, you know what I'm saying?

467
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Any color you want, but it would be like,

468
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
blow a cream.

469
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You know what I'm saying?

470
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Shit, like that.

471
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Make it, don't even know where this is going.

472
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm gonna rock, think it's a symbol.

473
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
On the real.

474
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You know what I'm saying?

475
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yo, sir.

476
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I had crazy business.

477
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Check it out.

478
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Check it out.

479
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Check it out.

480
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Just imagine if you buy, woo!

481
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Check it out.

482
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right?

483
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
A navy blue, a navy blue pair, right?

484
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Boom.

485
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But it's shit.

486
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
No, sir.

487
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But I get to that cream.

488
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's like an M&M documentary.

489
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I love it.

490
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's fucking crazy.

491
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So check out Scratch Pro Chronicles.

492
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It's all kind of music is out there on the podcast.

493
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And I'm not sure about Scratch Pro Chronicles, especially with all the sampling,

494
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
what the legality is of that.

495
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But there's some great music.

496
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's see if we can figure out ways to promote non-RIAA music.

497
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Let's come up with a norai.

498
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
No, norai, norai.

499
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Look, independent music.

500
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's stuff that needs a helping hand.

501
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And stuff that clearly is good because there's a lot of great stuff out there.

502
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm going to leave it with that for today for the source code, if you don't mind.

503
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I'm staying with all night here.

504
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And I'll kind of know there's source code tomorrow.

505
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'll have new things to talk about.

506
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Some new music.

507
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm going to stay up tonight and list a whole bunch of new podcasts.

508
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's got some cool stuff, cool tunes.

509
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And thank you very much for listening.
