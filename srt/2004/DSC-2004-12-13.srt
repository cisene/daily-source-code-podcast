1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,020
Ladies and gentlemen, Islanders of iPod, behold our new sovereign leader, bow down for the

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,560
Earl of everybody, the Duke of Doyle, the parent of broadband, the Sultan of Starbucks,

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,080
the king of his castle, and the tyrant of peace-pilling, but most of all, the prince of

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,820
pod, Mr. Adam Curry!

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,320
Adam Curry!

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,400
Please obey his rule for he shall punish you at SIGTO YOU AGAIN!

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:51,560
Get ready baby, oh Adam, Adam, oh, it's the daily source code!

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,560
Everybody, it's Monday, it's December 13th, 2004, welcome to the daily source code where

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,560
users and developers party together on feeling good friends, family, world leaders.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,360
I know you're all listening to this podcast.

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,560
It's time for your source code.

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,840
I got everything I want, right here, right here in my cottage, baby, I got my tea and

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,040
I have it on the other side of the wire, so we won't have the horrific tea-spilling accident,

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,600
reprise the low-echatars, cannot handle it whatsoever, man, I got a jam-pack show for you,

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,520
actually took a screenshot of my flat panel display that I have on the low-echatars, so

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,320
you can see how many different sound clips I have lined up for today's show.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,240
It's about 20 hours, it's about 20 hours, it's about 20 hours, it's about 20 hours, we've got

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,480
comments, we've got music, we've got feedback, we've got lots of stuff to talk about, particularly

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,600
well, we've got so much feedback on the trade secrets that the David I did, I got to talk

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,320
about that a little bit, see what else do we have lined up.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,160
It's just an incredible amount, you know, particularly because on Friday I did the podcast

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,440
from Studio A8 with Anneli, Anneli Nuitts, who, by the way, she's not a reporter from

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,640
wired, she's a journalist and she's a writer, and she was hired by wired to do this particular

24
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
piece.

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah, this profile on me, the profile of the Prince of Bob.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Okay, this actually tells you a little bit more about this show.

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Greetings, program!

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
It's not any time for a drum song, because we use it.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm certainly in the mood for a party.

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,240
No time for that now, the computer's starting, can you please program us out of the system?

32
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,640
Shall we play a game?

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,840
My user has information that you can make this a free system again.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
It's party time!

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,720
Yeah, for me the RT, why?

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,120
Because I got up!

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,320
This is your daily source code.

38
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Yeah.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Hey, bud!

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
This party!

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Wow!

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,680
Your users and developers are party together.

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,440
Oh, I can't thank you guys enough for all the shit you send in to me, it makes

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,280
my job so wonderfully easy.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,040
One of the things that I've been getting a lot of feedback on is download issues with

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
the source code.

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
There's about time that we talked about this on the show, because at first I thought,

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,120
well, look, there's so many people subscribing, there's got to be a certain percentage

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
that will just fall by the wayside, and I think that's still a part of the issue here.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,400
But I have seen myself, and we're also using the same servers for Don and Drew, and

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
I know we've offered it to cover Bill, I don't know if cover Bill needs any help yet.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,760
But I have seen some intermittent download issues, and I'm not quite sure, I'm pretty

53
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,600
sure it's not our server, because we've got a server that's doing nothing else, but

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,840
just sitting there and serving up files.

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,120
We have an unmetered pipe on that server.

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,040
Now, granted that there's a limitation to it, and I think that we're, see, they're 20

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,360
30 megabit pipe, which should be enough.

58
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,200
I mean, what's happening here is there's so many people trying to grab these files at

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,800
the same time that it is slowing down.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,360
The slowness is not a problem, when it stops, that's when it clearly is a problem, and

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,880
something that we've got to figure out.

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:55,640
I really don't know what could be doing this other than, well, it's still, of course,

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,200
it could be the server itself, although I doubt it, it's just getting hammered by requests,

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,120
but it's not really that.

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,360
I have my doubts about it being the bandwidth provider, because that seems just like,

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
it's okay, the bandwidth is there, somewhere there's something taking place, it's not

67
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,800
right, and there's another thing that we probably should look at, and lots of comments and

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:23,040
emails about this in the production show notes for this particular source code, is we need

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,480
resumable downloads, because I, you know, with my, as too far as of thus yet, still deprived,

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,480
or bandwidth deprived situation, I've had a lot of time to play around with what works

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,920
and what doesn't work, and most podcasts, by the way, are so popular, and I guess even

72
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,600
more than a couple hundred people subscribing is popular enough to crunch most pipes

73
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,480
throughput, that they're really not coming in that much faster than modem speeds, depending

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,000
on when your iPodder is grabbing this stuff, of course.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,520
So if I run my iPodder at night, I pretty much get everything I want in the morning,

76
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,200
even though it's coming over a phone line, because it's still bringing it in sequentially.

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,080
So if you sleep eight or nine hours, I pretty much get the podcast I need, because it could

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,560
take an hour for, an hour for basically a 40, 45 minute to an hour podcast to come

79
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,880
in, depending on how it was encoded.

80
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,120
But sometimes shit does just happen, particularly on dial-up, you know, you get kicked off,

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,320
bandwidth just goes away temporarily, and I think that's something that we need to look

82
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,800
at in our iPodders in the, you know, basically the iPod, catching the podcasting clients

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,520
is, how do we ensure that if it's something breaks, that it continues to try and get it,

84
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,440
or at least gives up after a smart, something after ruleset, something that really means

85
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,120
it's not available, because if this is happening to me, it may be happening to Don and

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Drew, and it could be happening to a number of people.

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:03,800
And I actually, I created my, my really real poor man's iPodder in OSX on the command line.

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,160
This is a wonderful command called Curl, CURL, and if you give it a URL, and so let's

89
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,800
just say I give it a URL of an MP3 file, what you want to do is you want to give it an

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,520
OSWITCH, a capital O and a capital C. The capital O, so basically you do Curl space minus

91
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,600
capital O, which means it's going to output the same name as, as it is when you're downloading

92
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,360
it, and then the minus C switch means it's going to check and see if it, if it, if it

93
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,080
has to resume this download, and it works really, really well. I've been using it, so I had

94
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,040
this whole list of URLs that have stuff that I want to download that aren't necessarily

95
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,840
iPodder subscriptions, just stuff that I've seen, maybe coming through an audio.weblogs.com.

96
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,600
So I added to this list of URLs, and if I want to do something else, because of course,

97
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,000
that's the problem if you're downloading MP3s, you don't really have a lot of bandwidth left

98
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,200
over to do anything else, or basically you don't, certainly not the porn that I'm used

99
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,000
to do on download. So then you just hit Control C, and it stops that, and then you can

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,680
fire up that process again, and it picks up where it left off. So, resume will download,

101
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,240
something we definitely got to look at in the iPodder community. And so Melts, we got

102
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,440
to keep our eye on, is these damn mashups, man. I love them. Check this out. It's a mashup

103
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,440
from SmashUp Derby. What the fuck is going on? Jet Lady Joe. On the source code.

104
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,440
That would be your day to source code, but Monday, December 13th.

105
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:48,440
What the fuck is going on?

106
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:58,840
They be Madonna. You're natural feet. Wonder how you manage to make ends meet. Who finds

107
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:06,440
the money? When you pay the rent? Did you think that money was so good?

108
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,440
They'd be Madonna. Baby have to rest. Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.

109
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:29,440
They'd be Madonna. Right on the bed. Listen to the music playing in your head.

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Said I ain't going to remind you.

111
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Baby, Madonna. Baby, Madonna. Baby, Madonna. Baby, Madonna. Baby, Madonna.

112
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I could see you. Oh, baby. But you are with me. I can't help. I know we got

113
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:50,440
but to save the money to get away. Yeah, be my girl. Be my girl. I can't help being my girl.

114
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Be my girl. Be my girl. I can't help being my girl.

115
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
SmashUp Derby. Jet Lady Joe. What the fuck is going on?

116
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm listening to my own show. I listen back to it on my iPod.

117
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
I'm going to rewind that. Listen to it again. I suggest you do the same.

118
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Welcome back. How good was that?

119
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I have to apologize because so many cool things were sent in.

120
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I thought I'd kind of organized a lot of the emails.

121
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,440
What happens often is someone will send something like this Jet Lady Joe.

122
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
This mashup, smashup Derby.

123
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,440
And it'll come in an email and then I will save the MP3.

124
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,440
And I thought I'd save the email that went along with this, but clearly I didn't.

125
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,440
This is my pathetic attempt at an excuse.

126
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Podcast. Podcast. Podcast.

127
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Podcast. Open Podcast.org. Podcast.

128
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Podcast.

I've got 75 gigabytes of bandwidth just waiting for this guy.

134
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
So, come on over and check it out.

135
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
That's the new pickup line by the way. Hey, baby.

136
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I got 75 gigs of bandwidth. Why'd you come over my blaze and dig off your dress?

137
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
This is your daily source code. I'm Adam Curry.

138
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
The Prince of Pod. Oh, we're going to get to that later.

139
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
There was another Prince of Pod thing. Oh, I have so much to do with unbelievable.

140
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Lots of responses to the trade secret podcast that David I did.

141
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
First of all, about the sound quality, I have to admit we did a test with my with my phone recording

142
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
it before we did the show, the whole show.

143
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
And the test did sound better than the way the show came out.

144
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Part of that is Dave's voice is completely just shot.

145
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Actually, this is a recent podcast that he's done.

146
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
It's to call the Dave sexy voice demo.

147
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Just listen to how he sounds. It's not very good at all.

148
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,440
And this is a more higher quality recording than the one you had on the trade secrets podcast.

149
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm very intense evening of schmoozing and hanging out with the people at Berkman and Kennedy School

150
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
and Joe Trippie and Zach Rosen.

151
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I have almost no voice left. It's a really getting ridiculous.

152
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm asked to go see a doctor.

153
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Luckily, they have good doctors here and they know me.

154
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,440
So probably if it doesn't give much better signal probably going anyway.

155
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,440
It's one of the demos you all could hear how sexy one of the voice sounds.

156
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Oh, maybe I got 75 gigs of bandwidth for you sexy boy.

157
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Okay, so we got a lot of comments about the sound quality.

158
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Also, when you, if you don't talk directly into the phone, you know, when you kind of,

159
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
I don't know, I think it's, we weren't paying that much attention.

160
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
We're having a good conversation actually.

161
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
We weren't paying a lot of attention to the sound quality.

162
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,440
And this is, now you're seeing how hard it is to really make sure you get something.

163
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
You know, maybe you appreciate the sound guy.

164
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
It's a little bit more.

165
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
When you see him with that big boom microphone and all those meters and dials.

166
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I mean, this is what's about.

167
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
It's very difficult to get good audio.

168
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,440
And particularly if it's more than just one person talking in a space and you want everything

169
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
to kind of sound the same and everything to be, to be legible.

170
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
And some people actually had no problem at all.

171
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
You know, it's, it's all a matter of what you can here actually.

172
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,440
But anyway, the, the content of the conversation is what really it was good for me.

173
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,440
And the fact that we, you know, have these, have had these plans to start a company.

174
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,440
It's really good to be able to just talk about it now.

175
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
Just say, okay, so we don't have a name for it yet.

176
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,440
But otherwise, you know, we're pretty far along with, with what we want it to do.

177
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,440
And, and you know, as we were talking about the three, you know, there's basically three parts to it.

178
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,440
But the most exciting I think we all agree is, is the podcast is the content itself of these shows that we're making.

179
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
And, you know, what is it?

180
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
I mean, I'm still trying to capture, you know, this magic.

181
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
I don't think it's capturable.

182
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,440
It's, you know, the magic is something that's out there and you can't really define it.

183
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
And, but somehow it's, it's working.

184
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
It really is working.

185
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,440
And, and I got to tell you, if for someone who's been in broadcasting so long, I'm totally used to people saying,

186
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Oh, you know, saw your show or heard your show, yes, they would ever.

187
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,440
But now when people say, I heard your podcast, it's, it's, it's great.

188
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I mean, it is, it's the same.

189
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,440
It's basically the same feeling is, is, you know, the first time I was really on big time radio or on, on MTV.

190
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
But it's, it's a fresh new feeling because it is something new.

191
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
It is something fresh sky.

192
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,440
I mean, that was a, what the hell we're doing.

193
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
But, a lot of people certainly want to help, even if they do or don't understand it.

194
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,440
And I'm going to play a bit of this audio comment that that I got from, I think it's,

195
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Todd and I'll interrupt him here and there to talk about some of the topics he's producing.

196
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Hey, they're out of Mrs. Todd.

197
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,440
And, I just listened to the latest trade secrets.

198
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,440
All I can say is, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring boring.

199
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,920
boring boring boring boring boring at any rate i'm really excited about you guys getting

200
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,040
the ball rolling with a company and i'm sure it's early for this but i'm gonna help out

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,560
i want to do whatever i can i'll make myself fully available to you guys so if it's for

202
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,920
brain storming or any little bit of coding that i might be able to do or whatever i'm there

203
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:03,320
find me at studiogeek.org and uh yeah this thing's gonna be great thanks

204
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,840
i was um i was thinking of a different comment that's gonna come in that was talking about

205
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,160
some OP mail stuff but uh Todd thank you very much for your generous offer and boring indeed

206
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,680
and this is what we're what we're seeing all kinds of people are saying hey you know count me in

207
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,680
and whatever we could and it's not like i'm looking for a job that's what i what i like about it

208
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,600
i've also heard some uh some negative noises you know like oh i thought you guys were only

209
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,080
you know trying to build a vibe in in podcasting and like well that's exactly what we're trying

210
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,480
to do and wouldn't you rather that you know people are gonna make money in podcasting so

211
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,480
ones and people are already making money and if it was just about money believe me either i or

212
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,440
Dave could have started to make money in a number of different ways lots of people are offering

213
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,960
sponsorships and you know but that's not what this is about there's something much

214
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,880
much bigger that that that is coming it is truly it is the people's media it is the people's

215
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,960
network um when someone said a long time ago the internet is like citizens banned fucking you know

216
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:09,880
it's it is it's true only the you know we're not limited to the 40 sandals channels uh and uh 40

217
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:17,000
upper side band and 40 lower side band remember the SSB oh man i was so into that i was so

218
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,720
in the SS single side band uh CB radio when only we cut cut resistors in the next the chipset

219
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,880
and it would give you another or a diode i think it was it would give you another 120 channels

220
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,120
anyone out there you should do that it would use to sit on those upper frequencies near the 28

221
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:39,640
megahertz band anyway um i should almost replay what i just said to figure out what i was trying to say

222
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,360
yeah uh my point being that you know if people are gonna make money on on podcasting and they're

223
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,200
gonna create companies and uh i think anyone would want to at least have a company in the market

224
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,920
place that is open and and you know and honest about what they're doing and what their intentions are

225
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,240
and is basically trying to party with everyone else to figure out what we need to do so uh but right

226
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,320
after um right after Christmas um when my uh when my conveniently with my in-laws are here

227
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,400
that's when i take off to the states i'm gonna hook up with uh with Dave and Ron and uh we're gonna

228
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,720
you know get some uh get some shit going so i'm extremely extremely excited about uh about that

229
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,760
and throughout the podcast hope to touch out in the gosh already 20 minutes i gotta hurry along here

230
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,480
i'll be touching on more more stuff as we go along and this is Chris Chaffey in Richmond Virginia just

231
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,120
want to say i love the show and make a comment about the religious podcast that you've been

232
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,640
shined on your show i think this is the first time that religion has found the technology on

233
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,320
the internet before pornography uh i just thought that was really interesting and um so anyway keep

234
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:54,600
up the great work and y'all talk to later uh boy oh yeah religion found well but what is religion

235
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:02,600
and what is pornography and are the interchangeable here's a clip from the new dawn and

236
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:16,520
drew movie road to ruin so tonight at the dawn and drew um house the cause the dawn and drew

237
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,480
house what you're listening to is the dawn and drew show right but there's the dawn and true house

238
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:31,240
and the dawn and drew car and the dawn and drew barn that's right so this is taking place in the

239
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:40,120
dawn and drew kitchen that's in the house everything has brand to do see i see i i gotcha okay so

240
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:48,280
i'm with you don't interrupt me okay okay remember okay i talked about this okay

241
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,920
true okay i'm not going to talk go ahead are you going to not interrupt me i will not interrupt you

242
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,240
promise promise can you make that promise i'll try all right

243
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:13,080
or more sounds like these subscribe to found sound dot net audio fragments from around the web

244
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,680
that's like some kind of really twisted performance art but i'm totally digging that and there you go

245
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,760
it's the dawn and drew house the dawn and drew kitchen it's all sponsored everything's brand

246
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:39,480
is that what we're going with dawn and drew i don't think so um and was it um Wednesday or Tuesday

247
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,160
i was taught well spoken about uh dawn many times of course because yeah she's like my girlfriend and

248
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:53,240
um the fact that she said something to me at bloggercon that has been such an incredible

249
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:02,440
stimulus such a motivating factor in me staying away from all types of tobacco now remember i still

250
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:10,600
like the holy herb but very little of it but no tobacco and it was very easy actually to go back

251
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:18,840
through the production notes on dawn and drew dot com which are also an opml which and which is

252
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,880
this outliner format if you if you haven't seen this before um we're hoping david and i are hoping

253
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:34,040
you get an open source outliner out there so you can play with this yourself but essentially

254
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,360
that's that's how the production notes are made and that's how i can you can look at them on the

255
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,120
web that way and it kind of an outlone outliner rendered format but what i really like is looking

256
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,600
at them in an outliner and you can just you know click stuff and it's all kind of a one place

257
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,840
but it also makes searching this outline very easy and so i just you know when and look for some

258
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,960
references to smoking and i came up with a December second uh podcast uh dawn and drew show and

259
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:07,240
actually the bit that well the stimulating um piece that the dawn said that um i want you to hear

260
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,400
because it it really has helped me stay away from tobacco um it really has let's uh drop it

261
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,600
to the conversation you're only being heavy that i could contribute to this earth okay so basically

262
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:27,000
talking about um about uh dawn's mom she would be a smoke in our baby's face and i said that too

263
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,920
i said grandma cannot blow smoke in baby's face and my mom said i blew smoke in your face and

264
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,120
you're a baby to make you not want to smoke cigarettes which i don't smoke it's a good thing then

265
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,280
and i'm quite anti-accus smoke yes i am because it kills you yeah and your boyfriend alluded

266
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,480
today in a show that he put out yesterday that uh he's still and that he still hasn't smoked

267
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,080
now isn't this nice don't we have a beautiful open relationship

268
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:02,600
it's so nice to know that you know drew recognizes that i'm dawn's boy

269
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,800
good job Adam you guys if you smoke cigarettes you're totally sucking on the

270
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,160
cock of big brother that was it that was the entire line listen to it again because it will help you

271
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:21,000
as well it is beautiful if you smoke cigarettes you're totally sucking on the cock of big brother

272
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,640
and that that is that goes so deep in so many ways just sucking on the cock of big brother

273
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,000
yeah i i should play this over and over in my life if you smoke cigarettes you're totally

274
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,040
sucking on the cock of big brother there you go play that over and if you're smoker play that

275
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,480
over and over again and think about what that really means and that's your choice and you're right

276
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,680
because it's your body but go for it there's gonna be drew and I and Adam gray whatever one i'll

277
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,880
that's right all right a clip for the archives ladies and gents here's the uh the longer

278
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,920
uh comment that came in that i want to discuss a little bit about uh this is from uh coanbremor

279
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,280
Adam hi this is coanbremor uh calling from the new forester a few miles to the south west of

280
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,880
you at the moment uh just a few things first of all by the way it's a colleague from the UK

281
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,280
all uh i wanted to say thank you for playing music by the lascivious videos on the daily source code

282
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,040
i heard you play famous by them and thought that a few seconds of that will be a fantastic intro

283
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,960
and outro to my own podcast um so following your example i emailed lianne uh west over uh who

284
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,960
replied with a lovely email uh among other things given me permission so respect to yourself for

285
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,360
making me aware their music respect to them for saying yep you can do that and i was

286
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,160
chuffed a piece is to hear that they're uh they're selling tons of CDs as a result of your

287
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:54,280
plugs so uh so well done everybody who's uh bought CDs from them i was also uh interested in

288
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,600
your comments about iPodda and some of the drawbacks when you're in a restricted bandwidth situation

289
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,440
man i got to put this whole thing up so you can listen to him talk about uh he has so many good

290
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,320
ideas that i'd hope that the iPodda developers listen to this oh put this uh up as a separate

291
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,880
MP3 file i want to move ahead because he's he started to talk about OP about what the second

292
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,560
thing is i was wondering whether i was actually missing a trick with the OPML file whether it was supposed

293
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,640
to be used in some way with the um with the MP3 file uh i suspect probably not but then i've got

294
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,360
to thinking well what if you could you know what if now check this out because this is what i've been

295
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,680
trying to figure out i've been trying to figure out the you know these OPML files basically it's

296
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,720
perfect for for production and i've and i've you know i've done radio production for a long time

297
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,040
so to have an outline or to be able to do that works beautifully now the thing about these

298
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:48,600
about OPML and and what what Dave and i call the uh he calls the internet outliner so i've

299
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:54,760
picked up that that word the internet outliner um because it's all connected and i can open up

300
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,400
the outline to someone you know to someone else's outline it's exactly the way if if you're

301
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:05,240
maintaining a node on the iPodda or directory or if you want to i mean basically all i need to do

302
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,480
is is create an OPML file and these are all linked together so it seems logical that that's

303
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,080
exactly what we're going to do with these production nodes how that ties into the actual RSS feed

304
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:24,120
and the actual um ID3 tags i'm not quite sure that's what i'm looking to figure out what if the

305
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:31,080
technology was clever enough to to consume the OPML file while you're actually playing the MP3 file

306
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:37,800
so for example you could embed the name of the OPML file in one of the ID3 tags and then a suitable

307
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,120
client be that a software application or media player of some sort or a hardware device like

308
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,480
a you know an ex-generation iPod or something like that could for example display the appropriate part

309
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,680
of the OPML nodes when you're at the appropriate part of the MP3 file or possibly even interacts

310
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,560
depending upon your um security settings right i'd like to start simple first of all i mean that

311
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,040
that would be that would be the best part that would be the easiest and it's all just about ease of

312
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:12,440
used really i mean this is just to be able to to see something simply um and it's really um i have

313
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:19,080
all these tools that that i've collected and i've been working on um that allow me to just basically

314
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,800
hit a button and any MP3 files that i've thrown into this one folder on my desktop is then loaded into

315
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:32,360
an outline and it's loaded in with you know uh by the ID3 tag so it's the artist the album which

316
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:39,000
is usually the person uh and then you know uh sometimes they'll have their URL as the album uh and

317
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,640
then the actual sound clip itself which of course when i double click that sound clip and uh again

318
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,600
i have this uh this great screenshot that i'll uh that i'll put up for you uh that i should

319
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,920
did of uh just before i started today's podcast when you double click on that no then uh it opens up

320
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,720
the appropriate MP3 file in a quick time player and it starts playing it uh so it's just it's just

321
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,440
an interface basically and ease of use i really see this ease of use but we can connect it all together so

322
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,000
that's the kind of stuff that we got to figure out um and i'll make a note here that i also

323
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,720
put up uh cones entire uh wait there's also an email version of his comment oh that's cool okay so

324
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,760
I'll put that in the uh in the production notes as well and moving right along more promos

398
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,480
stuff going on the christmas cast um and i was talking to uh uh to analy new it's um i don't

399
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,040
we've talked about on the podcast on Friday or not but we certainly talked about it at Starbucks

400
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:40,200
how how shitty it really is you know that we can't play music that is associated with you know

401
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,240
with with our memories um which you know it was what sharing sharing music should be about

402
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,120
and that especially when it comes to christmas stuff man there is so i mean so many different christmas

403
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:59,880
songs or holiday songs in general um uh or just songs. it means so much to so many people and you

404
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,640
know if i if i were to play a certain song right now it would mean something to you it would mean

405
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,080
mean something to me and and at that moment it's uh it's very powerful it raised up a lot of emotions

406
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:15,720
and the fact that we can't do that is is really a bummer um sucks i think i think i don't know if

407
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,560
i'm gonna be able to make it all the way up until the new year without playing something that

408
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,480
maybe not sanctioned i don't know and of course i'm not gonna get away from the prince of the pod even
