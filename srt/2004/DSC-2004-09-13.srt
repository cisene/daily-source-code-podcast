1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Well good afternoon from Curry Castle in Belgium or good evening or good morning.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Monday, September 13th, 2004, I'm Adam Curry and great to have you aboard.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
We've got a lot of cool stuff to talk about today on the source code.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Of course, iPodder also want to talk about programs.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm thinking of a new program myself that I want to put together, stuff that we need

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
to make these programs doable on our computers.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Of course, I've got a song of the day, a little bit of geek talk, and I also have

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
a comedy clip that I want to play for you today, so lots to get to.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
This is the place where users and developers party together.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
At least we try to.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
In fact, I was thinking about this.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Imagine if we could actually harness the power of all the developers in the world.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,500
And so many people are actually developers by scripting applications,

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
putting stuff together.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
And I've seen in the past couple of days just looking at conversations going

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,500
back and forth between iPodder developers that we really seem to get along

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,500
on common ground.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Imagine if we could have a campaign like developers for carry.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or developers against Bush.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know, there's a lot of power in what developers could do.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Of course, we'd have to be incentivized as developers,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and, you know, so there'd have to be some campaign promises.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Like, well, actually, I set up a conversation I had

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
with Dave Weiner this morning.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Free pizza might be, or free beer might even be enough incentive

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
for us to get us to vote.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Unfortunately, that apparently is illegal.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I want to talk about iPod a bit.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We got a mailing list set up.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I did that at Yahoo Groups,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and I pointed it out on my web blog on live.curry.com.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There's one thing I'm going to be hammering on the mail list.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And, of course, I want to see how everything starts up

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and what people are talking about.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everyone's starting to introduce themselves now on the list.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's installers.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We need to really work on our installers.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We've got all these different versions of iPod

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
that work with Windows and iPods and other MP3 devices

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that can sync up to Windows Media Player.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So we've got everything going.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's just that there's still too much work for users.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It should just be double-click.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's a screen.

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
screen that says, going to install this, you know, here's how you get rid of it if you

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
want to.

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
And maybe one or two questions about some default feeds.

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
And that should be it.

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
It should be no more.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
And boom, it's gone.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
They can forget it.

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
We got it.

54
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Cron jobs are running.

55
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Everything happens instantly.

56
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
That's something we really got to work on.

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I've also noticed that running iPodder, and I know I talked about this before on

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,500
source code, that I'm really using my iTunes almost like an email client now, where, you

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,500
know, a couple of times a day, I have my email client sent to pick up mail every 15 minutes

60
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
because I quite frankly, I just don't want to be bothered any more frequently than that.

61
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I used to have it set to one minute, you know, when I was thinking of ideas or public

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
company that I co-founded.

63
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
And that was crazy.

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
You have no life.

65
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,500
And even though I know that the iPodder runs only four times in a 24-hour period, I've kind

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
of deprogrammed those times.

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
I don't exactly remember when.

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:23,500
So that...

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm surprised.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's the serendipity that I'm looking for where I just pop up iTunes and look at the

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
top of the library list.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, yep, there it is.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There's something new and click on it.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And usually it's a blog digger media file which is hilarious and I've picked up some

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
great things in the past couple of days over the weekend.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So just interesting to see that I'm really using iTunes a lot more than I ever did

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and that's really, it's a joyous experience every single time.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You know, is there something new?

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is there maybe a new Morning Coffee Nodes or is there a new Gilmore Gang?

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
By the way, I gotta tell you, I actually started to debug my iPodder because I

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
didn't get a new Gilmore Gang on Saturday.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Usually I get Friday show, sometimes Saturday morning when I get up and it's

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
already sitting there for me and I was like, oh shit, something must have gone wrong.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I'm checking the log files and I'm looking at all kinds of places and

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
seeing if something went wrong with the iTunes transfer and then I went to the site

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and I saw that, well, there actually was no update, no Gilmore Gang and I'm bummed.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You know, this is...

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Actually, I should say, and I hope Doug Kay listens, or that he does listen once in a while

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
to the source code, is that, man, you got to let us know.

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,500
That's like death for radio and audio programming, skipping a show without a reason.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Especially in this space, the iPod platform space, IPS, is deadly because you have no way

92
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
to promote.

93
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
It's television if an episode is preempted.

94
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,500
then you can promote that continuously and people know about it but there's no way to tell people.

95
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
And if you don't have it on the weblog, just see this as a complaint.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm bummed. I like that Gilmore Gang.

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,500
There's an excellent format for what we're doing here with iPods and other MP3 devices.

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
And we'll also have to start looking at publishing tools fairly soon

99
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
because we're going to get bored of the same shows over and over again

100
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
even though there's new stuff.

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,500
We need some variation and we need to help people enable their RSS feeds

102
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,500
or just get RSS feeds out there so that they can start publishing stuff.

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:44,500
And we have to make it the exact same simplicity that we've done on the receiving end with iPod

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
so we need to figure out ways that people really have to do nothing

105
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
to get their RSS feed with enclosures out there

106
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,500
so that any iPod or enabled device can grab it, download it automatically by subscription.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been talking to a couple people about this on email and phone conversations.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Something came in which I thought was pretty cool was a Python screen scraper script.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to have to link to that where if you basically publish an HTML page with links

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to MP3 files, it'll create an RSS 2.0 with enclosures file of that page.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But of course that's not really, you know, I don't think it's a very elegant way of

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
doing things because I'd rather have stuff that's archived properly and hold on

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
a second, sounds like my wife is coming home. One sec, let me just see.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Someone's certainly coming home.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The dogs go crazy.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Alright, let me get back here.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now Andrew Groomit. Is that the way you pronounce it, Andrew?

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He sent me an email about something he just posted which is a small Python script

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
called DER 2 RSS.

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,500
So basically you drop this into a directory somewhere on your hard drive, which is in

122
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,500
your web server's documents path, which means you can access it on your local drive, but

123
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
it is also accessible through a web browser.

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,500
And you fire up that script, and in the folder it creates a little file called rss.xml, and

125
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,500
in that is the contents of that folder with some information that you said that you preset.

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Like the name of your channel and the number of entries you want to contain.

127
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And it will maintain that file.

128
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,500
So every single time you add something to it, if it's a watch folder that script

129
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
should run automatically or you just run the script and you've got it, and

130
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
then any web server can access that file.

131
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Now you'd really want to run that on a server somewhere, and

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I think then we get into some complicated territory where it should be just

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,500
an application that is as simple as give me an address of either your web

134
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
log so we can hopefully take care of it through a web log.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the blogger API or even better the meta web blog API or give me an FTP server and

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll drop the file there and then of course after I've dropped that file there

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to ping web blogs comm or something like that to let the world

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
know that the feed is has updated and I was talking to Dave this morning as it

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
was how it's actually interesting was this morning for me last night for him

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
because he's in Seattle now and he said that I had actually come up with a

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
solution or figured it out and as he said that I was thinking did I think of

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that or I couldn't remember but anyway what he said was right it's exactly the

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
opposite of what we're doing with the RSS files creating playlists from the

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
channel information oh hold on hi hon yeah

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
yeah these both that was her who came home

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
right so about so that's on the receiving end where we basically on the iPod or

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
unpa...

148
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,500
the RSS feed and from that information that's in there creates folders to store the files,

149
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,500
creates a playlist, etc. What you want to do is you want to make it so simple that if someone

150
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:25,500
creates an mp3 file, all they need to do is really edit the ID3 tags because that'll give you

151
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,500
all the information you need to create an RSS file out of that. And there's many ways it

152
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,500
can be done. There's even a command line tool that I've seen for changing ID3 tags that you

153
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,500
can attach to a watch folder. I mean I think somewhere in there is the way to do it. And

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,500
people who are interested in publishing something will certainly already be familiar with the

155
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,500
concept of ID3 tags and editing those. So this will just be a little button next to it which

156
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,500
says publish and then it's going to FTP your RSS file to an FTP server that a web server can

157
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,500
access and also FTP your mp3 file up and that should be it. It should work.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
as simple as that and I'm going to of course try and bake up one of my own versions.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, that's enough for iPod. Let's talk about programs, shows like this for a second.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've gotten quite a bit of email questions about the legality of me playing music on

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the source.

162
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
which is, you know, all right, sue me.

163
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
You know, who's losing in this game

164
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
and how much of a thief am I in this particular case?

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
And of course I'd be more than happy

166
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
if I were to make money on any kind of program,

167
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
just like all broadcast radio stations do,

168
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,500
you give a percentage, usually between two and 6%,

169
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,500
to ASCAP, VMI, and a couple of other foreign agencies.

170
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
They'll be happy to do business with us,

171
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
but right now, you know, we're not really stealing anything,

172
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
just enjoying some old tunes now and again.

173
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
And what's interesting about it is that everyone talks about,

174
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
oh, well, you're playing this song, you're playing that song,

175
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
but not once has someone said, well,

176
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
how about that tune that you played?

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
code which is the Rachmaninoff Burris remix here I'll play it for you for a second.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This one.

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You know why?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's because we're not conditioned to think that way and if playing Kiss I was made for

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
loving you was stealing then this is stealing just the same.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is probably already a remix of someone who took stuff from someone else that was

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
originally composed by Rachmaninoff.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's a whole bunch of aspects to look at and I think this is sounding pretty loud here.

185
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Oh

186
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
One, two, three, four.

187
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Okay, well...

188
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Another big note to self.

189
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Gotta check the batteries before each show. This is the second time this has happened to me. This drives me crazy.

190
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,500
You know what? I have another battery. So why don't you bear with me here?

191
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:40,500
I'll have to feed back now. If you want to then you can just fast forward this piece of the

192
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
program.

193
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I took the old battery out. It's on the receiving end of the wireless set that I have.

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I like about doing this on a Mac, because this is all like hot swappable.

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can do this on the fly.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And now I should be able to switch back to the...

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There we go.

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
To the better microphone.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Now of course you know that my mic battery is going to go.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Or what I'll do is when I get to the song of the day, I'll change that one just to

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
make sure.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay.

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So we already mentioned the thing about, you know, no one thinking about the tunes

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and there's all kinds of copyrighted material all over the place.

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And there's a way to solve it if we're doing programs like this and we're making money on

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it.

208
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And that way it's just to hand off a percentage of your growth revenue.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's done in broadcast all over the world.

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think the only thing that's different is the actual percentages themselves.

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Could we just adjust this here?

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Mic is good.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Okay.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So now we talk about programs and there was a nice post by Steve Kirk's.

215
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,500
which now I want to get to. My computer screensaver just kicked in.

216
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
His post is called Have a Take, Don't Suck.

217
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
And in there he says, well first of all he's very nice and compliments me

218
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,500
and calls me the gold standard of audio web blogging.

219
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
You know, the whole essence of this piece is that he's recognizing

220
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
how these programs fit together and how there's a format.

221
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
He actually speaks of a format and that, you know, there's not

222
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,500
not every one or everybody is going to be appropriate for doing this type of stuff.

223
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
You know, and there's a lot of prior art to look to.

224
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I posted a link to Steve's posting.

225
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
So just have a read on that little plug.

226
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Now some stuff that came in through the iPodder,

227
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
some interesting programming thoughts.

228
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
This of course came through BlogDigger.

229
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
It's a class of speech.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
by William S. Burroughs, who I hadn't heard of before.

231
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The speech is about something called the wishing machine.

232
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And from this, if you do a Google search

233
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
on William S. Burroughs and a wishing machine,

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
you'll run into all kinds of really interesting stuff.

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He's passed on.

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He died in 1997.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And this is an hour-long speech

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that he did on the topic of the technology of wishing.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And there's two things I want to play this clip for you.

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Two reasons why.

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
One is just so you can hear his brief introduction of his speech.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And the second one is listen to,

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and this is dated from 1985 or 87, I think,

244
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
listen to how this technology now can be used.

245
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Here's someone who's just going to walk in,

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
is going to put down a recorder.

247
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,500
guy's speech and here it is still living years and years and years later and

248
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,500
totally distributable and you could make an archive of these and there you go

249
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
you could distribute them through the iPod platform. Anyway so listen to

250
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
this I'm gonna let you hear the piece where the guy is who recorded this is

251
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:12,500
actually setting up the microphone for the speech by William S. Burroughs.

252
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
June 24th, 1986.

253
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
June 25th, 1986, William Burroughs of Gamble Sigma,

254
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Norwey Institute's Emeriting Program.

255
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Now you hear there between his introduction and William S. Burroughs actually talking,

256
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,500
it sounds a lot like the source code, lots of dead air, and microphone noises.

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Good.

259
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:57,500
The subject I will address, first subject I will address, is of interest to young and

260
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,500
old, man and beast to everyone without exception.

261
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It's the subject, it's the technology of wishing.

262
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,500
How to formulate your wish in such a way that it has some chance of being real?

263
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,500
And a consideration with last popular appeal, the responsibilities involved in wishing,

264
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
you might say the ethic to wishing.

265
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Okay, so that's just a little piece there of William S. Burroughs and you can see how this

266
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,500
can be pretty enthralling, you know, it's just like another audiobook as long as the

267
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
audio is actually decent.

268
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,500
In this case I think it was, they must have plugged directly into the microphone.

269
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Something else that I came across from, oh it's Free Reads from Jim Kelly.net.

270
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Jim Kelly is a writer and he actually introduces exactly what he's doing and why he's doing

271
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,500
these things.

272
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
introduction before each book. So I'm going to play that introduction for you. It's a

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
little on the soft side, so you might have to crank up the volume. But it's interesting

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
to hear how he's going to use the iPod platform and also his motivation behind it. Here's

275
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Jim Kelly from JimKelly.net with an introduction and then I'll let you hear the first couple

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
paragraphs from his story, The Best Christmas Ever.

277
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Hi, this is Jim Kelly. Welcome to Pre-Reads.

278
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm releasing the story you're about to hear under a Creative Commons license.

279
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Basically, it means it's free.

280
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Copy it as much as you want, send it to your cousin in Kalamazoo, or your pal in Poland.

281
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,500
All I ask is that you don't alter the file, or delete this intro, or the app to follow.

282
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,500
If you like what you hear, you might consider clicking over to my website,

283
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,500
www.jimkelly.net, and putting a little something in my PayPal account

284
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
to cover my costs of studio production.

285
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
How much? That's entirely up to you.

286
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I'm no actor, but I am the author of the stories in the Free Read series,

287
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,500
and I've tried to perform them, more or less as I heard them in my head when I was writing them.

288
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
As the contributions roll in, if they roll in,

289
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I hope to return to the studio to record more of my work.

290
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
In any event, I'm glad to have you as a listener. Enjoy!

291
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The best Christmas app.

292
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay, a couple of observations here about Jim Kelly.

293
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
First of all, I think it's really cool what he's doing by putting this together.

294
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The thing that really hurts me here is that he is having to go to a studio and sounds like it because the quality is really good of his read.

295
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That he has to go to a studio and pay someone money to get this kind of quality where you can easily get this kind of quality on your PC.

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There should be no problem at all. There's enough processing power in there, enough digital signal processing chips.

297
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It all should be possible. Users and developers are a huge crevice between us there on what we really need.

298
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The biggest problem is that users don't know what to ask for as usual because we don't really...

299
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,500
know what the capabilities are. I mean I'm slowly turning my power book here into a

300
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,500
portable studio but something different than all the applications have been made

301
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,500
for. Something that creates a sound file on the computer and that can mix

302
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
everything together all virtually. That's really what's happening here. And of

303
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
course it would be nice if we could match up the right readers with the

304
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,500
right story writers because you know although Jim does an excellent read I

305
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,500
think you really there's a lot more as an advantage to have that you can gain if

306
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,500
you have someone who has the right type of talent for doing a read of an

307
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:38,500
audiobook. So a lot of matching up to do if possible. And I've been talking to

308
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,500
lots of people and been thinking about doing an additional show. So you know the

309
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
daily source code of course stays and thinking about something weekly perhaps.

310
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,500
And as a part of that or maybe a whole show hold a for show all together if anyone

311
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
out there.

312
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
is feeling good about it, we need an audio book review program definitely.

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And it should be so simple.

314
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I've even thought about this.

315
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We could modify iPodder so that if you're listening to, let's say there's a feed, an

316
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
audio book review feed, which of course is great if you have time to listen to it, which

317
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
is where you're going to listen to audio books anyway.

318
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And it's a show and it comes in every single day and there's a review of maybe one book

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
with an excerpt.

320
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And if you want it, then you just hold down the play button on your iPod.

321
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It marks it to a special playlist.

322
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
When you reconnect, boom, it goes out and talks to Audible or BarnesandNoble.com

323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
or whoever you're going to buy, Amazon, wherever you're going to buy this from,

324
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and pops it up.

325
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It already knows that it came through the audiobookreview.com show.

326
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And there's a transaction all over the place.

327
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There's a market there.

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And I'm so certain that audiobooks are just going to grow and grow and grow as

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
more iPods and MP3 devices.

330
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:06,500
are out in the marketplace. So, yeah hon? Yeah come on. Come on. Yeah I'm still busy.

331
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Yeah. Give me a hand please. Yeah, okay.

332
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Is your hand sharp enough? No man. That's over your feather.

333
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh you're...

334
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,500
This is Patricia who brought me a nice bowl of chicken soup.

335
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Because it's rainy? Mmhmm.

336
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm gonna catch, wanna go out, and not allowed to. Thank you hon.

337
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Bye.

338
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
very nice. So I've been thinking about a show with a co-host. Actually, I've been talking

339
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:47,000
to someone about a show as a co-host. And, you know, we're not quite there yet. But

340
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
just from a technology standpoint, now I'm thinking, how can we do this? And I wrote

341
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it, I tried to explain this on my web blog today by writing about it, found it kind

342
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
of difficult, or I don't think anyone will understand what I'm saying.

343
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
In the broadcast world, when you have, I'll say, a radio show and you want to talk

344
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
to someone else who is somewhere in a different country or different world or

345
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
different state or around the corner, just not in the studio, what you need to do is

346
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
either lease a line, you can do connections through ISDN, that's how it's

347
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
done often, so you get a nice clear quality, or you immediately downgrade to

348
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a telephone, which of course is the easiest, cheapest way and almost

349
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
anybody can use it and has access to one. And part of the big promise of the

350
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
internet.

351
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
of course especially for broadcasters is hey you know we can connect to anyone

352
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,500
And I think the CNET television used to do that once in a while that have a bit where

353
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
you could call in with your net meeting, video chat software, and oh, I suck, that never looked

354
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
good.

355
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
And it probably still wouldn't today.

356
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,500
But that was years ago until for its time, or for the period of time, way ahead of its

357
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
time.

358
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,500
But now I think that if I'm going to do a radio show with someone else, there should

359
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
be no reason for us to both be in the same room at the same time, yet we should be

360
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,500
able to capture an equal fidelity quality of us talking.

361
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
And we should be able to have a real time conversation just like we're talking on

362
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
the phone.

363
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
And of course, I've already been interested in voice over IP and I thought,

364
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:26,500
wow, you know, what we need to do is we need to hook up either Skype or some

365
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,500
type of chat program so that we can basically hear each other and then

366
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
record the output of both.

367
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
And as I thought it through, give up with some issues.

368
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
One is the way I have it set up now so that I can record my microphone and

369
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and any other sound that I make on my Mac,

370
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm basically recording through a program called WireTap,

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
which just anything that'll come through the speakers,

372
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
WireTap is going to record.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Now, my microphone, if I just plug the mic in

374
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and there's no application talking to it,

375
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
it's not gonna do anything, you won't hear it.

376
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Therefore, WireTap can't record it.

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So I use Apple's GarageBand kind of as an amplifier

378
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and I turn the monitoring on in GarageBand.

379
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I can set some effects and some EQs

380
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and because I can hear it through the speakers,

381
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
it will be recorded by WireTap.

382
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Now, if I want to use Apple's iChat AV for instance,

383
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
to talk to someone else to have them on the show,

384
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I could certainly record what they're saying

385
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
because I can hear it through the speakers,

386
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
therefore this WireTap program will record it.

387
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But my microphone is already being used by another application,

388
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
so how am I gonna make sure

389
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that the person on the other end hears me?

390
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So anyway, I figured it out.

391
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
which is very interesting is that for some reason with these two applications probably

392
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:56,500
because they are both Apple programs and use the core audio, my microphone can actually

393
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
be accessed by these two programs at once.

394
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,500
So now I'll be able to record my voice.

395
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I'll be able to record whoever's on the other end of the iChat AV and of course when they

396
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
get audio conferencing I'll be able to do it with a whole bunch of people which will

397
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,500
be fascinating.

398
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,500
I can also at the same time any sound effect or any song or anything I play on any media

399
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
player, any sound that I make with my Mac even like turning up the volume.

400
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Hold on, did you get that?

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There you go.

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Any sound that comes out of the speakers will be recorded by wire tap.

403
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But then there's one problem there is that when I play a clip, the person on the other

404
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
end won't be able to hear that clip because then I basically have to hold a microphone

405
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
up to the speaker and that's not the way it should be done.

406
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So I've toyed around with a couple of different programs that let you route audio from one

407
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
program to the other.

408
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm just having a little bit of this chicken soup here.

409
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah, it's good.

410
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I couldn't really get those to work the way I wanted to, so I haven't quite solved

411
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that problem yet.

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But this is going to be so huge when we all figure this out and we start to want to make

413
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
these type of programs.

414
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
This is going to be such a market for software to do this stuff.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's going to be awesome.

416
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So anyway, that's on the horizon.

417
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'll update you as everything unfolds.

418
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay.

419
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Song of the day.

420
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's a classic one.

421
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
This is really a song that is perfect for the weather here today in Belgium.

422
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It was raining all weekend.

423
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's been dark and musty and wet and just continuing to drizzle and then rain off and

424
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
on again.

425
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So there's no other song more perfect for a day like today than the Mamas and the

426
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Pappas.

427
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Of course it's Monday.

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
so good to me

429
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,500
It just turns out to be all

430
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Monday Monday

431
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
And trust that day

432
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Monday Monday

433
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Monday Monday and just think if Karen Carpenter and Deaton Mama Cassis ham sandwich we would

434
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
have still had two great singers with us today.

435
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And I apologize I'm not quite sure what happened during the song but for some reason the whole

436
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
computer froze up once or twice and I'm sure that was reflected in the recording but everything

437
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
seems to be running so I just let it go.

438
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I figured this whole program has been crappy enough.

439
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I might as well add that to the mix.

440
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Quick bit of geek talk.

441
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I've been noticing that Google is doing some stuff that I'm not seeing a lot written about

442
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
but I have picked up on a couple of links I'm not quite sure I understand it.

443
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Excuse me.

444
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh great chicken soup.

445
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
One of them is Google FS or maybe it's Gmail FS it seems that somehow there's an API

446
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
or there's some way to address Google specifically Gmail.

447
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I think it was Google FS which stands for the file system.

448
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:16,500
away from Linux for you to mount your Gmail Drive space, which of course is one gigabyte.

449
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,500
And along with that, there's another application, a little program, which is also something

450
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,500
you have to download and work on Unix.

451
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
But that's where all the, you know, a lot of the fun stuff does seem to start.

452
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
It's called Galina.

453
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,500
And what that does is whenever you send an email to your Gmail account, it automatically

454
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,500
generates a blog post on a web blog page.

455
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,500
So, you know, it seems to me like there's something really interesting going on there.

456
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,500
And are people just finding these APIs or is there active development going on?

457
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Or, you know, what the hell is it?

458
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,500
And while you ponder that, I want to play something that I discussed when I was

459
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,500
talking to Dave, Dave Weiner, who was temporarily at least has moved to Seattle.

460
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
He's going to be there at least through the November 6th BloggerCon conference,

461
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
which I'll, I'm attending and I'll be leaving.

462
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
a discussion on, gee, shall we do it about this?

463
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So that's a lot of fun to look forward to.

464
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So we're talking about that and talking about our upcoming move to the UK.

465
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And there's a lot of exciting stuff and just stuff you run across when you're moving,

466
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
your financial stuff and changes of addresses and letting everyone know what's going on

467
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and then your stuff.

468
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And Dave said, well, you know, I'm to the point where my stuff fits in one car.

469
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And I'm like, yeah, you know, I have a wife and a 14 year old daughter and our stuff just

470
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
doesn't fit in one car.

471
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's just no way.

472
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And we've got lots of stuff.

473
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And I said, have you ever heard the George Carlin bit about stuff?

474
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And he says, no.

475
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I said, well, I'm going to play that for you on the source code.

476
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So I looked at my iTunes library.

477
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I know I had it at one point.

478
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Couldn't find it.

479
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And so you got to love the internet one quick trip to Lime Wire.

480
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And I guess this came off a bear share client.

481
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It is the.

482
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,500
original piece that George Carlin does about stuff. I'm going to play a little bit more

483
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,500
than just the stuff. There's a commercial and advertisement which comes after it, which I

484
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:27,500
might as well just leave on since it's Carlin to the max. So enjoy this bit from George

485
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Carlin. It's called A Place for My Stuff.

486
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,500
That's my job thinking up goofy shit.

487
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Come around every now and then letting you know what it is.

488
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Or reminding you of things you already knew but forgot to laugh at the first time.

489
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
This is my office over here.

490
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Let's face it, if this is my job, this must be my office.

491
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Looks like an office to me.

492
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Got me a little desk here.

493
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Kind of nice desk.

494
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And a chair.

495
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Chair goes with the desk, of course.

496
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You could sit on the chair at the desk, if you like, making them a set.

497
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Or you can use the chair as an occasional piece.

498
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Which is nice to have in the office, I always say.

499
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Actually this is just a place for my stuff, you know?

500
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,500
That's all a little place for my stuff.

501
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,500
That's all I want, that's all you need in life is a little place for your stuff, you know?

502
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I can see it on your table, everybody's got a little place for their stuff.

503
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,500
This is my stuff, that's your stuff, that'll be his stuff over there.

504
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
That's all you need in life, a little place for your stuff.

505
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,500
That's all your house is, a place to keep your stuff.

506
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,500
If you didn't have so much stuff, you wouldn't need a house.

507
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,500
You could just walk around all the time.

508
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The house is just a pile of stuff with a cover on it.

509
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You can see that when you're taking off in an airplane.

510
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You look down, you see everybody's got a little pile of stuff.

511
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
All the little piles of stuff.

512
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And when you leave your house, you gotta lock it up.

513
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Wouldn't want somebody to come by and take some of your stuff.

514
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They always take the good stuff.

515
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They've never bothered with that crap you're saving.

516
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
All they want is the shiniest stuff.

517
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Put your house is a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff.

518
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Sometimes you gotta move, gotta get a bigger house. Why? No room for your stuff in here.

519
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Notice when you go to somebody else's house, you never quite feel 100% at home.

520
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
You know why?

521
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
No room for your stuff.

522
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Somebody else's stuff is all over the goddamn place.

523
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And if you stay overnight, unexpectedly, to give you a little bedroom to sleep in, bedroom

524
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
they haven't used in about 11 years, someone died in it 11 years, and they haven't moved

525
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
any of his stuff.

526
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Right next to the bed is usually a dresser or a bureau of some kind and there's no room

527
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
for your stuff on it.

528
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Somebody else's shit is on the dresser.

529
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Have you noticed that their stuff is shit and your shit is stuff?

530
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Say that shit off of there and let me put my stuff down.

531
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Sometimes you leave your house to go on vacation

532
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
and you gotta take some of your stuff with you.

533
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You gotta take about two big suitcases full of stuff.

534
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
When you go on vacation you gotta take a smaller version of your house.

535
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's the second version of your stuff.

536
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You're gonna fly all the way to Honolulu. You're gonna go across the continent,

537
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
across half an ocean to Honolulu. You get down to the hotel room in Honolulu

538
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and you open up your suitcase and you put away all your stuff. There's lots of places in the hotel room to put your stuff.

539
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Here's a place to put a little bit of stuff there. Put some stuff here. Put some stuff here.

540
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You put your stuff there. Put some stuff here. There's another place for stuff.

541
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Look at this. I put some stuff here.

542
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Even though you're far away from home, you start to get used to it.

543
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You start to feel okay because after all, you do have some of your stuff with you.

544
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's when your friend calls up from Maui and says,

545
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
hey, why don't you come over to Maui for the weekend and spend a couple of nights over here?

546
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Oh, no.

547
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now what do I pack?

548
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Right. You've got to pack an even smaller version of your stuff.

549
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The third version of your house.

550
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Just enough stuff to take to Maui for a couple of days.

551
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,500
Get over to Maui. I mean, you're really getting extended now.

552
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
When you think about it, you've got stuff all the way back on the mainland.

553
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
You've got stuff on another island. You've got stuff on this island.

554
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I mean, supply lines are getting longer and harder to maintain.

555
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
You get over to your friend's house on Maui and he gives you a little place to sleep,

556
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
a little bed right next to it, there's a windowsill or something. You put some of your stuff up there,

557
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,500
you put your stuff up there, you got your vising, you got your nail clippers, and you put everything up.

558
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
About an hour and a half, but after a while you finally feel okay, say,

559
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,500
all right, I got my nail clippers, I must be okay. That's when your friend says,

560
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,500
hey, I think tonight we'll go over the other side of the island, visit a pal of mine, and maybe stay over.

561
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Oh no. Now what do you pack?

562
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Right. You gotta pack an even smaller version of your stuff.

563
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,500
The fourth version of your house. Only the stuff you know you're gonna need.

564
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Money, keys, comb, wallet, lighter, hanky, pen, smoke, rubber, and change.

565
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Well, only the stuff you hope you're gonna need.

566
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
We'll be back to the album in just a moment. First, these messages.

567
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Say, why not become a schmuck? A licensed, practicing schmuck?

568
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Or if you qualify, a CPS. That's right, a certified public schmuck.

569
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,500
You know, it may not seem like it when you look around, but there is a shortage of schmucks in today's society.

570
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:16,500
And there's big money in schmuckdom. The average schmuck today earns over $34,000 a year.

571
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,500
And there are openings for schmucks in virtually every field.

572
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,500
The government is run by schmucks, big businesses run by schmucks,

573
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
and more and more people are becoming schmucks on their own.

574
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,500
You know, some guys can only manage to be schmucks on New Year's Eve.

575
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,500
But here's your opportunity to become a full-time year-round schmuck.

576
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Give us a call. Don't be a schmuck. Be a schmuck.

577
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:45,500
That's George Carlin. And of course you heard a bit from his very famous, A Place For My Stuff,

578
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
which I just love it, man.

579
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Here's a guy when he's doing some of this stuff, doing a show like...

580
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
this. Wouldn't it be great to wake up every morning to a little look on life from George

581
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Carlin or from John Stuart for that reason? There's a lot of people I'd love to hear.

582
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Just a little, just a little bit about the day. That's it for the source code for today.

583
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
A little bit, a little messy here and there and I'm going to run out and get some more

584
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
batteries for tomorrow's show. As always, if you want to respond, you can send me

590
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Take care!

591
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,500
The power of your new thoughts.

592
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,500
