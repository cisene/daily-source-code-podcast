1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey everybody, who listens to the Daily Source Code?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Daily Source Code podcast.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's for everybody.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Testing.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
All's live.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Adam Curry.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Monday, everybody good afternoon.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I you're doing and welcome to the Daily Source Code.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today is Monday.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's December 6, 2004.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm out of curry coming to you from Curry Cottage in the United Kingdom.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's right.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
With a brand new set of new sounds.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And lots of reverb by special requests.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not even going to get into the entire set up and exactly what I've changed.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But boy, a lot of thought went into it.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In fact, Patricia actually spent a lot of time with me coming up with the microphone sound.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's pretty good.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In fact, it could be a hell of a lot worse.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You know, I could be at Starbucks right now.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's how bad it could be.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's interesting.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Still kind of working on the entire set up.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All the pieces and bits.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Everything that goes together.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's all right here.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is where users and developers party together.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I kind of feel like a little bit of a developer.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you look at the setup that I've got going here.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And part of the reason for this entire setup is

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've been catching some some flack about the sound.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The, you know, basically the big room that I had at the castle.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Some folks seem to actually miss the kind of echoey reverb thing.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And sometimes they even are pretty vocal about it.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Listen to this that came in on my iPod or just over the weekend.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How are you?

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, how are you?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Very well.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So are we recording?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We are.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, this is the sound of excitement in the background.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So what do you want to say?

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Uh, I don't know.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm not a podcaster, you know.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So here we are.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're not?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you a podcaster?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we're not good at this off the coast all the way.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We're not going to sit there and do a David Adam.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And did that our way?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So are we here?

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because Adam insists upon having some sort of a seat for his iPod or network.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Right.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So Adam.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This will have to do.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This will have to do.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All right.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, you know, one of those of you who haven't heard the last week show down low that one.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That was a show with Jonathan Schwartz, right?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It got a lot of good reviews except for people like, you know, who are concerned about,

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
how am I, big ego or HP?

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, those complaints happen no matter what.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So I think it was a good show and I hope people will listen to all the way through because some of the stuff towards the end of some of the best as well.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The point about me, come on.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Get to me.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's what the second I am.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Stephen, I'm great except.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So what are we going to do next week?

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We're going to try and do the full show next week, right?

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We're going to try and record it on Monday.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But we'll have to leave that one for perhaps another little down low.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We're good.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All right.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All right.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So let's hope everybody does go back.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Listen to last week's Gilmour Gang with Jonathan Schwartz, great show.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I know I will.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You know, I will too.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
When Friday rolls around, that's what I'm going to do.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Get to the part about me.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thanks.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's hope he gets his broadband as of noon here on Thursday, which is when we're recording this.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Adam just said email that the British telecom people have not, no, whoever it is is not come through with his DSL line.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Not as this saying because, you know, there's just something different about the sound of this voice when he's got dial up.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Not the attention here.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the bit.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You know, he needs more reverb.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's it.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's it.

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's something about that Mike changed that he's done.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just not right.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We missed the castle.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's just not right.

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I, you know, when the jury's out on the cottage.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But it doesn't really matter.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's what, uh, Adam thinks.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's true.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh.

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Steve, have a great weekend.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And we'll talk to you on Monday.

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thanks for that.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So nice of you guys to be thinking of me.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And so nice to say that it sounds like shit now that I'm in the cottage.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So I've cranked up the reverb.

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Make sure you guys got plenty of it.

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oops.

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sorry about that.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Still don't have the windscreen happening on the new microphone.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I think we kind of got this vibe going.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You know, I've got the drum cadence now on the background.

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is the last time I played that drum drum line, the drum cadence.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I got so many responses that actually started up an email thread with Joel Hawksley.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He said, uh, actually I'll read this email to you.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because I said it was really awesome.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A lot of people had commented on these cadences.

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I said, you know, how did you record it?

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He says it turns out the file.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I sent you a record a while ago.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
My friend Sony microphone and Sony mini disc recorder.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And, uh, what it is, he sent me another one.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And this is of our shoot.

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What was this?

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think this is the Michigan Michigan State drum band.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hold on, I'm trying to get my show notes to scroll up,

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
which apparently is going to be a problem today.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's see.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Come on everybody.

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, there we go. Okay.

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Um, right.

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So of course, doesn't tell me anything about that in the show notes.

160
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Uh, before that, uh, as we opened up, you heard a little bit of, uh,

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Steve Gilmore and Doug K.

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Apparently there was no Gilmore gang to be recorded this week.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And, uh, so that you don't go running off and start checking your, uh,

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
your iPodder and, uh, your scripts to see if something broke.

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You know, there actually just was no show recorded.

166
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So hopefully they'll have one, uh, one up pretty soon.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Um, okay.

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So this, oh, there we go.

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Uh, street beats.

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's Florida State.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Florida State drum line.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The license is non-R-I-A-A.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why did these cats crank?

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Check it out.

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I love that.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, I used to love it.

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I really used to love it when, um, when they'd be doing a, um, a parade.

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And then they'd walk by and they'd do, um,

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the theme from entertainment tonight.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Have you ever heard of a high school or college drum band

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
or the theme to entertainment?

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Uh, anyway, I'm kind of getting into drum, uh, drum band.

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Uh, should we be concerned about me?

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Possibly.

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Good morning and welcome to today's podcast for December 3rd, 2004.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is a brief daily offering of words for the wise and the other wise.

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Today's words from an article Adam Curry read on his abbreviated daily source code.

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The article by Felicity Lawrence is a wake-up call for the Western world's food

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
humorous.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The way we eat is not just ecologically unsustainable,

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but also morally and even biologically unsustainable.

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The word is profligate.

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's listen.

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Food is flown around the world to meet the supermarkets requirements for just in time ordering.

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Their demand for cosmetic perfection and a perpetual glow.

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In case you had noticed, this is, uh, basically me, um,

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
fucking up the read that I did on, uh, what was it, um,

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what was I supposed to get my broadband? Was that, um, on the first of December?

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So that was, was that Wednesday, I think?

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When I, when was I really pissed off?

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, something like that.

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then instead of doing a daily source code,

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'd read this article from the Guardian,

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
which I've actually linked to on ipodder.org.

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I couldn't get this, this word right.

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, you'll, you'll hear it.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We'll summer can be met by producers only if they use agrochemicals intensively

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and allow for a, uh, prof, uh, a big fucking word,

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
degree of waste.

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
A third of Kenyan green beans are thrown away because they are the wrong size or shape.

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Prophligate.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
PRO, FLI, G-A-T-E.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Volume is an adjective that, in this context,

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
means recklessly wasteful, wildly extravagant.

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It can also be used as a noun to describe a profligate person.

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Adam, I want to thank you for reading this editorial to us.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think you and Felicity draw much needed attention to the very serious problem.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Um, hope all of your listeners read this article and hope a few of mine do too.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can find a link to this article as well as Adam's reading of it at today's podcast.com.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please email me with questions.

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Scott at today's podcast.com or send me a voice mail at 435-514-4859.

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Thanks for listening and please tell your friends about podcast.

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, right on.

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you very much Scott.

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Send me straight there.

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Profligate.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can do that.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Profligate.

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And it's good to know what words mean once in a while.

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Profligate.

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So we're sitting here in my new office in the castle.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A couple things still wrong with it.

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I've got this beautiful desk that's antique desk that's Louis the 14th desk.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But my chair doesn't fit under it.

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I guess the Louis guys were really small back in the Louis the 14th day.

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So I kind of like my knees are banging against the bottom of the desk.

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So we've got to figure a way to raise that up to give me a little more.

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A little more breathing room perhaps would be good.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And as you can hear, I'm still using the new mega mic, the the sure SM7.

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've got my reverb set up, Steve, and Doug, hope you like that.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I get a little bit of that castle vibe regardless of the size of the room these days.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And even though I still don't have my broadband and you know,

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm so past the pissed off stage.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm just kind of rolling with the flow on all of that.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I've kind of relearned how much I love the concept of enclosures.

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And the whole iPod or concept because basically what I've done now is I've thrown out all my subscriptions completely.

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
All I have is just basically the pod squad that I subscribe to.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And of course link to the pod squad is on the production notes for today's show.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I only have that download the minute I go to bed.

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So actually the computer wakes up at 2 a.m. at 2 a.m. at wakes up.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And the first thing it does, it fires up iPodder.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And it goes off and downloads the pod squad.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So pretty much every single day I've been lucky enough to have all of the all the files sitting there waiting for me.

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Because it's not so much that the bandwidth is slow.

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because you know, some some podcasts really because they're so crunched just by so many people

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
requesting the MP3 files. They come in pretty slow as is.

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The problem with not having the bandwidth is that you can't multitask.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't download two things at the same time.

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Because that really of course is just no bandwidth.

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So it's not so much that's about the speed of stuff coming in.

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But it's about being able to do multiple simultaneous parallel processes.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Like get your email at the same time check a web page.

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So I'm shifting all that stuff off into the middle of the night.

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So actually where I was telling you to please send me just a link to an MP3 file instead of an attachment.

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm back now to attachments.

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Please, if you're sending me something, if you're sending me a promo to your podcast and I love playing people's promos.

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Send it to me as an attachment.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
As long as it fits within, I think it's three or five megs that my email server allows in.

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because that, you know, basically I just look at the headers and look at the body of the messages.

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And at night once again, I say go out and cash all of all of the attachments.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So by the time I'm up and we're going to bed late, you know,

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm we're going to bed around 1 a.m. for some reason.

274
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Of course, we're seeing a still isn't in school.

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hopefully this coming week looks like she'll be able to start and boy,

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
she really wants to start.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is a great kid.

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
She's like, I want to go to school.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm so bored.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So I then will obviously be going to bed a little bit more in a more timely fashion.

281
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Probably before midnight.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So there's a good nine hours, you know, of just time for the computer to do what's work.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And it's really not that bad.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What sucks, of course, is when someone says, hey, check this out.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I can't do that in real time.

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't really do Skype calls.

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can, but the Skype calls like four or five second delay.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So, in fact, what I'm going to suggest today,

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
if now that he more or less has his voice back,

290
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to ask if he'll do a trade secrets with me later this week.

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to do a double ender,

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the way Don and Drew taught us.

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So Dave will basically record on his end.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll record on my end.

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We'll have a communication like a phone.

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Probably, I think that'll be the best one,

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
phone to communicate.

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And we'll both record our individual sides.

299
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We'll slap those two bits together.

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And we'll have a trade secrets and boys time for one.

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So much has happened.

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
A lot of email, a lot of cool links to non-RIA-based music,

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
which, of course, is what we try to play most of here on the daily source code.

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For instance, and again, all of these emails that I'm reading to you,

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
all that information is in the podcast show notes,

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
email from Joshua.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Josh on the train, actually, who's listened to the source code on the train

308
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and it's called me about that before.

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He says, a thought here.

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Non-RIA music should be freer, freer, freer,

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
F-R-E-F-R-I-A-A,

312
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
which stands for F-R-I-A-A, freer, freer,

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know Josh.

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think we've got to work on that.

315
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know if that's going to work.

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Some freer music that we have been playing,

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that I played a couple times, is the lascivious bitis.

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Bittisforever.com is their website.

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Excuse me, and I've had kind of an ongoing email conversation

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
with Leanne from the lascivious bitis.

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And what was really nice is, she sent me an email,

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and she said, I want you to know,

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
we've sold a ton of CDs,

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and have gotten much more fan mail than usual

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
after your podcast of the list of these bitis.

326
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
We've done plenty of radio and TV,

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and I think the only other thing that got people going

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
like that was when we did the Bobby Flasho

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
on the Food Network.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
All right, we're up there.

331
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Podcasting equals Food Network.

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, the Food Network's all right.

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I haven't had the courage actually

334
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
to ask what a ton of CDs means,

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
but just the fact that by playing someone's band

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
on the daily source code that people are going out

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and buying that CD.

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They're probably buying it from the website.

339
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I cannot tell you how good that makes me feel.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's the same thing with Leanne Wilkins,

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
who we'll talk about later on in the show.

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And Jenny, they're two dogs.

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You've probably heard this from the Friday podcast,

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
where I basically had him on the show,

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and he's trying to get his dogs out of jail.

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
In Atlanta, I total fuck up,

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and he's really just too much money for them to cough up.

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I spoke to him this morning,

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
already they had like $700,

350
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and it was so incredibly cool that people don't know.

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean, people are doing $10,

352
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
$20, $25 to help them out.

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And really, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that.

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And most people really understood the,

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the issue and really understood what it means to have

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
your dogs in jail, basically.

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And the people really understood it donated quite generously,

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and that's so incredibly nice.

359
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And what it tells me is that,

360
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
hey, wait a minute, we have a business model.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We have an absolute fucking business model for podcasting.

362
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I know how to make other people money.

363
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's what I know.

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I know how to make those serious bitties money.

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I know how to make money for worthy causes.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's a real serious business model that we cannot overlook.

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And quite honestly, I'm pretty fucking proud.

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was sitting to Adam Curry show last week,

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the Tuesday show,

370
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and I was surprised to hear him play Battalica.

371
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Battalica are a band that take Battalica as a sort of a style,

372
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and then take the riffs and the backing music of the Beatles,

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
in this case it was, hey, Jude,

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and sort of mash them together.

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He introduced it as a mashup,

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
although mashups are usually working with a crawled at works.

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And in this case, I would call it more of a live mashup.

378
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I thought it'd be interesting to play a band that I know of in San Francisco,

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
called Smashup Derby, who are actually doing live mashups.

380
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They're doing these actually live,

381
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and actually playing events,

382
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
whereas Battalica, a very secretive,

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and friends I know only do recordings.

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So, here they are taking Franz Ferdinand,

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
mixing it with talking heads. I'll see what you think.

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
By the way, this is pretty fucked up, chef.

387
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But I think you're like it.

388
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is not my people house,

389
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000

make a good show,

423
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Too dramatic to jump

424
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,480
I'm back for a bit, let it get out

425
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Burn it down the house for a tight

426
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
We're doing the party cover, hold tight

427
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,480
We're in for a naps, you wear those

428
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Let us go to the party

429
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Burn it down the house

430
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,480
So we should keep your fact to pass

431
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,480
It's times for jumping over the board

432
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Trust me, tasty and secure

433
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Closing up but not too far

434
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Maybe you know as you are

435
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Fight your fire required

436
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Oh, hey, you might need a break down, shake down

437
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Keep up in rockin' light, free, hunt, train, stay by the breeze

438
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Burn it down out, not out, so I don't want to hear it

439
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Next life, don't wanna hurt them all, it's something sure

440
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Can't be me, all five feet

441
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Burn it down the house

442
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I don't wanna believe in you

443
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I know I won't believe in you

444
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I know I won't believe in you

445
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I know I won't believe in you

446
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
With you

447
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Same as it ever goes

448
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Burn it down the house

449
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Same as it ever goes

450
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Same as it ever goes

451
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Burn it down the house

452
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Same as it ever goes

453
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Same as it ever goes

454
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Burn it down the house

455
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
That was talking friends by SmashUp Derby

456
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Now if you want to find out more about SmashUp Derby

457
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,480
They have their websites, which is at www. SmashUp Derby.com

458
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480
That's Derby or the need Derby as in Derby and Joan

459
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Now I love that song, I love the idea of sort of mashing things

460
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
That were live, because so often I'm messing around in acid

461
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Or not on acid, I mean in acid the problem

462
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
And actually trying to get things to work

463
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
And you can do so much more with a real band

464
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,480
And of course Adrian and Matti C are both involved with

465
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
The club in San Francisco

466
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,480
So they're quite heavily involved in the bootleg scene

467
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,480
And it's really nice to sort of hear something that's sort of live

468
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
And something that's quite dynamic like that

469
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
And I would love to see them alive at some point

470
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Shit

471
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Let me just explain what happened

472
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Can you take this question there?

473
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Oh, cool

474
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
But I want that, I don't want a free mouse pad, I want my mouse

475
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
By mouse and Matt

476
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Okay, so I was so enthusiastic about that live mashup

477
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,480
That essentially in my entire cup of tea

478
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Spilled all over the desk, all over the Louis 14

479
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
The Louis Qatar's

480
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Shit

481
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,480
And Christina was nice enough to get me a big roll of paper towel

482
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,480
It didn't spill on the keyboard

483
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Fuck, all over the desk, all over the breakout box

484
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Over the mouse pad

485
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Christina

486
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Okay

487
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
All right

488
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Okay, so sometimes shit just sucks

489
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Let me see what can I do with like continue to clean up here

490
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Listen to the sports pod, okay?

491
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah, you'll enjoy that

492
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Oh, it's fun, who goes crazy

493
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Down goes crazy

494
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Oh, it's fun

495
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,480
I don't believe what I just thought

496
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Oh, it's fun

497
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
And check the ball

498
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
And check the ball

499
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Oh, it's fun

500
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
You believe in miracles

501
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Yeah

502
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Okay, we're going to the sports pod for Friday

503
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
December 2,000 and four

504

At these sports pod

514
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Okay, so basically I just wanted to give you a little

515
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Just a little bit of promo there about the sports pod

516
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
I didn't want to play the whole thing for you. Okay

517
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Hold on, let me just reset the microphone

518
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Okay, that's better

519
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
There we go

520
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Shoot

521
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
I hate that

522
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
So rocking, man

523
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,480
I was like totally jamming out to that mashup

524
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
And then it's like this huge cup

525
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
It's not like a little teensy weeny

526
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,480
You know, a little wanky tea cup

527
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
It's a big, I love my pony coffee cup

528
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
You know, and the whole thing

529
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
I just like, I think my headphone

530
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Wire caught on it or something

531
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, man, totally sucked

532
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Okay, you're still tuned into the daily source code

533
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Madam Curry coming to you from the United Kingdom

534
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
We're in Guildford

535
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
And it disclosed cottage location

536
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
And

537
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm still getting lots of email about

538
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,480
You know, UK culture and who invented what?

539
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Another email here from

540
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Let's see

541
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
I would this email come from

542
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Oh man, it's a long email

543
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
That's for sure

544
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Okay, well, can I even tell who the email is from

545
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,480
But the gist of the email is

546
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Inventors of the TV

547
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Remember we were talking about this on a previous source code

548
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Well, it's a tie

549
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Okay, Adam, you won't remember me

550
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
But I love when people start off the emails to me like that

551
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Adam, you won't remember me

552
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
However

553
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
Oh, a number of years ago

554
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
When you needed assistance with your power book

555
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
At Media Plaza

556
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,480
I was the new Mac headed American webmaster there

557
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Of course I remember

558
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,480
So whoever said that low-key barred was the inventor of the television

559
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Only told you part of the truth apparently

560
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
You see it's a little more complicated than that

561
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Barred invented a technique for television

562
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Referred to his mechanical television

563
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
And publicly display that in 1924

564
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Now what it is, it used huge hungs of wood

565
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,480
And a spinning disk kind of like a flat

566
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
Zoatrop to collect the image

567
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Oh, there's all kinds of links to this shit

568
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
So at the same time in 1923

569
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
In 1923

570
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
A first up towards electronic television

571
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Developed into today's cathode rate

572
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Toot patented in 1924

573
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
And he called it at the time

574
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
The kinoscope

575
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Meanwhile in 22 in the town of Rigby, Idaho

576
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Philo T. Farnsworth, the high school science teacher

577
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
With no history of electronics

578
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Engineering sketched his design

579
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
For electrical engineering

580
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Toot and the high school science teacher

581
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
With no history of electronics

582
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Engineering sketched his design

583
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
For electrical engineering

584
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Design for electronic television

585
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
The model we used today

586
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
So you've got to go through this email

587
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
It's in the podcast show notes

588
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,480
It's just it continues to bugle my mind

589
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
How you grow up

590
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Depending on where you grow up

591
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Thinking that certain people

592
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Usually of your own country, origin and culture

593
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Discovered certain things

594
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
And when you really get down to it

595
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
There seems to be some dispute about stuff

596
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Some people say, well

597
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Yeah, it depends on how you look at it

598
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
So check that out in the podcast show notes for today's

599
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
DailySource Code

600
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Which can find on dailySourcecode.com

601
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,480
Hey Adam, hope you're settled in at the Prairie Cottage

602
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Well, yeah kind of

603
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Patricia said yesterday

604
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
She said, we finally unpacked

605
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
It doesn't mean we're completely settled

606
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
But we're unpacked

607
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I just wanted to go and tell you a few things

608
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
One struggle comments

609
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Love in your show

610
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
You can work ass

611
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Maybe back in MTV

612
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Didn't see her for a while

613
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
And I'll get them not seen you now

614
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
But definitely hearing a loud and clear

615
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Thanks

616
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Number two

617
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I got a little behind on my podcasts

618
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
And so I thought I'd just listen to them

619
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Oh man, this sounds kind of crappy

620
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
What are you using?

621
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
On the plane ride

622
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Well, I was listening to one of your podcast

623
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
And it was you on a plane

624
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
On your way to Amsterdam

625
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
And that's where I was headed to

626
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Just a little funny deja vu

627
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
I guess that's the word for it

628
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
And number three

629
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I've seen one of you talking about

630
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,480
The idea of being able to do podcasts

631
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
From like your iPod

632
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Thought I'd let you know

633
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,480
That there is a non iPod alternative

634
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Okay

635
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Hard to I've played

636
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
Not like the little yups

637
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
It's the I River

638
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I HP

639
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
So

640
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
And I'm doing it from that

641
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Actually, I think I ordered one of those

642
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
And are you recording it on the on the I River?

643
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Damn

644
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
I hope it's

645
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I wonder what the is it like

646
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
32k or is it 64k?

647
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
You need to

648
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Wait, that maybe I can see that

649
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
From the info on the file

650
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Let's see

651
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Oh

652
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Data rate

653
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
4.8k

654
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Bites per second

655
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Ah

656
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Okay

657
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
That explains the quality

658
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
So

659
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
If you think it sounds like crap

660
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Maybe it's not good for you to use

661
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
But does have a digital

662
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
And a analog

663
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Lines and line out

664
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
It's pretty nice tool

665
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Okay, that's it

666
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Just wanted to go

667
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
And main point was

668
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Thank you for the killer cast

669
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Oh man

670
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Degadise

671
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
No, you don't have to thank me

672
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Thank you

673
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Boy or only

674
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Thank you all so very much

675
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,480
More on the source code now

676
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Um

677
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Let's listen to the latest Don and Drew

678
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Uh show

679
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
And a couple things

680
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
First of all, it turns out

681
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
They're banned in Finland

682
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Apparently

683
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Uh one or multiple

684
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Finish ISPs no longer

685
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Allow access to the Donandrew.com

686
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Man those fins, you know

687
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
There's there

688
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
They're so politically correct

689
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Don't try and show a nipple in Finland

690
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Either everybody

691
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
But Dons get really pissed about all this press

692
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
That they're getting

693
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
And basically, and this happens all the time

694
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
With people who are married

695
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
You know, they'll kind of

696
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Assume or presume

697
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Certainly the press will assume that you have

698
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Your husband's last name

699
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
So

700
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
So she's being quoted as

701
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Don Dunkus

702
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
So it's Drew

703
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Dunkus

704
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
And Don Miss Sally

705
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
And she's getting pissed

706
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
And we got to watch out, you know

707
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Journalists out there

708
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Because you know she's going to stop

709
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
She's getting into a half

710
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
And then you show a puff off

711
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
And she

712
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
And she won't want to do any more podcast

713
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
So we got to be careful

714
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Don Miss Sally

715
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
It's Don Miss Sally

716
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Everybody

717
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
And

718
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
There's something else that I don't

719
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Don't have a queue up for you

720
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
But there's something that Don says

721
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
In, uh, let's see

722
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
That is the December second podcast

723
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
So the Don and Drew show

724
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Where she says something

725
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
There's been haunting my mind

726
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
For the longest time

727
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Because it works

728
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
You know in order to stop smoking

729
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
And I'm talking about evil smoke

730
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Right cigarette smoke

731
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Let's just forget all other types of smoke

732
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
For the time being

733
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,480
You have to have some kind of incentive

734
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Death is a good one

735
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
That works for a lot of people

736
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
It's really hard to stay off smoking

737
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,480
And I guess for me

738
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
The worst part is

739
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
In the Netherlands

740
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
If you go by a

741
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Prefabricated split

742
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
They basically mix the

743
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Marijuana with tobacco

744
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
And that's not good

745
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
It tastes really good

746
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
I got to tell you that

747
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
It tastes wonderful

748
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
And I can dream about that

749
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
But I can't have it

750
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
I can't have it

751
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Because I'm an addict

752
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
I am a

753
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Nicotine addict

754
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
And if I have one of those

755
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Then I basically fall off the wagon

756
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
And then I want to smoke again

757
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
And Don said something to me

758
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
At a blogger con

759
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Hey, hon

760
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Hello

761
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Can I help you?

762
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,480
No, no, no

763
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,480
It only spilled on the Louis Cetsware desk

764
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Oh, shit

765
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
It did spill on the carpet

766
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Yes

767
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Fuck

768
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
It was this whole thing spilled

769
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
I'm sorry

770
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
I didn't even see it on that

771
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Yeah, that was a bonfire

772
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
It's just a little bit

773
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Will that come out?

774
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
A T

775
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
No, a T won't come

776
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
It's like pain

777
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
It's like pain

778
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Hold on

779
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
We can't hear you

780
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
We used to die

781
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Are underwear in there

782
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
In T

783
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
You're underwear?

784
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
Yeah, if you want to have sort of

785
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Well, who's going to see underwear?

786
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Skin collar underwear

787
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Well, sometimes you need it under

788
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Under something that's a little bit

789
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Yeah, see you

790
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
See you through

791
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
So you wear something

792
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Wait everybody

793
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Here's clothing tips from Patricia

794
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
You put it in the T

795
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Well

796
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
You can now wear my carpet

797
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
You can steep it a little bit

798
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
And then after we're afterwards

799
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
You got beautiful skin color

800
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Underwear

801
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
But it's not good on the carpet

802
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
No

803
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
No

804
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
That's not good

805
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
That's not going to come out

806
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Is it?

807
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
That's going to suck

808
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Ah

809
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
It's probably already in there

810
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Oh yeah, it's already leaking

811
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Down towards the very good

812
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I did a good job, huh?

813
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Yeah

814
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
I did a good job

815
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Stepping on it with my big boots

816
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
You know, and I was in the shower

817
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
I took a nice and relaxed shower

818
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I didn't do anything

819
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I didn't do anything

820
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
I didn't do anything

821
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
I didn't do anything

822
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
I didn't do anything

823
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I didn't do anything

824
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Nothing

825
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Nothing, dear

826
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Okay, thank you

827
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
I'll continue with my show now

828
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Love you, mean it

829
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Bye

830
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,480
So Dawn

831
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Let's get back to Dawn for a second

832
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
My other wife

833
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
She

834
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
She said something that haunted me

835
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
And it just works so well as an incentive

836
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
And I've been to Amsterdam in the meantime

837
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
She said

838
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Smoking cigarettes

839
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Smoking tobacco

840
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Is like sucking on

841
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The man's dick

842
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
The man being the man

843
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Not a man, but the man

844
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,480
And she says it again in that podcast

845
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
December 2nd podcast

846
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
I'm going to have to drag that up

847
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Because it's going to work for other people

848
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
I really will

849
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
When you hear the way she says it, it's just like

850
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Whoa, you know, and it makes so much sense

851
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Because totally, you know, like you're being addicted

852
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
And it's, you know, and it's

853
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
They're putting shit in there to keep you addicted

854
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,480
Okay, so anyway, just want to

855
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Just want to say hi to my other wife Dawn

856
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,480
And more helpful hints from around town

857
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
People trying to help me out

858
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
With my ADSL problems

859
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I actually posted it pretty long

860
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Outline of

861
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,480
What's gone wrong and what my options are

862
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
And it will get fixed obviously, but it's just

863
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
It's a pain, you know, two weeks without

864
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Any type of real connectivity sucks

865
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
People who have been there can feel my pain

866
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
But I got a great comment

867
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Again on the podcast show notes

868
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Here's all you have to do

869
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Step one, get a shovel

870
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Step two, dig around until you find a trunk line

871
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
Step three, tap into the green blue yellow

872
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
And move white stripe wires

873
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Number four, run those to an RJ 45

874
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,480
On pins 1, 2, 3, 6

875
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,480
And then plug into your switch

876
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Plug into your switch in the house

877
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,480
And then cover everything with dirt

878
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Maybe a couple of ferns

879
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
And you're good to go

880
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm like, uh-huh

881
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Yeah, I want to dry that

882
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Seriously, there are some of those options

883
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
That are pretty similar, there's the SDSL

884
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I mean, I'm getting a real education

885
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Different ways you can get connected to the internet

886
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,480
When I'm hoping most will happen

887
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Just for a short interim is this WDSL

888
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Which is wireless DSL

889
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Which is should be hearing about today

890
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
So perhaps more on the podcast tomorrow

891
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
And see a gaff

892
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Which means a fuck up on my part high Adam

893
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
Says Tim Biedle

894
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Really enjoying your show

895
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Especially your experiences adjusting to UK life

896
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
So many things we take for granted

897
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,480
And also I'm sorry I do that again

898
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
So many things we take for granted

899
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Take on new meaning when we see it through the eyes of a stranger

900
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
There you go

901
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Just one thing though

902
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,480
BBC SCR does not stand for South Coast radio

903
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,480
As I said, I was really in my American mode

904
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,480
I guess it stands for Southern Counties radio

905
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Love your cockney accent

906
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Better than Dick Van Dykes

907
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
I feel so incredibly special

908
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Time for another promo

909
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,480
If you have any promos that you want to air it on a daily source code

910
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Which basically just kind of promotes your podcast

911
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Happy to play them

912
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
The more creative, the better obviously

913
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
Just email them to atamercurry.com

914
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Hey podcast world, this is Greg

917
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,480

918
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
It's called Viva podcast

That's vivapodcast.com

922
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Adios

923
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Right on

924
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,480
The vivapodcast vivapodcast.com

925
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I don't know if you know who a peeper del is

926
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,480
Pete is actually the guy who I think I don't

927
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
And Drew started on podcasting

928
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
It's all his fault

929
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,480
He responded to the guardian article

930
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Actually he talked about a lot about

931
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
I call him produce Pete now

932
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
About how he cooks

933
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
A lot of people took this article to heart

934
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
They were really thinking about

935
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
What are we stuffing into our face these days

936
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
And what are we eating and where is it coming from

937
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,480
And how is it being produced and how is it being processed

938
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,480
And shoot, it's kind of scary

939
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Just food is basic

940
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
If we can get past this idea of putting

941
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Burning tobacco in our face

942
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
We should certainly look at

943
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
At all the other things we stuff in there

944
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Dawn

945
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
No, what I mean girl

946
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Here's Pete with the rastery body

947
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,480
This is rastery body of four

948
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
2004

949
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Well, oh two

950
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,480
So why did the British guy

951
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Bring two of hookers into his robot

952
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Someone told him he needed a pair of arms

953
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
He said

954
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Thank you

955
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
And good night

956
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
People are living

957
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Rastery body

958
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
That is the show for December 2nd 2004

959
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
This is the daily source code

960
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm out of curry coming to you from the curry cottage in the UK and lovely

961
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Guildford and sorry

962
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
And not far from here

963
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Todd Maffin was in Berlin

964
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Looking for the Berlin Wall

965
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
I've got to play a bit of this because this is like the tower of

966
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Where

967
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
And you have to listen to this whole thing

968
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
I've put a link to the show

969
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Well, just listen to a bit of it

970
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
And then we'll explain what happens

971
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Hi, I'm Todd Maffin

972
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Thanks for tuning into the iLoveReadyow.org podcast

973
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Today we are coming to you from Berlin Germany

974
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
And my goal today is to find

975
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
The Wall

976
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Or what's left of the Berlin Wall anyway

977
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Which I understand is not very much

978
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
But I'm

979
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Basically in the wander around the streets

980
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
The Concierge is pointed me toward the right

981
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Which

982
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Good as the instructions as he was able to give me

983
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,480
So I'm going to walk along here and

984
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Follow along as we try and find the wall

985
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
So besides I'm the kick-in

986
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
John Lymus

987
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
He listened to the cab driver

988
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
I think this is it

989
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Oh, who is this English?

990
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
We're going to terminate

991
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Do you speak English?

992
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Hello

993
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Do you speak English?

994
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
No, but I'm going to kick your ass

995
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
You fucking American

996
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Can you tell me how to find the wall?

997
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
I wonder if did the

998
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Todd, you have to let us know

999
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
Did you have like a big fucking microphone while you're doing this?

1000
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Hi, I'm a fucking American tourist

1001
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Do you know where the fucking wall is?

1002
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
The wall, what's left of the wall?

1003
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
The wall? What's left of the wall?

1004
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
The wall?

1005
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
It's not here.

1006
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay, we're in food

1007
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
And

1008
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
You see the mirror?

1009
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Is he the mirror right here?

1010
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,480
He's 50 meters here

1011
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,480
How many euros is that for you to take me?

1012
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
Okay, now this is the beautiful part

1013
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
The cab driver says

1014
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
And I'm good at this

1015
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Because I've lived in Europe

1016
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Most of my life

1017
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
The cab driver is having a real hard time explaining

1018
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,480
But he's saying it's only like 50 meters from here

1019
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
And Todd says, how many euros will it cost to get me there?

1020
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Now, 50 meters is about, you know, 55 yards

1021
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Basically

1022
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,480
So this whole podcast and you have to listen to this

1023
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Because it's hilarious

1024
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
And I can just imagine him walking around

1025
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
With this big ass microphone

1026
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Asking people where the wall are

1027
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
And they're like, oh, the fucker

1028
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
It's like right there

1029
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
That's where it was

1030
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
So of course he finds out

1031
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
In the end that he really only had to walk

1032
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Like, you know, half a football field to get there

1033
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
But an excellent podcast

1034
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
And I'm considering moving

1035
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
I love radio

1036
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
The podcast into the comedy section

1037
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Because it's just really, really good

1038
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
All right, time for some free music

1039
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,480
This, let's see, I played

1040
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Something a while ago

1041
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,480
From, let's see, what was it?

1042
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
From chosen

1043
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I think it was chosen

1044
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,480
And I got a whole email

1045
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Going on with

1046
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,480
The manager

1047
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Or the actually the management and marketing guy

1048
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Who does this for these bands

1049
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
And you just have to read the email

1050
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
To get all the background on it

1051
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Sent me another song

1052
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
And I think this is the right one

1053
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I don't know if I have the right track queue

1054
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm so frazzled now with all this tea

1055
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Spilling all over the carpet

1056
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Here's a track from

1057
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Remained to one, our artist

1058
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
He says, let me know what you think

1059
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
The track is called I Candy

1060
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I was blessed with an angel from the heavens above

1061
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
But like cooling a gang

1062
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I cherished the love

1063
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
I thought the grass was green

1064
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
We was like Rick James and Tina

1065
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
So we let things come between us

1066
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Look how you ended it

1067
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Little friends were friends better fits

1068
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
So chill west was so innocent

1069
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
I ain't going shed no tears

1070
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Can't get my money back on top

1071
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Spin all those years

1072
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Wasn't home all the time

1073
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
But always there

1074
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Not a picture that you painted

1075
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
It's crystal clear

1076
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
Same looks as deceiving

1077
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
You left without a reason

1078
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Quickly change like the season

1079
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Now I'm still breathing

1080
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
You can't break me

1081
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
You'll make me never do things

1082
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Was they shaky

1083
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,480
Clear the take me quite some time

1084
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,480
Cause everybody knows how I can find

1085
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,480
I want nothing fancy

1086
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Just a piece of eye candy

1087
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Can I get a glimpse of that

1088
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
I'll kiss you Spanish

1089
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
Wait a black just one

1090
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
He said, I can't

1091
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
I want nothing fancy

1092
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Just a piece of eye candy

1093
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
Can I get a glimpse of that

1094
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480
I'll kiss you Spanish

1095
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Wait a black

1096
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Just one little taste of that

1097
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
I can't

1098
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
What would it not give for

1099
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
One more taste

1100
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
One more shot

1101
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
I'm talking about

1102
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
One more chase

1103
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
And I ain't blind

1104
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
Could up on your lies

1105
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
How you should grow

1106
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Friends is you have the boss

1107
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,480
Which we could go to distance

1108
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,480
To get chance to try to listen

1109
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Now we knocked out a position

1110
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
My heart would lower you

1111
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
You was just for you

1112
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Get some stuff into

1113
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
That's why I never told you

1114
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Don't let this damn me

1115
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
I can't be

1116
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
We could have both been a family

1117
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
I'm not sure what's going on

1118
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
I'm going to let you play

1119
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,480
For another time

1120
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
It keeps crapping out

1121
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
That's no good

1122
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
I don't know what's up with that

1123
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,480
I've heard that her up on a couple of times

1124
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Was it with MP3's

1125
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Okay

1126
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
I can't you will get to that

1127
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
Another time in the source code

1128
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Hope you didn't put the automatic

1129
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Three minutes skip in there

1130
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Because now you probably missed this

1131
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Bit and you're already off into

1132
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Something else

1133
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
I got to remember

1134
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
What was this?

1135
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Was this the last Starbucks podcast

1136
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
I guess that must have been

1137
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Must have been Fridays

1138
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,480
I was trying to get a hold of Lee Wilkins

1139
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Wilkins to talk about his dogs

1140
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,480
And I was looking for some

1141
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,480
Dialing music and I just basically hit the first thing

1142
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
That came up in iTunes

1143
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
And it was a king of the road

1144
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
By was it Roger Miller

1145
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,480
And I came up with this

1146
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
With a little lyric

1147
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Which was Prince of the pod

1148
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
And of course you got to figure

1149
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Someone wrote lyrics to it

1150
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Kim Black did a great job

1151
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
She says

1152
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,480
I'm no songwriter

1153
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,480
But here it is

1154
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,480
And and I for a long time I thought

1155
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
You know what I'm going to do with this

1156
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
I should maybe I should

1157
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Maybe I should try and do something

1158
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,480
Do a song

1159
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Patricia hates it when I sing

1160
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
And she's right

1161
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Because you know it's like I can't sing

1162
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
I really cannot sing

1163
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,480
I suck at singing

1164
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
And if you really do know how to sing

1165
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Like she does then

1166
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
You know that's like painful

1167
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
And by the way I think most

1168
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
These jockeys

1169
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Really are frustrated singers

1170
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Or performers

1171
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,480
And whenever

1172
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,480
You'll notice this

1173
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
Whenever DJs

1174
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,480
Radio DJs

1175
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,480
Have a chance

1176
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
To sing

1177
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
They jump right in boy

1178
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
They love singing

1179
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
And I have to admit

1180
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,480
I have some of that

1181
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,480
Not what's not a frustration

1182
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
But I don't know what to do

1183
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
I think

1184
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Most of it's just the whole process

1185
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,480
Of putting a song together

1186
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
That is fascinating

1187
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Because when you're DJ

1188
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
You're already into sound

1189
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
You're into

1190
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Into mixing boards

1191
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
You're into

1192
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
You know just put

1193
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Really your it's in life

1194
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,480
It's performance art

1195
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
It's just what podcasting is

1196
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
So

1197
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,480
When I saw the lyrics

1198
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
I said well you know all I really need

1199
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
And I have garage band

1200
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,480
And you know I should be able to

1201
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,480
I thought no I can't do that

1202
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
Because I don't know how to

1203
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Fucking play

1204
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Yeah

1205
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
I studied piano for two years

1206
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,480
But no way

1207
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
Am I going to be able to

1208
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
Even figure out how to do

1209
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,480
King of the Road

1210
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,480
By the way the piano

1211
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,480
Was still sitting in the empty castle

1212
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,480
Life

1213
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,480
If you want a piano

1214
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Let me know

1215
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,480
I need to sell it

1216
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,480
Or I have to send it somewhere

1217
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,480
Within two weeks

1218
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
So it's going to be safe

1219
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
Anyway so

1220
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,480
Why not

1221
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
And Google for

1222
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
For a MIDI version of King of the Road

1223
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,480
And I actually found something

1224
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,480
That was

1225
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
Let me see

1226
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,480
Sequenced

1227
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,480
By

1228
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
Here comes

1229
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
I'm playing for you now

1230
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,480
Harry Todd

1231
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
I put a link to these original

1232
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,480
Page in there as well

1233
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
And I listen to this

1234
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
So yeah

1235
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,480
That's kind of like

1236
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
Harps Accord

1237
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Like

1238
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
I like that

1239
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
If I'm going to do this

1240
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
I'm going to do it right

1241
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
Now what I found is

1242
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,480
There's a way to

1243
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,480
Take a MIDI file

1244
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
And through another little program

1245
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,480
Which I forget what it's called

1246
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,480
Montemedi

1247
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Something like that

1248
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
Montemedi

1249
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
I mean you could just

1250
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
Search Google for

1251
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Import MIDI into Garage Band

1252
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
Because Garage Band

1253
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
Doesn't do it natively

1254
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
For some reason

1255
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,480
So you take this MIDI file

1256
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Drag it onto this application

1257
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
And it does all kinds of magic

1258
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
And it creates a folder for you

1259
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
And in that folder

1260
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,480
Is all the instruments in separate files

1261
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,480
And you drag that into a Garage Band

1262
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,480
Song and new project

1263
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
And low and behold

1264
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
It gives you all these tracks

1265
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
In this case it had like ten tracks

1266
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
And it gave me the opportunity

1267
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,480
To then go and select

1268
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Different instruments

1269
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
Because I wanted to

1270
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
I already had the score

1271
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,480
Right

1272
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
But I needed

1273
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,480
I just needed a little more

1274
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
And just some kick and stuff

1275
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,480
A little heavier bass

1276
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
And some guitars in there

1277
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
And I'll shut up

1278
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,480
And you know

1279
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Well, see for yourself

1280
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Cast your phone

1281
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,480
See your rent

1282
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Cut it just left

1283
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
For 50 cents

1284
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
No Wi-Fi

1285
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,480
And almost no mess

1286
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,480
And John

1287
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Look, girl

1288
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,480
No cigarettes

1289
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,480
So that

1290
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
Two hours of

1291
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
And whatever money

1292
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Makes me a podcast

1293
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,480
The personality of a man

1294
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,480
A means by no means

1295
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,480
Friends of the park

1296
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,480
Podcasting

1297
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,480
Not show

1298
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,480
Destination

1299
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,480
How the hell should I?

1300
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Don't go now

1301
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,480
For the jokes

1302
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,480
I'm paying my empty views

1303
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,480
I smoke

1304
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,480
All sinkies

1305
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,480
A one or two

1306
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,480
If I can quit

1307
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,480
Hey, boy

1308
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,480

My enemies

1311
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
By no means

1312
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480

00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,480
And...

1367
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,480
Anyone

1368
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,840
They

1369
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,480
And on Christmas

1370
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,480
Andboy

1371
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:39,280
Two hours of head to the weather up all night. It makes me a podcast of personality

1372
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:55,160
Okay, Prince of the Pod, everybody. This will never air again and no, I'm not going to put up an MP3

1373
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,400
No

1374
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,260
Just did it because people were so nice to do the lyrics and

1375
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,140
And basically so nice to put a MIDI file up there and share and so I thought I'd share something back. Don't you love it?

1376
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,420
Good and interesting comment came in from Bill Kennedy from

1377
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,180
Indianapolis who of course followed the Lee will Lee and Jenny

1378
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:22,620
Story of their of their two, you know, they're two beautiful little doggies who have been caught up in the airline and quarantine

1379
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,660
Hell and he had an interesting idea. I said

1380
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,540
Couldn't a podcast listener in Atlanta get the dogs out of the kennel hold them for

1381
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,060
For Lee and Jenny until they get all the money

1382
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
To get them back to United Kingdom

1383
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:45,260
In fact, they also could you know if they could find like a really good you have family

1384
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,620
Because he has the way it works basically you have to the animals have to have a rabies shot

1385
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:55,340
Forget all the other stuff the passport and the chip and the neck but they have a rabies shot and then they have to wait for

1386
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,980
Six months before they can enter the United Kingdom. So six months after the rabies shot

1387
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,740
I presume they've probably had that rabies shot by now and they've probably so it's about like a week or two

1388
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,620
Maybe just a full week

1389
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,420
But they would have to stay in the states for another six months. Maybe there's a really great family who would want to

1390
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,620
You know take care of them instead of

1391
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,900
Bring them over to the United Kingdom and curing huge costs. I think it's for two dogs

1392
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:29,420
It'll probably be about five thousand dollars for the six months. They have to stay in quarantine. I'm not kidding you about this

1393
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:36,540
And you know sure you can visit them, but they're basically in jail. You know, so it's just a thought anyway

1394
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:42,540
But again really cool that everyone has helping out on at least getting something going and getting it back

1395
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,860
to the UK

1396
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,860
If it all possible within the next way have another ten days to go or something

1397
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,220
Another email I wanted to share with you. Hi Adam. I've been listening to the daily source code for a few weeks

1398
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,220
I've been following the growth of podcasting

1399
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:01,420
My addiction to podcast will have to stop cold turkey for a while since I was strong armed and my

1400
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:08,140
iPod was stolen this evening while yes, indeed listening to your star-bucky and Skype adventures on the daily source code

1401
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:15,340
Incidentally says this occurred on a quiet street in Residential Menlo Park about two miles away from the blogger

1402
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,620
on three location at Stanford University. This is freaking me out

1403
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,780
It goes into explaining exactly how this happened. This is will by the way

1404
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,820
And it's horrible. He was walking along with his iPod

1405
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,620
He said actually a realize later must have been following me because I was unaware

1406
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:43,900
And couldn't hear anything over the exciting beat of the rockman enough, which of course is the power of your intellect

1407
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:51,100
And they basically grabbed the iPod ripped you know ripped it right off of right off of them

1408
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,460
Kind of ripping the headphones out and boom took off with that. So, you know

1409
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,820
Menlo Park

1410
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,660
Sox

1411
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,100
Sorry about that dude. I'm really sorry. Oh good news

1412
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,820
The new Jay Potter is out. Jay Potter is an iPod are variant. It's based on Java, so it works

1413
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,900
On anything that will run Java, at least that's the promise of Java, right?

1414
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,380
Couple of new features in that though, and the thing that I like the most is

1415
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,940
The vacation switch

1416
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,980
Oh, so I'm just trying to look at a different email here. I was talking about this

1417
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,020
On the source code. I might even post it something about it on on my weblog is

1418
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,900
When you have a loss of connection for a couple days. You could be on vacation or

1419
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:45,420
Like me you could be without bandwidth when you go to start you know syncing up with your shows

1420
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,020
iPod or is going to bring in everything. Every single iPod has done this to date

1421
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,300
It'll go and try and bring in every single show that that you've missed and what we need is some more

1422
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,100
Intelligent content management and Jay Potter as well as

1423
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:03,420
What is that the bottom feeder something that I found

1424
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,140
Through email

1425
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,900
Actually, it's on Apple's website Apple was had a link to it

1426
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,460
If then soft.com

1427
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,460
Also has this feature and you know, it's it's great to see that

1428
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:23,260
You know, we're we're helping me help and a brother out need who has like no fucking bandwidth

1429
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,900
What's this in the daily source code comment?

1430
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,900
What are we? We're like 55 minutes shoot. It's gonna be an hour long show

1431
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,060
That's for sure. Let's check out the comment

1432
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:42,060
Yeah, this is Kurt from Minnesota first off. Thank you for podcasting in the daily source code

1433
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,260
I really enjoyed listening to it well just about every day

1434
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:52,700
Right now I had downloaded it onto my i-book and I'm sitting in a car in a parking ramp in herndon Virginia

1435
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,220
And what you would talked about with regards to

1436
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,260
All nations which I'm like right please. Please tell me

1437
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,980
You have your pants on

1438
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,420
Rank true in my situation. I have no bandwidth during the day and then I've got great bandwidth at night

1439
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,100
And I thought would really be great as a feature instead of having you have a vacation switch

1440
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,020
Is have a bandwidth slider

1441
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:22,860
So you can slide it all over do. I've got nothing no net to I've got dial up in which case it'll prioritize what it downloads up to

1442
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,300
I've got my normal full net set up so just a thought

1443
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:34,220
I thought I'd voice it as a as a sound file here. I'm using garage band for the first time and it's kind of an interesting experience

1444
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,860
Turning off like the metronome and some other things, but anyway, it was just my thought up for a feature

1445
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:43,420
I thought that would be more useful than something that just toggles on and off for vacation

1446
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:50,540
Anyway again, thanks for daily source code and keep at it. It sounds great. Yeah, that's a good idea

1447
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,180
So that's actually a very good interface

1448
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:01,420
So oh, yeah, just say okay, right now I have X bandwidth and it's gonna make decisions based upon your bandwidth

1449
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,820
What to do that would be really cool. I don't know how you set it up if that's a

1450
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:11,180
Pre-determined matrix that we come up with or if that's something you can you should always be able to configure it yourself

1451
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,180
But good idea

1452
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,180
very cool very cool

1453
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,500
It's I was like he's sitting in this in the parking lot in the car

1454
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:25,020
You know, what is he doing there? Is he hijacking someone's Wi-Fi or jacking something else?

1455
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:31,260
You know, we got to get out of here. It's almost time it's almost an hour for this show and and I'm

1456
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,820
I have so much to do well tomorrow

1457
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,780
I already have tomorrow show almost planned and when I look at it this way

1458
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,140
I'm gonna leave you with a little piece that was sent to me by

1459
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,620
Well, I can't tell you who sent it to me because he basically broke the wall by sharing this with me

1460
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:52,220
And it's definitely I'm breaking the law too. I'm gonna play it play it for you. It's a classic

1461
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,140
I'm gonna end the show with this so don't wait for the rock money off power up your intellect

1462
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,500
I'm just gonna play the last minute of this song

1463
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:09,820
Please listen to the foresight that these genius musicians had and I what I mean songwriters producers musicians

1464
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:15,260
Genius when they wrote this and they recorded this they knew that one day

1465
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,420
podcasting would be for ever body
