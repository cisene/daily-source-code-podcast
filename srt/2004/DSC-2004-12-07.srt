00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Welcome once again to your daily source code. Today is Tuesday. It's, uh, man, December 7th, 2004

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,400
come to you from Curry College of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, of that island

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,520
off the mainland. It's your source code. This is of course being the official place

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,520
where users and developers attempt to party together, although it's getting harder to do.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,880
That's right. There's less drugs available here than in Belgium and

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,680
getting much much harder. Oh, man. Boy, if we've been through a lot in the past 24 hours,

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,840
it's, uh, I woke up this morning and the first thing I thought was right. Let's go find some

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,480
bandwidth. It's one of those things, you know. I like don't you wake up in the morning and think

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:14,320
bandwidth. So I immediately ran down my list as I was still in my bathroom,

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,880
but actually we got up a little bit late as usual. About 930, Patricia was already up and cooking, cooking

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,760
stuff in the kitchen, which was nice, especially that really unhealthy, really thick,

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:37,040
sliced English bacon. So I started calling, called over to Pipex to inquire about WDSL.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,560
Well, it looks like the service has been discontinued.

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,040
Then I called the Bulldog DSL. Guys got a real good wrap for providing 8 megabits per second.

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,400
Also, according to their availability checker, also available at the Guilford Exchange,

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,560
unfortunately, they're still running on British telecom equipment. And after, you know,

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
searching through my email and just looking at the latest stuff that had come in overnight,

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,720
I was turned on to easy net. Actually, I'd received a couple emails about it earlier,

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,640
and they only do business accounts. Luckily, I have a business, so I was able to set one up,

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,600
but really friendly. And all of a sudden, once I posted about easy net, and that's

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,400
easy net.co.uk. It's probably easy net.net. Then, you know, just everyone's spranging to action,

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,480
co-founders, XCTO systems engineers, everyone started emailing me, and everyone's going to, you know,

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,080
trying to help out is really, really cool. And so, you know, now I'm committed. I know that these

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
guys, they who have their own equipment at the Guilford Exchange, I know that they'll be able to hook

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
me up. Of course, it's still going to take an X amount of time for British telecom to basically

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,040
perform three keystrokes to relinquish my line over to easy net, so that they can then subsequently

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,760
hook up my DSL connection. Now, I had a couple of choices. And the top of the line choice,

28
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,920
which I can actually get here from easy net, you're going to love this, is an eight megabit down 725k

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,040
up DSL connection. I was like, oh, man, that could be my own fucking ISP. I could be every podcast

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,520
there's ISP with that kind of pipe. Actually, of course, it's, you know, that's the downlink,

31
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,520
that's really, that's really got all the pipe. And that was, after thinking about it, that's

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,080
really ridiculous. There's no need for that. And they have a second option, which is somewhat

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,200
less expensive. I'm still going to wind up paying Â£199 a month, but I will get four megabit

34
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,200
down 725k up, which is pretty astounding. You don't get that kind of speed up almost DSL connections.

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,560
So, it'll be great for posting podcasts and getting stuff out there. Five static IP addresses,

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,320
the whole thing. So, we'll still have to wait until BT switches over the line, so they can then

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,720
take care of it. But at least those guys got ports and everyone's working on it. And I want to thank

38
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,600
you so much. It's so cool that everyone jumped in. And even if I have to wait two more weeks,

39
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,680
you know, I already feel good knowing that it's going to be great. And I'm going to have a great

40
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,280
bandwidth. And I'm using my various iPoders. I'm actually, this has been a great opportunity

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,480
for me to test out different iPod or software, since iPod or X, which I've been using,

42
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,160
doesn't have what I call the vacation switch, basically. There comes a point where you don't

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,480
have bandwidth. You've got to catch up on your podcasts. And it's a pain if you have to,

44
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,080
you know, if you're downloading three podcasts per channel. It's just only so much time in the

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,200
day if you have only a few moments to connect to a pipe. This is all content management stuff

46
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
that we're going to have to start figuring out with iPoders eventually. I probably just have

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,480
the first person to really bump into it. Actually, as you'll hear later on on the show, I'm not the

48
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,320
first person to run into trouble with bandwidth on the receiving end and missing a couple of

49
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,560
shows and then basically trying to catch up. There are more people who've had the problem and more

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,440
who are coming up with the different solutions. And I just haven't had enough time to check out

51
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,880
all my email. I did see that my boyfriend drew, no, and from the dawn and drew show, sent me an email,

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:23,600
and it turns out that he's, he's into drums as much as I am. I've only discovered that I kind of

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,760
like, you know, drums, the drum cadence. So this is the Michigan drum cadence, by the way,

54
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,040
that I'm playing as a repeat. I just, I don't know, it kind of does it for me. I like it. You know,

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,480
and now, of course, people are sending me drum cadences from all over the country, which probably

56
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:49,200
would warrant a podcast all by itself. Any takers? I've been not played too much of that because,

57
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,840
you know, drums can get, get all jealous and shit. You can't have that. Also, wasn't touched with

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,520
Lee Wilkins, of course, we know Lee and his girlfriend, Jenny, they're two cute little doggies are

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,760
locked up in jail in Atlanta, and I had reached out to the source code listening community and

60
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,200
asked for you guys to help out. As of this morning, when, when he called me,

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:27,120
guess what? Already $1,200. So I, the clearly, they're going to make the 1,500, and thank you again

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,800
for, yeah, for helping them out, because that's, that's very cool. Just the fact that we could do it,

63
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,520
blows me away. It's, it's, you know, it really just shows what, something's going on here. There's

64
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,760
something working with his podcast. Okay, so that's enough drum cadence there. That was,

65
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,320
that was especially for, for Drew from Don Drew. And you know, it's, it's starting to itch.

66
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm, I'm getting a real itch now, you know. I still have to wait for the bandwidth, excuse me.

67
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,320
I still have to wait for the bandwidth to come in, because I've kind of promised myself that was

68
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,000
going to be the focus. But after that boy, I got to start flying. I am itching to fly. I hear

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,520
these helicopters going by by the house. Not that I necessarily want to, I mean, I should do an hour

70
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,720
to, in a helicopter just to, you know, just to keep the feel going and, and find a flying buddy,

71
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,560
basically. But I really want to get my fixed wing license so that it'll be much easier to fly over to

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,280
the mainland, basically go anywhere I want. And quite honestly, I've gotten the airplane flying bug.

73
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,840
I thought I would never want to fly anything other than helicopters. But after, what have I

74
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:42,080
done about 12, 15 hours in a, in a Session of 172? And as you know, I've done an hour or two in,

75
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,600
in a mooney, you know, all of a sudden, it's like, whoa, you know, this is, this is cool, because

76
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,760
in an airplane when you take off, first of all, the thing wants to fucking fly. I mean, all you

77
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,880
have to do, you know, metal to metal, you're pushing the throttle all the way against the dashboard,

78
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,040
basically. And then you wait for the airspeed indicator to hit the right, the right number,

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,040
you just ease back and things up and flying. Helicopters like, no way. It wants to tip over immediately

80
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,160
and thrash about. It doesn't want to fly. So that's beautiful, you know, and you, you pull these things

81
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,960
up, you're in the air and then depending on what you got, you know, autopilot, you know, you

82
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,400
drink your morning coffee, you know, just kick back and navigate your way through. I am, of course,

83
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,760
oversimplifying it. Please don't get all pissed off. If you happen to be a pilot, because of course,

84
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,760
they know that simple. But it is, you definitely have more limbs free than when flying a helicopter,

85
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,320
and that's quite a luxury. I look forward to it. So there's black bush airport, which is only

86
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,080
15 minutes away from here. Black bush is spelled in the, the old English spelling, bush,

87
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,640
BU, S-H-E. And I think it's a cab air aviation that I'm going to go talk to. They do F-F-A-A.

88
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,880
F-A, sounds like an R-I-A thing. Federal aviation administration licenses. So basically I have a

89
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,600
US helicopter pilot's license, and they can help me get the out on for the fixed wing.

90
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,960
Because it isn't, you don't have to go through all of the motions that you have to go through

91
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,840
for your initial PPL. You know, you have your theoretical part. And that basically you don't have

92
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,800
to do over. In fact, the theory for helicopter is the exact same theory ends the same test for

93
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,680
for airplanes. So you already have all the, all the basic theory. But when it comes down to it,

94
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:43,440
it's all about experience. There's no substitute for experience. And I've been checking out a

95
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,000
couple of podcasts. You know that I'm a big proponent of short podcasts. And then I'm looking

96
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,400
for, like the, you know, we've got the skinny on sports. You've got the sports pod. You've got

97
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:06,800
ICM, real reviews. Raster web audio, of course, always good for a short podcast. And you know

98
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,040
that I'm a follower of religious broadcasters. I love watching religious broadcasters on television.

99
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,680
And I love listening to them on the radio. They have a message they want. And by the way,

100
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm a spiritual guy. So I'm not knocking any of this. I have a different way of believing in

101
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,640
something else that I may believe in. But it's irrelevant. We're all communicating a message here.

102
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,320
And if you look at the religion node in the ipodder.org directory, it's got some, some good podcast

103
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,680
in there. And some new came in that I don't know if I've talked about this before or not.

104
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,920
But it's from, it's the godcast, basically godcast.org. And they bring you the living word. And

105
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,240
basically it's a passage from the Bible every day. And what I do as I figure, you know, it won't

106
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,640
hurt to listen to a little bit of a little bit of the Bible here. Listen, this is actually a

107
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Matthew 22. What I'll do is I'll spice it up a bit with the, with the Michigan drum cadence.

108
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Hi, this is Rachel Patrick from godcast.org. The little more from Monday December,

109
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:20,080
August 2004. Our verses for today are Matthew chapter 22, verses 37 to 40. And the translation

110
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,640
is the NIV. This is Jesus speaking to the teachers of the law.

111
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,320
Jesus replied, love the Lord you're God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your

112
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:40,400
mind. This is the first and greatest human in the second is like it. Love your neighbor at your

113
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:51,360
son. All the law on the prophets and on these two remains. Matthew chapter 22, verses 37 to 40.

114
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,880
Thanks for listening to the living word. Currents and verse requests are always welcome.

115
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,760
I feed back at godcast.org. This is Rachel Patrick hoping that God would truly bless and so

116
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,000
I was in a cute hole. Let me see that last bit. That was beautiful. Hold on, listen to the last bit

117
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,040
of her. Oh, that was really nice. I just don't want to play the drums through that. Check it out.

118
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,400
Godcast.org. This is Rachel Patrick hoping that God would truly bless and so your day. See you tomorrow.

119
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,680
See you tomorrow, Rachel. In a cute, that's beautiful. It really is. A little sappy on the music,

120
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,440
but very, very powerful way of communicating with kids. It works every time.

121
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,720
Okay, an email that came in. Hey, Adam, just finished a new intro from my weekly show podcast.

122
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,200
And I've paid, well, he says, human, but I'm sure he meets homage to you and your

123
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,000
point on annoying. I hope you approve. A lot of people last me, people are just tuning into podcast.

124
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:04,560
Where's this Boeing thing coming from? And it was Christina, who reminded me that it

125
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,600
actually came from watching the simple life with the Paris Hilton Nicole Richie because even though

126
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,720
it's a reality show, it's not really a reality show because it's edited together and everything's

127
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
kind of set up, but it doesn't matter. But whenever they do something weird that have sound effects

128
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,520
going point, be repeat. And then, you know, whenever Paris inevitably had to shove her hand up

129
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,000
a cow's ass, you know, you'd hear boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.

130
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,920
Hi, everybody. Okay, up there is.

131
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:58,880
Help, up here, here, here are what you ready to ask!

132
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:28,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

133
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:39,060
no, you just a horn in joy without enzyme acid, or more than ã¡, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

134
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,340
You're retritzing me when you hope you're really life.

135
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:52,020
What you should just walk in and chill.

136
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,420
It was a promo.

137
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
It will send me promos to their own podcasts.

138
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,420
What are you doing?

139
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
What are you doing?

140
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
What are you doing?

141
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,420
What are you doing?

142
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Come on to my microphone, baby.

143
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
What are you doing?

144
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
What are you doing?

145
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Do you know where the other microphone is?

146
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,420
No.

147
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
I can't find it.

148
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
I have the wire of everything because I want you to...

149
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
If you walk in or anyone walks in, I want you to have a mic.

150
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Oh yeah, you say have that one.

151
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
It's the grey one.

152
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
It's the 421.

153
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
It's a classic microphone.

154
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
What did I use to sing through?

155
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
What did I use to sing through?

156
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
What did I use to sing through?

157
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I haven't washed it.

158
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Really?

159
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Since you were seven.

160
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
It's a lipstick.

161
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Hmm.

162
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Okay, so Patricia's walked in and showed me her arms which are black and blue.

163
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Yeah.

164
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
What happened?

165
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
My upper arms.

166
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Your upper arms.

167
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
Have you been...

168
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
As your husband been being you.

169
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Are your boyfriend?

170
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
No.

171
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Nobody's beating me.

172
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
Your boyfriend's pretty cool though.

173
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,420
He's hanging up paintings and mirrors and he's...

174
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Is he?

175
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,420
And he's drilling holes in the rental house

176
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
that we're not supposed to be drilling holes in.

177
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
He's pretty handy, isn't he?

178
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Pretty handy.

179
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
You should give him sex once you lie.

180
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
I knew that, but you just always...

181
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
What?

182
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
What?

183
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,420
What?

184
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
What?

185
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
But you always say I can do that.

186
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,420
I pay people to do that.

187
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Yeah, I used to.

188
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
But you know...

189
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Before we downshift.

190
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
Now I notice that you can.

191
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
You're actually pretty...

192
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Don't tell anyone.

193
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
Because then Donald makes me fix up her crappy house.

194
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
Oh, no.

195
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Oh, don't do that.

196
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
What's happened?

197
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,420
This house is in 1930's house.

198
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
And it has silly doors.

199
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,420
With very high handles.

200
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Door handles.

201
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,420
And I walk into them all the time.

202
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
But you...

203
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
I'm a tiny little girl.

204
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Yeah.

205
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
But how can we...

206
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Walk into door handles before?

207
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
I know.

208
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
The doors are narrow.

209
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I know.

210
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Not that I'm fat or anything, you know.

211
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Well, you didn't put on a way honey.

212
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
No, nothing.

213
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,420
I'm very skinny, actually.

214
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Yeah, the doors are strange.

215
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
I don't know what it is.

216
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
But...

217
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
Can you stop walking in the doors?

218
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
And I'm tired.

219
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,420
So I'm wobbling a little bit.

220
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
Yeah, you're tired.

221
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
From one side to another.

222
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
And I...

223
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
I'm bumping into them.

224
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
I don't know what it is.

225
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
But it looks horrible.

226
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
Both arms are black and blue.

227
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Like you're...

228
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
You're nipping your bump.

229
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
Oh, you're hitting me all the time.

230
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
It's like a white Tina Turner.

231
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
Oh, I got it.

232
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
I'm going to finish up the show.

233
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Hold on a sec.

234
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
There we go.

235
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
A little reset.

236
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Thanks, son.

237
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
See you later.

238
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Love you.

239
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Me neither.

240
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah, love you too.

241
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,420
I don't know if we talked about this.

242
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,420
But there was a lovely woman from audible.com

243
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
who was at BloggerCon.

244
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,420
And Dave and I met with her after BloggerCon.

245
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
And we probably talked to her for about...

246
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,420
A good hour and a half or so about what podcast

247
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,420
and can do for audible.

248
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,420
And then we're both customers of audible.

249
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,420
And we talked about what we liked and we disliked about audible.

250
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
And we're...

251
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,420
You know, I was saying where the fuck is the Oprah Book Club podcast?

252
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
That's what I'm looking for, you know?

253
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
And shit, you know, I was basically saying,

254
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
hire me to do it.

255
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
I wasn't really saying that, but, you know,

256
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
I was as a figure of speech.

257
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,420
I was like, so clear that this is what they need to do.

258
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,420
And it's just not easy moving organizations around.

259
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,420
They're located in Wayne, New Jersey, which I know Wayne very well, by the way.

260
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Is that any of the Willowbrook Mall?

261
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Think, Wayne?

262
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Regardless of that.

263
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,420
It's interesting that today I should receive a...

264
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Actually, it's the full podcast.

265
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,420
I'll just play a little bit of the beginning.

266
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,420
It's from audible in Germany, audible.de.

267
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
And guess what?

268
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
They're doing a podcast.

269
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,420
audible, clever lesen.

270
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,420
The time.

271
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
The time.

272
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
The time.

273
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
The time.

274
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,420
The time.

275
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,420
The time.

276
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
The time.

277
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,420
From 1411 to 2004.

278
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Yeah, coming with the guy.

279
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
The time.

280
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
The time.

281
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,420
The time.

282
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
All man.

283
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I hope no one understands German.

284
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Listen to this show.

285
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Okay.

286
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,420
So that's the audible.de podcast.

287
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Isn't that cool?

288
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
So one of two things will happen.

289
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
Either A.

290
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
This will catch on.

291
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,420
And audible will start doing book clubs and podcasts all over the place.

292
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Or B.

293
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,420
It probably just is likely to happen.

294
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Headquarters is going to fucking freak out and tell them to stop immediately because this was not sanctioned.

295
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,420
This is not how we do business.

296
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
And now an audio comment from Ben.

297
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Which I haven't listened to yet.

298
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
So God knows.

299
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Hi there Adam.

300
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,420
It's a fun time Ben over from tracks of the tree.

301
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Hey, fun time with my first audio comment to your website.

302
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,420
I just want to say as it is customary to say.

303
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
Yeah.

304
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
I really enjoy the podcast.

305
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,420
And I'm listening since show 10.

306
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,420
And I can't go a day.

307
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I'm just, you know, it's a figurative thing.

308
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,420
When you go a day or can't you go a day without?

309
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,420
I was listening to your podcast from November 30th.

310
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,420
And then reminded again on the first of December podcast.

311
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:28,420
When you said that you wish that I potter or I potter acts or whatever program had a button that you could press,

312
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,420
which you would only download that the podcasts that you want after going on vacation.

313
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Actually, I want to update that situation.

314
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,420
I found what I find.

315
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,420
I found a new program called Play Pod.

316
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
It's for OS 10.

317
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
Actually, some Apple site.

318
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Was that next to Potom feeder?

319
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,420
I mean, I'm finding all these new OS X.

320
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
I pot variance.

321
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,420
The play pod actually has some of the features that I was looking for.

322
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
And I've been, I've been testing it.

323
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Or whatnot.

324
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Well, I can't give you that right away.

325
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:12,420
What I can offer you is a way to do the same thing without buying or changing any software.

326
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,420
You have everything you need right in front of you.

327
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,420
Are you ready?

328
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Oh, my goodness.

329
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
Oh, my goodness.

330
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Down a business.

331
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,420
So what you need is iTunes.

332
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
Got it.

333
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Pretty.

334
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
It's actually pretty simple.

335
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,420
What you do is you open up your new podcast dynamic playlist.

336
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,420
Do you remember the new podcast dynamic playlist?

337
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,420
We set up way back when in the early days of podcast.

338
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Oh, I'm going to think way back.

339
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Yeah, I remember.

340
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Basically, the rules for the new podcast or anyone who doesn't have a new podcast.

341
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,420
Okay.

342
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,420
I was like running now.

343
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,420
I was like, Ben's got it wrong.

344
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,420
That's only if you can download everything.

345
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Then, of course, it's different, you know, different challenge.

346
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
And then you can indeed use iTunes.

347
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
What you're explaining basically is content management.

348
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,420
And that's the thing that we don't have running quite yet in any of the iPodders that

349
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
I've seen.

350
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Let's just, and I, and Ron Bloom, who Dave and I have been talking to as a, he's a, he's a great business guy.

351
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I got to tell you a story about Ron.

352
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Not today.

353
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
I got to another time.

354
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
Actually, I have to tell the story when I'm with Ron.

355
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Otherwise, he can't provide any role model, but doesn't matter.

356
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,420
It's, for a business standpoint, if you say anything is like the TV of anything.

357
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:41,420
It's not really a good idea because TV, although a big hit with consumers has not been

358
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:51,420
in the success that, that was thought, that it might, that the potential was projected to be.

359
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Let's put it that way.

360
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,420
And of course, the reason is because the content is limited.

361
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,420
The content is limited to the people who own the fucking products, which is basically the television networks.

362
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:08,420
But the TV of podcasts and the TV of radio, when it comes to the actual functionality,

363
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,420
is so right on, you know, and what does TV do very well.

364
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
It does content management.

365
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
It makes decisions for you.

366
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
And it looks at the size of your hard drive.

367
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
And it looks at all kinds of things.

368
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,420
And, and it starts to fill itself up based upon a rule set or a matrix.

369
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
And I think it's not simple, you know.

370
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,420
It's, it's a, basically, there's a, there's a lot that has to be done before, before you get that right.

371
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,420
And the number one thing is just when this shit get deleted.

372
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,420
I've been hovering around three gigabytes on my hard drive for the past, you know, month and a half.

373
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:46,420
Just, you know, deleting stuff and getting, you know, I've been the basic content management manager.

374
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,420
And that's what my computer should be doing for me.

375
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,420
I should, you know, I have a pretty simple set of rules.

376
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,420
You know, I rarely want to save anything.

377
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,420
If I do, I put it in a special place and save that.

378
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
And otherwise, get rid of shit when I have to.

379
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,420
And, or it's, make sure I've played it.

380
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
If I haven't, you know, alert me to it.

381
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
I mean, it's a real simple rule set.

382
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,420
But that's where a lot of the iPod or stuff is going to go eventually, I think.

383
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,420
So, so it's not, it's a, it's a different person.

384
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
What was the other thing the other day?

385
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,420
You know, just have a slider that basically, well, fuck it, that won't work either.

386
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,420
Yeah, you got to, you got to be able to make some, some really good content management decisions.

387
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,420
One that I made was to subscribe to the Willis effect.

388
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Oliver Willis, I met at the first blogger con.

389
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,420
And, great guy.

390
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,420
Very, very outspoken on his blog.

391
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,420
I forget what his day job is.

392
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:51,420
But man, once he discovered podcasting and he pinged me and he sent me a, he sent me a quick email saying,

393
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,420
Well, I don't know if you have bandwidth or time, but, you know, check out the podcast.

394
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,420
I've been listening to him podcast number three at this point.

395
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,420
And he takes on the media and it's, it's fun to listen to the Willis effect.

396
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,420
And that felt, it feeds into the, you know, the story that came out, that's coming out Monday morning,

397
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:15,420
about Pat Delman, you know, God bless the sacrifice to the country.

398
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,420
But the media, once again, has a lot itself to be played by the military.

399
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,420
The military is tweaked the story of Pat Delman's death in Afghanistan in order to serve their purpose.

400
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,420
And it's a matter of media being manipulated by the military, by the government, by whatever,

401
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,420
because media doesn't actually, they don't do any work anymore.

402
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,420
They get pre-fed personal uses.

403
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,420
That's why they're open to pressure from outside of groups, because if you craft a story and a simple,

404
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,420
back to the simplicity argument in a simple way that the media can handle,

405
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
then you can get play for your story.

406
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,420
You can get your, your point of view out there.

407
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Oh boy, is that true?

408
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
That is so true.

409
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
But he's going to go on.

410
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
He's going to say that the media is stupid.

411
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Then I have to disagree with it.

412
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
But it's true what he's saying.

413
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,420
It's once you've got something focused.

414
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,420
And it's in a nice, bite-sized chunk, the media will eat that shit out.

415
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Because the media is, it's like a drum.

416
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,420
You know, if you can hit them right, you can play.

417
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Boring.

418
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,420
So it's a matter of, you know, from the Telman story in Afghanistan to the never-ending stream of stories

419
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:21,420
that comes out from the military's PR department that writes pre, you know, stories ahead of time for the media.

420
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,420
And it says, you know, how great things are going in Iraq.

421
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
That's sort of what they do.

422
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,420
And the media just follows, hey boy, and how's that dollar doing everybody?

423
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Huh?

424
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
How's that dollar?

425
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
You're paying for something America?

426
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
Wait a minute.

427
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
That's my tax dollars, too.

428
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Got a damn it.

429
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,420
It's along like the laptops that there are.

430
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,420
I'm not saying that the media doesn't necessarily has a conservative agenda.

431
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,420
I don't think the media necessarily has any sort of agenda other than a bias towards the stupid in the simple.

432
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,420
I don't think the necessarily, you know, are in the pocket of the Republicans,

433
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:57,420
even though a lot of the corporations that, you know, own the media are in favor of Republicans because I think the media is just dumb.

434
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,420
I think the media just does what the easy thing is.

435
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,420
If the easy thing is to report that the war's going bad, that's what they do.

436
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,420
If the easy thing is to report, you know, that the war's going awesome, that's what they do.

437
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,420
And I have to agree with all over here because, and that's not just because it's the easiest thing.

438
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,420
It's the most efficient use of time.

439
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:22,420
Basically, and I've seen this happen time and time and time again, particularly with news media, anything.

440
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,420
And particularly with television news, you know, you got to get the story, got to get the shot, got to run, got to move to that, you know,

441
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,420
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

442
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,420
So sometimes the reporter comes out predetermined, knows exactly the story he or she wants to get.

443
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Sometimes there's, you know, an investigation and then boom, this is it.

444
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
And I'm going to get that.

445
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,420
I'm going to focus on that and it's based upon ratings.

446
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,420
And the lead up to where we had no investigation of the war's claims.

447
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,420
Look at the New York Times, supposedly liberal New York Times.

448
00:27:51,420 --> 00:28:03,420
The New York Times devoted more space on its pages to explaining Jason Blair than to explaining the poor reporting of its own war of its own correspondence.

449
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
All right, okay.

450
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,420
So check out the Willis Effect, Oliver Willis.com.

451
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Another podcast that you actually can't receive yet is the Ken and Squip Show.

452
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,420
I think I've talked about this before.

453
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Ken Kencer J. Living in, well, fuck does he live?

454
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Oregon. Oregon, I think. Yeah, Oregon.

455
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Used to be my personal assistant, basically lived at my house.

456
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:36,420
And Cindy, the squip, squipper, who was one of my first employees at the thinking of ideas, actually when it was still called on ramp.

457
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,420
They've caught the podcasting vibe and they put up one show.

458
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,420
I talked about it, pointed to it.

459
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
And of course the inevitable happened.

460
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
Good line.

461
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Pre thanks, giving digital stampede,

462
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,420
ties up internet traffic for hours on East Coast.

463
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,420
The apparent culprit seems it was something called the Ken and Squip Show.

464
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,420
An internet audio talk show also referred to as a podcast.

465
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,420
An instant hit with geeks.

466
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,420
I take a fence to that personally, around the globe.

467
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
Yeah, hold on. I just want to play that bit.

468
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,420
What was it? The geeks.

469
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
There we go.

470
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
With a web geeks.

471
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,420
I take a fence to that personally, around the globe.

472
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,420
And after a plug by internet pioneer, Adam Curry,

473
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,420
very most of the Ken and Squip holiday extravaganza special,

474
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,420
exceeded all bandwidth limitations causing the eventual debacle.

475
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,420
And the untimely demise of our broadcasting empire as it turned out.

476
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,420
So we got basically our plug-pulled.

477
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,420
We were on the very eve of Thanksgiving.

478
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,420
While we were busy stuffing our birds,

479
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,420
we got bent over the coffee table and stuffed ourselves.

480
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Yeah, right on.

481
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
All right.

482
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,420
So you can find it at audio.weblogs.com.

483
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,420
The show was listed on today's top-hundred podcasts.

484
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,420
So definitely give that, you know, check it out.

485
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,420
I'll put up a link in the podcast production show notes for today.

486
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,420
Because I actually, what I did as I hooked him up,

487
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,420
and I gave him a little bit of bandwidth off of one of our servers.

488
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
I think that, you know, listen to the show.

489
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
Let me know what you think about it.

490
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,420
I think we're a little bit of coaching and a little bit of technical help.

491
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,420
We could have a definite, you know, pod squad membership coming up here.

492
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Because they're pretty funny.

493
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
And I'm not quite sure.

494
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I don't know if this has done all on Skype

495
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,420
if they're recording separately from their individual locations.

496
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,420
But it sounds great.

497
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,420
And I just love these two to death. They're funny.

498
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
Bantrax.

499
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Bantrax podcasts.

500
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Attention on Bantrax.net.

501
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,420
Hey Adam, this is Candace Lupus from Bantrax.net.

502
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
First, we wanted to thank you and all the others

503
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
that have made podcasting happen.

504
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
And our wives will also like to curse you

505
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,420
for taking up what little free time we did have for them.

506
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,420
We'd also like to tell you about our podcast at Bantrax.net.

507
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,420
What we do is we focus on independent artists, authors and comedians.

508
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,420
But with one difference, we also give them the place to sell their art on our website.

509
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,420
We take care of the hassle for a minimal $2 fee

510
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,420
and they get to make what they want from their work.

511
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Again, a big thanks for podcasting.

512
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
And we hope to see you around Bantrax.net.

513
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,420
That's B-A-N-D-T-R-A-X.net.

514
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
And by the way, we heard Patricia's story the other day

515
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,420
about Stevie Nix's stinky butt.

516
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Well, we have our own celebrity brush with stink.

517
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
Oh, yeah.

518
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,420
One time we were doing a news interview with Weird Alienca Vic in Australia.

519
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,420
And let me tell you that guy can stink up a stall.

520
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Bantrax.

521
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Bantrax podcast.

522
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Attention.

523
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
On Bantrax.net.

524
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Everybody.

525
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
All right.

526
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Excellent.

527
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
Excellent guy.

528
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
I see you on demand.

529
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
Okay.

530
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
Let's see.

531
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
And we're doing pretty good here.

532
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,420
We're going to make it in the 40-minute time window.

533
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Good, good, good.

534
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
It's what I was looking for.

535
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Winding it up with some more British culture.

536
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,420
And this is something I have to look at yourself through the podcast show notes.

537
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,420
An email that I got from Craig Morgan and Craig said,

538
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
and you just caught up with the last few daily source codes,

539
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,420
thought in your quest to understand the UK,

540
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
you might get some kick out of this.

541
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
It's the passport to the pub.

542
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,420
And this is actually a really big deal in the United Kingdom.

543
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
It's the pub.

544
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,420
And we're still kind of looking for our local pub and where it is,

545
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
and we're supposed to go.

546
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,420
And of course, once we're there,

547
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,420
how we're supposed to act and kind of fitting with the locals.

548
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,420
So it's this whole, and it's really,

549
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,420
it's a social issues research center that is published this.

550
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
It's what the pub is about,

551
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
the background, choosing your pub,

552
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
how to make contact.

553
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,420
What, you know, pub talk, when to treat,

554
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
when it's your round.

555
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,420
And then, of course, the opposite sex,

556
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,420
and it turns out, and guys, check this out.

557
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
Where is it?

558
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Until about 20 years ago,

559
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,420
it was pretty much a macho thing,

560
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,420
but now women, women, women,

561
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,420
make up more than half of the pub going audience.

562
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Wow.

563
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
I can't.

564
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
You know, English women, man.

565
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,420
I haven't really studied them yet.

566
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Patricia pointed some cute women out to me,

567
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,420
what we're doing grocery shopping today.

568
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
And I don't know if she did that.

569
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
I don't know why she did that actually.

570
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,420
I was on the phone talking to Alessandro,

571
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Italian journalist, who was interviewed me

572
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,420
for a magazine about podcasting clearly,

573
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
because there are a couple of Italian podcasts.

574
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,420
So maybe she just tried to distract me from that,

575
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,420
or, I don't know, but I gotta, I gotta figure,

576
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,420
well, you know what?

577
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,420
It's time for a pub cast.

578
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,420
That's what we're gonna do.

579
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
A pub cast, definitely.

580
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Looking forward to doing that.

581
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Oh, I gotta wind it up for today.

582
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Let's see.

583
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Oh, I love playing promos that I haven't heard before.

584
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,420
This is a wizard's holiday promo from Mr. Mark

585
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
and Digital Bill.

586
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Well, what the hell?

587
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Let's check it out.

588
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Hey, this is Digital Bill,

589
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
and this is Mr. Mark.

590
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
From the Wizards of Technology,

591
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
and we're just here to tell you

592
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,420
about our special holiday technology edition podcast.

593
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Very cool, huh?

594
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Absolutely.

595
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,420
We're both giving our top five favorite holiday

596
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
geeky technology gifts.

597
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
And not all of them are expensive.

598
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
We have a very double-corned,

599
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
a copy of goodies up there.

600
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Boy, it's a range of things all over the place.

601
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,420
So come on down to the website,

602
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,420
pick up the podcast for our special holiday technology

603
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,420
edition of,

604
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
go ahead.

605
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,420
The Wizards of Technology.

606
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Is it up?

607
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
You know, whenever someone tells you

608
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
is a veritable plethora of anything.

609
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
You know that you got to go check it out, right?

610
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
The Wizards holiday promo.

611
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,420
That's going to do it for the source code for today.

612
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Tomorrow I am off to London to the big city.

613
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
To big smoke as we call it.

614
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,420
I'll be there meeting with the banksters.

615
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,420
So I haven't quite decided yet

616
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
if I'm going to do a podcast.

617
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
I'm going to take the train by the way.

618
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
If I'm going to take do it on the way up

619
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,420
or on the way coming back.

620
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Or if I'm going to find a spot

621
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
and London to sit down,

622
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,420
maybe in and do the show.

623
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
I'm just having lunch.

624
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,420
So I will have plenty of time to figure out

625
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,420
how to do the cast of the pie.

626
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,420
And that's it for your source code for today.

627
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Tuesday, December 7.

628
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,420
Thanks so much for tuning in everybody.

629
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,420
Of course, comments are welcome.

630
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420

as an attachment in emails.

632
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,420
Don't you can keep it under five megs.

633
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
It should be okay.

634
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
Because I'm just leaving the email on during the night

635
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
to suck it all up and cash it.

636
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,420
Have it ready for me in the morning.

637
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
Like an email.

638
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,420
I thought it was kind of, you know, something like that.

639
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,420

You can find it.

643
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420

It's a good one.

651
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I'll check you tomorrow, everybody.

652
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Take care.
