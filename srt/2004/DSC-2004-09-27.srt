00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Tata Tata Tata Tata Tata

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
podcasting

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
this is daily so

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Adam Curry.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
How are you.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Hey, well good afternoon everybody a brand new opening for the show this listener supported show where users and developers part

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Thanks to Howard Greenstein, Howard, from New York, who's also requested that I play some

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,500
very choral on the show, which I'll certainly do once I can find my exclusive live recording

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
over.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
So, welcome to the source code for Monday.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Today is the 27th of September 2004.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
It's quarter to four in the afternoon, coming to you from Flanders, Belgium, from Curry

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Castle and we have a lot to talk about today.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
So much has happened over the weekend and it was several times I was just itching to

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
jump behind the machine and come on in, huh?

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
It's okay, I'm recording.

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
All right?

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Yeah.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
I just wanted to jump behind the machine and cut a source code but I really, you know,

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
there was just so much else going on and Christina who just walked into the bar slash

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
studio area who has the day off today from school.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:41,500
She won bronze medal with her, that was the national championships with her dressage, horse

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:41,500
riding.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Congratulations, Christina. She's very talkative today. Thank you. So I did have a couple chats

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
with different people over the weekend. Let's see, with Steve Gilmore, that was a Skype chat.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I've spoke to Dave Weiner a couple of times. And I've had lots of email conversations.

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
And the first thing I wanted to play for you today was, and I don't think I played this

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
on Friday, if I did I apologize.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,500
But remember Dr. Dave from Las Vegas gave me all the tips and pointers on how to record

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,500
the daily source code at the equal or close to equal quality of sound but with half the

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
file size.

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
And as you probably noticed from Friday's source code, the file was indeed about half

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
file size.

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
And I think the audio was still reasonably good.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
So props go out to Dr. Dave.

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
There did, there was a, well there were a couple of discrepancies and I thought I

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
caught it and I thought that I also thought, well maybe he's confusing bits with

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Hertz and whatever.

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,500
But Doug Kay, who is the producer of ITConversations.com, it's his, the

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
whole outfit is his as far as I know.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,500
By the way, Mia Culpa during the first or second trade secrets, I said that I

43
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
didn't think that Doug Kay was a streaming guy and that he sent me a very

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
friendly email.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
explaining exactly how much of a streaming guy he is.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So I stand corrected big time.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And of course he's hosting all the IT conversations and is also...

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's in with us here on the loop on the iPod platform and he's a content producer.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's great. And he has a lot of experience with file sizes and recordings

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and he came back with a response which is an audio.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's very nice. To Dr. Dave.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So without further ado, here's Doug Kay with more tips on how to reduce your file size.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hello Adam and listeners to the Daily Source Code.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is Doug Kay, the host and producer of IT Conversations.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I just wanted to respond to something you broadcast in your show on Friday.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It was a clip from Dr. Dave of Las Vegas and Dr. Dave was trying to answer the question about what bit rates to use.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And unfortunately he made a fairly significant error.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He said for example that a 32k bit rate was totally adequate for voice

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
that it reproduced 16kHz audio that it was as good as FM.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
that's not the case. Dr. Dave is confusing a couple of different technological issues.

61
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:22,500
He's confusing the bit rate of the MP3 audio with the sample rate. The sample rate is controlled

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
by something called the subnyquist theorem. The subnyquist theorem says that if you want

63
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:35,500
to sample analog data, you can use the sample rate to measure the sample rate.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that you must sample at twice the highest frequency you want to reproduce.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So for example, if you want to reproduce 16 kHz audio, you need to have 32,000 samples per second.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now in wave file format, which is a lossless format, those are typically 16-bit samples or 2-byte samples.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So sampling at 32,000 samples per second is actually 64,000 bytes per second,

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
which is in fact 512,000 bits per second.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So that's the sample rate, but it has relatively little to do with the bit rate of the MP3 encoder.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
MP3 is a lossy compression technique similar to JPEG.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We're going to throw away a lot of data when we get these compression ratios of 20, 30, 40 to 1 and so forth.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A 64k bit per second MP3 is generally considered the equivalent of FM.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's arguable, I think that a 64k MP3 doesn't sound quite as good as good FM.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think a 96k bit per second MP3 is closer to a...

75
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
good FM signal, but that depends on the program material.

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Here's a brief history of the MP3 encoding rates we've used here at IT Conversations.

77
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
When I started a year and a half ago, I encoded everything at 32 k bits per second.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
The quality wasn't good, but I still got a number of complaints that the files were

79
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
too big.

80
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,500
The reason was that the MP3 players in those days could not take very large files.

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Over time things have changed quite quickly.

82
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Until recently we encoded everything at 48 k bits per second.

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
We got very few complaints.

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,500
But now people who have MP3 players that have quite a bit more storage, such as a 40

85
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
gigabyte iPod, are asking us to use higher quality bit rates.

86
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
They don't mind the larger files.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,500
So just within the past week I've started encoding our files at 64 k bits per second.

88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
That results in about 30 megabytes for one hour of audio.

89
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,500
And that's my current recommendation for what people should be using for audio blogs,

90
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
daily source code, and the like.

91
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
By the way, it's also not true.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that you need a higher bit rate for music than for voice. The waveform of human

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
voice is very, very complex and in fact you will hear distortion in the human

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
voice before you can detect it in most music, the reason being that you may not

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
know how to predict the waveform in music. Whereas with voice if you know the

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
person you have certain expectations of what their voice will sound like. Another

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
question that comes up is stereo versus mono and you need double the bit rate

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
for stereo or are stereo files twice as large as mono files. In wave files they

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are twice as large because it is a lossless format but in MP3 one of the

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
things that you're encoding is the difference between the left and right

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
channels. So for example if you're recording voice from a single microphone

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
it really doesn't matter whether you use a stereo MP3 at 64k or a mono MP3 at

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
64k bits per second because they'll be essentially the same. The only time

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that it really matters is when you have program material where the left and

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
right channels are substituted.

106
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,500
different. As to the question of VBR or variable bitrate, this is a technique that does allow

107
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,500
the MP3 to vary the bitrate from one frame to the next, but it's not supported by certain

108
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,500
players so I do not recommend recording VBR for audio blogs and the like. There's really

109
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,500
nothing to gain. Anyway, if you have any questions, send me email Doug at ITConversations.com

110
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
or you might want to check out a wiki page that I just posted to deal with this topic.

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Go to www.ITConversations.com slash wiki w-i-k-i and somewhere there you'll find a link to the

112
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,500
page that deals with MP3 encoders and file formats and things like that. Hope this has been helpful.

113
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Keep up your great work on the daily source code. So far I haven't missed a single show

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
and I hope not to. Thanks.

115
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Alright Eve, thank you very much Doug Kay from ITConversations.com. Wow, that was

116
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,500
some excellent, excellent source code you dumped on us. Indeed, after listening to Dr. Day from

117
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Vegas and

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and the response from Doug Kay, I did get my file size down to about half,

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and I am running also about 15 megs per half hour, so about 30 megs for an hour.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And there was some mail that came in, hold on a second,

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm going to switch applications here,

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
now we've had bad luck with that in the past, it's working out.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
From Eric Elliott, I just want to share that with you.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He said they had a chance to catch up, listen to this past week's Daily Source Code,

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
also trade secret show with Dave.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Want to address one topic you mentioned both in one of your Daily Source Codes

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and on trade secrets is about the AAC audio format.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He says, now I certainly don't have any arguments against using MP3,

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and that would be my choice too, since it's the most widely universally accepted format right now.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But I wanted to clear up a misconception about AAC.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
AAC is not Apple's proprietary format.

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a standard that was basically developed by the MPEG group as the successor to MP3.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It is actually the audio component to MPEG 4 video.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
However, what is proprietary is the fair play DRM, that's digital rights management,

135
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Apple is put on top of AAC in the iTunes music store. The reason that the

136
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,500
tunes purchased from iTunes music store only work on iTunes and the iPod is

137
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,500
because of the DRM, not AAC. But a non-fair play AAC will play on a variety of

138
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,500
players. Just wanted to clear that up. That's Eric Elliott. Thank you very much,

139
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Eric. And he also posts a link, apple.com, slash mpeg4, slash AAC for some

140
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
more information on that. Excellent. So I still think we should stick with mp3,

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
but I'd like to hear a little bit more if people have more information. You know,

142
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
this is a format that is just as, I don't know if it's just, if it can be just as

143
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,500
open as mp3. Who controls mp3? No one. Is there a standards body or something? I

144
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,500
don't think so. Well, there probably is. And I'm sure by now people will already

145
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
be hacking away the email to set me straight. What I'm going to do right now

146
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
is probably inviting Murphy in, but I just wanted to take a screenshot of my

147
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
setup so you can see how I've

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
got the show lined up for today because I don't have notes. I used to keep an

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
outliner handy with notes and now I just have all of my my different sound clips.

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I have quite quite a few all set up and ready to fire and they're in a

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
chronological order. So it may screw up the recording but I'm just gonna try

152
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
this. Hold on.

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's thinking about it.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay. Let me just see.

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yup. Took a picture. Okay. Great.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So we've got that and I'll post that because

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
great excitement for me over the weekend.

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Just as I was, you know, about to give up on the Rubik's Cube

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of how we can route audio back and forth, particularly

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
like a radio station does where you call into a show,

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in this case the call in is through iChat or

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
AOL into Messenger or Skype or a SIP phone.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And we hear you on the air and we can control your volume,

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
turn you on and off, but you also hear everything we're doing

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
on the air minus your voice. So you can't be sending back

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a total signal because then you get this feedback loop.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And to me that was a Rubik's Cube I've been struggling with

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
for two weeks now. And I ran across, actually

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
through my referral log, Hugo Schochmann.

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He's from, you see, he lives in Zurich and you can

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
check out his weblog at log.

172
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:18,500
and that's h-u-g-o-s-c-o-t-m-a-n dot com.

173
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
And Hugo had been listening, he posted his whole bit on his blog about how he had been

174
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
listening.

175
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
out the trade secrets and he came up with a proof of concept and he actually recorded both

176
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
sides of the conversation.

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I thought for a second there that he had also run into the echo problem but it turns out

178
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,500
he didn't and he had indeed found the perfect setup and posted a diagram that was beautiful.

179
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,500
I had downloaded the Soundflower virtual audio device a while ago in the beginning of

180
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,500
my quest to figure out the perfect setup and just around when he's doing this setup

181
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
all of a sudden things start to click in my head.

182
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Maybe it was just from listening to his MP3 because he hadn't posted it to his site yet but I was

183
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I think he might be, you know, maybe he did it this way.

184
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
And even though we came up with a different way of doing it,

185
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm using Audio Hijack Pro, he's using a different, see what.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
record. And he's also using GarageBand which I used to use and now longer he's just posted

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
a whole bunch of updates with great screenshots. Let me just see, what is he's using Soundtrack

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
thing? Yeah, Soundtrack to record. And you know what? You need no external gear. And

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the Soundflower virtual device is open source, it's freely available so please check out

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Hugo's weblog. It is phenomenal. I'm so pleased that we have someone who's you know

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
who's all over this and is helping us set it up. Now granted this is all still on a

192
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Mac and actually when I did a test call with Dave he was crying saying you know

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I want to play music too. I was jamming tunes down the pipe too. It was great.

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So we will keep working at it. Let me see. Actually I just got back from a

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
quick trip up to Breda. It's about 30 minutes from our house by car. That's in

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
the Netherlands where coffee shops are legal. I had to go get a new supply.

197
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I have actually the harvest that I had here at home for those of you following. I have tried it

198
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,500
It's it's okay, but it's saying because it's all totally organic and I didn't really you know use any

199
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Anything special on it. You got to smoke an awful lot before it has the desired effect

200
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,500
So anyways, I went up to get a little supply these guys that run the coffee shop from Morocco. So they're all

201
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
They're all Arabs. I know I'm really well and we hang out and we drink

202
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Chinese tea Moroccan Moroccan tea which is basically Chinese tea with mint leaves and a ton of sugar in there and

203
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,500
So I just chilling out and we're talking and he was reading a Moroccan newspaper

204
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
And I and was a picture of Bush and Perry on the front page and we got to talking and

205
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,500
It was just you know, I think what we concluded and it would have really made for a good a good podcast

206
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Although it was in like four different languages. It was you know, Morocco and Morocco that besides Arabic

207
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
They also speak French so it was French. It was Dutch. It was English. It was

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
some Arabic words, some general high Arabic, which is generally understood.

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And so I think what we concluded was that all politicians, everyone in government,

210
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
they're all in it for the money. Most of them are in it for the money.

211
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
All the big guys are. What was he telling me? He's saying the new president of Palestine,

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
so there's a new guy. He apparently owns a huge factory in Israel.

213
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Everyone's just in the game for a lot of their own interests.

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And certainly we know Bush is. And he said, yeah, maybe if we get Kerry,

215
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
then we have a chance at figuring out what he's about before he can really get his hoax in.

216
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But Kerry's the same. There's big money there. There's his wife with Heinz.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There's all kinds of cronyism and nepotism and everything going on in government at all different levels.

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And what I think what we base...

219
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,500
What basically concluded is, in 30 years there will be a new generation, there will be our

220
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,500
kids and they'll hopefully have grown up a little bit differently and they'll have different

221
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,500
values and will think about religion differently and won't hate each other.

222
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Kind of like the Germans now.

223
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Germany completely flattened the Netherlands, occupied it outright, just killed people,

224
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,500
kicked off a million Jews, flattened Rotterdam.

225
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
The Germans still come to Holland on vacation, they sit on our beaches and we get along fine

226
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
and all the young Germans or...

227
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
generation, 30 to 40 years old, we don't give a fuck about what happened then.

228
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
We hope we can learn from it and we get along and there's no animosity.

229
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And that eventually will probably happen in other parts of the world where huge conflict

230
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,500
is abound at this time.

231
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
There was a couple other points that we came up with.

232
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Well I said that clearly this is where the internet probably will speed up that cycle.

233
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm hoping 10 years maybe because we're just not buying it anymore.

234
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
We're not buying what's in the media.

235
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,500
We're not buying what's in what's being shown on television, the speeches.

236
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,500
We're being lied to.

237
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
You know you're being lied to.

238
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,500
within a millisecond that you're supposed to read that disclaimer and know that your actual

239
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,500
results will vary due to road and weather condition.

240
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,500
But anyway, it was always fun to have a political conversation in four different languages while

241
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:58,500
drinking some Moroccan tea and smoking some wonderful plant of Mother Earth.

242
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:05,500
But when I got back I checked my iPod or inbox, better known as my iPod, and I saw a whole

243
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
bunch of interesting new bush clips that had come up.

244
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
And I figured I might as well just do a little bush block here, including a political poem.

245
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
So first let me get to this first one.

246
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
This has probably been circulating around the internet.

247
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
That's why it shows up on the blog.

248
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,500
This is Bush, basically fucking up whatever he's saying.

249
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
He's trying to say peace, but it comes out a little bit differently.

250
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Listen to this little clip.

251
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:40,500
It's in the interest of a long-term peace in the world that we work for a free and secure and peaceful Iraq.

252
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,500
A peon's free and secure Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will have enormous historical impact.

253
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:57,500
A peon's free and secure Iraq.

254
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:07,500
A peon's free and secure Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will have enormous historical impact.

255
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
So that was one guffaw that I don't know where that came from.

256
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Another one. This is my favorite one and I'm sure this is going to come back to haunt George W. during his many years as ex-president.

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And they want us to leave. That's what they want us to do.

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And I think the world would be better off if we did leave.

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If we didn't, if we left, the world would be worse.

260
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The world is better off if it's not leaving.

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How am I gonna have that death? What?

262
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay, as the source code continues for Monday the 27th,

263
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've got a political poem for you.

264
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And it just showed up in my iPod. It's pretty good.

265
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Listen to it.

266
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,500
It's like we were relaxing, sit around talking.

267
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm not saying

268
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm not saying anything anymore.

269
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Man, I'm sorry, this is nice music and I don't want to spoil it with another political

270
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
tirade because I don't even like political poetry because most of it sucks and most

271
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
of the political stuff that comes out of it.

272
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Intimence glia die with pain slowly

273
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
slowly, painfully. You are all criminals. You will never go to jail. So just die as soon

274
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
as possible with great pain slowly. I would die the slowest who was painful death of all

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
of you. If it meant that just half of you would die now. Come in, liberal. Come in,

276
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm not interested in sick. I don't care. I hate you all and I hope you all die.

277
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
you

278
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Another political poem that was King Missile 3, I'm reading this from the ID3 tags, from

279
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
the album Royal Lunch.

280
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
And oh man, that's exercising your free speech there, isn't it?

281
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Damn.

282
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,500
But I think that just listening to that, the point is maybe just like we had Hitler, we

283
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,500
had Stalin, we had Mussolini, and they're all gone and new ones come and they're dictating

284
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
coffee. And then they'll go, eventually we all go and then new ones pop up and let's

285
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
just hope that we can steer some of our leaders. And I think that that's a lot about what

286
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
blogs are about and podcasting. It's exactly the same. It's all freedom of speech. It's

287
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
really, really important.

288
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay. Let me just go back to the mail bag because I had a lot of mail that came in.

289
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Jonathan Green sent me a note about Mars Edit. I was raving about that the other day,

290
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
hoping that they'll build in enclosure support pretty soon. I mean, I've been using it now

291
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
for the past, well, since whenever I started talking about it, it feels like about a week.

292
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I like it very, very much. It's really, I have a central place for all of my web

293
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
blog publishing. It's easy to edit. There's just no waiting involved, no waiting for

294
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
browsers to render. It's just, it probably stores a local copy of stuff in its own

295
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
cache. It's great. It's really good stuff. And he suggested installing the book

296
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,000
market.

297
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Because I said there was a script that you can post from Safari.

298
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
It's called the script.

299
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
It's called post from Safari in the Mars Edit Scripts menu.

300
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,500
And the bookmark is cool because it does the same thing,

301
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,500
only it also gives you a routing tag like via,

302
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
and then you put in whoever it came from.

303
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500
And just more good stuff, smart user stuff

304
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
that I'm really enjoying using.

305
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Let me see.

306
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
What is this here?

307
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,500
This is just a shout out from Kurt Wendelkern,

308
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
IT pro working for the US Navy.

309
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,500
It says, in case you've been noticing the .navy.mil hits

310
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:49,500
in your logs.

311
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Yeah, didn't go unnoticed.

312
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I try every day to move tech users in my giant organization

313
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
forward.

314
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Your stuff certainly helps me to keep thinking.

315
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Happy to hear it.

316
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,500
And that's a lot about what the source code is for.

317
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Let's try to get users and developers to party together.

318
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Hold on.

319
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Let me just see.

320
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,500
I had a couple other comments that came in.

321
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
through the weblog. Oh yeah, there have been some comments about, I posted that I'm pushing

322
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:26,000
about 9 gigs a day out through my servers for the daily source code and trade secrets.

323
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And I call that a bump in the road. And I mean that, you know, it is a bump in the

324
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
road. We're going to fix this. And I think the first and most important thing we can

325
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
do before we get to the ISP level is getting BitTorrent fully integrated. I played with

326
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that. I finally subscribed to my first BitTorrent feed. It's the, what is it? It's

327
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
the Air America archives. They have an archive, an RSS 2.0 podcast feed for

328
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
you to subscribe to. And it brings in recent shows through BitTorrent as

329
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
OGG files, which is another compression standard, which I think it's a pretty

330
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
geeky standard. It really compresses stuff incredibly. I think it compresses

331
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
about twice as much as MP3, at least it seems that way from the file size.

332
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I tune.

333
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Torrance doesn't support it out of the box, you have to download a plug-in.

334
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,500
But anyway, so if that's the way it's coming, then I still want to listen to it.

335
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,500
And iPod or X successfully got the BitTorrents, downloaded the show, it created the folder.

336
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,500
I didn't quite put the files into the folder and renamed them as mp.mp3 instead of it's

337
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
originally...

338
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But the iPod are concepts there and it's working.

339
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And what we need to do now is make the publishing of MP3s a little more easier.

340
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So that you don't have to go through the process of,

341
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I've done it myself just in local bench testing of,

342
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
okay, here we go.

343
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know, got to first create the MP3 tags,

344
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
then I'm going to make a bit torrent out of it,

345
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
then I have to upload the torrent and I have to upload the file.

346
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You know, that's just a lot of steps to go through.

347
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And then just briefly at the ISP level,

348
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I also did a test, I threw up the latest trade secrets on my .mac account

349
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
where I bought a gigabyte of disk space.

350
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You know, if you want to publish, there's going to be pain somewhere.

351
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Even if you have a web blog, if you get slash.com,

352
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Now, bandwidth is being commoditized, so you'll find that there are deals out there that can

353
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
really help you.

354
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But we want to make sure that we're not victims of our own success here, and shouldn't be

355
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
that every single time your show takes off and people are listening to you and you've

356
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
got a popular show, that your bandwidth bill goes up.

357
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
That's not the economy of scale that traditional radio or television have.

358
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And I think that's where BitTorrent is going to help us.

359
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And that's mainly because this is not streaming, it's time shifting, it's downloading.

360
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I think that we can effectively distribute the load.

361
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I think we're doing a pretty good job so far with the integration of BitTorrent from

362
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
what I've seen in iPod or X.

363
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Also Danny Gregor, Gregor, Gregory, we've been emailing back and forth and I mentioned

364
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
him before on the source code.

365
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
He is submitting a proposal with our buddy Dave Slusher from Evil Genius Chronicles.

366
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
for the O'Reilly e-Tech conference.

367
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,500
And they're going to do it about podcasting and the iPod platform.

368
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
See, they actually have a, I guess they're calling it podcasting.

369
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Yeah.

370
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
And they invited me to go along with them.

371
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Now that's not going to work schedule-wise with the move and everything.

372
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Excuse me.

373
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Hold on, let me just get rid of this.

374
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
That's better.

375
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:01,500
So I said, but no, please, you guys go have a ball and let's see, you know, apparently

376
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
that's the conference to be at.

377
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,500
I don't know, I don't really do a lot of conferences, certainly not conference conferences, but

378
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,500
they're submitting your proposal and I guess they're going to get out there and we're

379
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,500
keeping an eye on them and they'll be reporting to us, of course.

380
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,500
So, I'm going to be doing conferences, BloggerCon 3 coming up the 6th of November in

381
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Palo Alto, bloggercon.org is where you want to check it out and I'll be leading a

382
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,500
discussion on podcasting myself.

383
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
And I wrote up a description today, you can check it out, it's on the web blog at

384
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
bloggercon.com.

385
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,500
And if anyone listening to this podcast, you know, can come or is planning on coming,

386
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
let me know, you know, let's get some stuff set up.

387
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I really hope we can have a massive jam parties.

388
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
We're all bringing our mobile studios and we need to talk about setups and how

389
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:53,500
it works.

390
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and all the stuff that we're talking about on the iPod or dev list.

391
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You can hear by the way that our good buddy Luke is blowing the leaves outside the castle at the moment,

392
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
outside of the bar door where we are.

393
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Alright, let's play some more fun stuff.

394
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I got an email from Tony.

395
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And now my email, there we go.

396
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Tony Khan.

397
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He was another fan of the source code.

398
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
He's in Boston and he's working at Public Radio at WGBH.

399
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And he does, let me see if he, yeah, I think he produces, I don't know if he hosts it,

400
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
but he produces a series of short stories called Morning Stories.

401
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And he pointed me to them and you can get them in streaming.

402
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
There's also a download MP3 archive and they're really good.

403
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And so I suggested, well, you know, dude, why don't you get an RSS 2.0 podcasting feed together.

404
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And I'll point to it and then everyone can enjoy this.

405
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It won't be that much.

406
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,500
better. And so he said, well, yeah, certainly, what was this quote here? Hi, Adam, wish there

407
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:05,500
was an RSS feed your way ahead of us that makes you such a force in changing the face

408
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,500
of radio. I'll see if I can make it happen. You know how hard it is to make an elephant

409
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,500
sized operation like WGBH remember it can still dance. Tony, I'm sure you are teaching

410
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:21,500
it new steps as we speak. And I want to play this bit, which is one of the from the morning

411
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,500
story series. Meanwhile, hopefully by the time we get back the leaf blowing will

412
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:33,500
have diminished a little bit. Check this one out. It's titled 1-800-YOUR-DAB.

413
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Hello?

414
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Cold?

415
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Heathunt?

416
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Door?

417
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
De-

418
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
tied up at work right now.

419
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000

420
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Press 1 if you call to chat.

421

Press 1 if you want to hear about my problems.

426

Press 2 if you want us to hear about your problems.

427
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Press 3 at any time if what you really called about was money.

428
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
One.

429
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If you want to hear about my problems.

430
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
How far is one to hear what you think about.

431
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Huh?

432
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Press 2 to hear what we think about your planet.

433
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Cycle.

434
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
World with your barbarian friends.

435
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
What's wrong with them?

436
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Press 3.

437
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
You put really cool out with money.

438
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Great.

439
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,500
You finally pressed 3.

440
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Please enter now with the dollar amount you are requesting.

441
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Followed by the pound sign.

447
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
The heck I won't get it anyway.

448
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Hm.

449
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
And pound sign.

450
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
5,000.

451
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Who are you on?

452
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Press 1 to hear my lecture.

453
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500

457
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Question set by the turn name.

458
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Hmm.

459
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Please hold your request as being a set of songs.

460
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You're fine.

461
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Dad, it's a-

462
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's a-

463
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh, a lot of guys gotta do 500 bucks.

464
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes.

465
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Mom.

466
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Your request has just been electronically-

467
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Thanks for calling.

468
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Miss you

469
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
It's two to hear Duke bark.

470
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Bye.

471
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Press three to hear your little sister Judy tell you we don't understand her either.

472
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Bye.

473
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Some choice.

474
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Go with the dog.

475
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Hi Duke.

476
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Dog got a G.E.O.

477
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Yeah, there you go.

478
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:20,500
1-800- Your dad from WGBH and as soon as they get a feed together I will most definitely

479
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
point to it.

480
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Okay, so there's still a little bit of leaf blowing going on but you know what, maybe we'll

481
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,500
make this a double shot source code today.

482
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Playing a full hours worth of all the best that I've tripped across on the net.

483
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Let's listen to the Isles right now.

484
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Yeah.

485
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
It's pretty much a full hour.

486
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
It's a full hour, there we go.

487
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
That's the end of the video.

488
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
That's it.

489
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Bye.

490
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Bye.

491
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Bye.

492
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Bye.

493
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Bye.

494
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Bye.

495
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Bye.

496
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Bye.

497
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:32,500
I'd like to take a home for last, cause me this tongue got cheap on keeping on if I don't shield you.

498
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Europe, European Union where it is end of October because then I can download and happily

499
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
pay for a good version of the Isley Brothers who's that lady that's had a dropout somewhere

500
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
in the middle there. Come on people. Yeah, so I wonder how many of you skipped ahead

501
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
to this part and didn't listen to the Isley Brothers? Does everyone always listen to

502
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
all the songs? Let me know at adamantcurry.com. So yeah, we're going to make this a double

503
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
shot of the source code for today because just so much to talk about and what

504
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
what is what's the worst is when great stuff happens on Friday and then I sit

505
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
there you know all weekend thing I gotta talk about this stuff gotta remember

506
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
to talk about I'm writing stuff down

507
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
I've got bits and notes.

508
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,500
I mean, I've never, I haven't been this active since the first time I hosted the morning

509
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
show on Z100 in New York.

510
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
You know, I'm just totally, everything is show prep mode, which is great.

511
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
I love it because I have so much to talk about.

512
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
And it's my version of web logging.

513
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
On Friday, there was new Gilmore Gang that was put up.

514
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
You know how much I love this show?

515
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,500
It's ITConversations.com, the Gilmore Gang, Steve Gilmore, John Udell, Doc Searles,

516
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,500
and they always have some guests on there.

517
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,500
And I have to say, a lot of this show was about iPodder.

518
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,500
And I mentioned this on Trade Secrets because Dave called up and so we might have said, well,

519
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500
shoot, we're talking and we want to talk about this Gilmore Gang thing.

520
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
And so we recorded a show out of it and put it up.

521
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,500
If you haven't heard it, secrets.scripting.com.

522
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:27,500
And it was, you know, they kept wandering away to talk about suns, you know, buy

523
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,500
computer cycles, buy the hour offering.

524
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,500
I actually posted a link to that on my web log.

525
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
And they kept coming back to iPodder.

526
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It was great to hear.

527
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
They were clearly excited about it and it was wonderful to hear it.

528
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But there were some errors in there that now I was listening.

529
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You have to understand that if you read a newspaper and you read an interview or an article

530
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
about yourself and there's something wrong, I am like, oh, man, shit.

531
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And then you see it on TV.

532
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Sometimes you feel like throwing the remote.

533
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And you hear stuff on radio or your iPod and I'm like, ah, jump up and down.

534
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Like, no, that's not right.

535
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's not right.

536
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So I did get some interesting points wrong.

537
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And I was thinking about playing back the show, stopping it and talking about exactly what they

538
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
said.

539
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But I didn't have to because Saturday morning on my iPod waiting for me was a new evil genius

540
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
chronicle.

541
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Exactly that.

542
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,500
He did it in post-production and edit, but I figured I'll just play you a little bit

543
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,500
a clip and then the response that Dave gives to that clip because his response is just

544
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
excellent.

545
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
It just really cracked me up.

546
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,500
So this is a bit of the evil genius chronicles from September 25th, 2004, regarding the

547
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Gilmore gang of the same date.

548
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Well, there's an optional portion effectively of RSS called enclosures that bear the

549
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
greatest similarity to email attached.

550
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Hold on a second.

551
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
You know what I should do?

552
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,500
I should probably rewind this just a little bit, just so that you can hear Dave's

553
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
intro and who's talking here.

554
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Hold on a second.

555
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
And rewind this.

556
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Okay, you know, if you want to do a big set, you can probably call your

557
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
RSS and show them.

558
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
There's a...

559
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Here's what he had to say about it.

560
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Okay, hold on.

561
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Hold on.

562
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
We're almost there.

563
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Okay.

564
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Hold on.

565
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Hold on.

566
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,500
Hold on.

567
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Hold on.

568
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Hold on.

569
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Hold on.

570
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Hold on.

571
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,500
Hold on.

572
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
It's also actually important.

573
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
I hope I'm not...

574
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Okay, I'll play... Z also does a Mia call to hear which is important for context.

575
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,500
You and I are hearing this at different times.

576
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
I wrote down everything I wanted to say so hopefully I'm not

577
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,500
misremembering as I do this.

578
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,500
So we're going to hear the first piece and this is Scott Rafer from...

579
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,500
who's the CEO of Feedster. Here's what he had to say about it.

580
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,500
There's an optional portion effectively of RSS called enclosures

581
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,500
that bear the greatest similarity to email attachment than anything else.

582
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,500
And with the restriction you can only have one per RSS speed,

583
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
with per RSS entry.

584
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,500
And they've been gaining popularity recently and Adam Curry,

585
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,500
the former BH1 VJ who's now sort of done a lot with RSS

586
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
from the Netherlands,

587
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
put together a piece of software called iPodder,

588
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,500
i-p-o-d-d-e-r.org.

589
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
where you can go straight from RSS enclosures onto your iPod.

590
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And he's got his little daily radio show,

591
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
similar to a certain extent.

592
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
To this one, it goes up digital files on the web and whatever.

593
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's a soliloquy, mainly.

594
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But he put it out there and started

595
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
distributing his radio show this way.

596
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And then listenership took off.

597
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And so they put out the piece of software

598
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
as a come one, come all kind of little attachment

599
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
to drop onto your Mac.

600
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I don't believe there's a Windows version yet.

601
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And what Scott Johnson did was he reacted to this

602
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
in the growing popularity of enclosures,

603
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
putting together some master feeds up on Feaster's site

604
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
so that you can have an RSS feed of all the MP3s that

605
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
come through the system, all the JPEGs, all the video files,

606
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
all the calendar events even.

607
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So his advocacy and his company obviously is

608
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
supporting things to help this platform out.

609
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
I had a couple annoying little errors in there,

610
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,500
which as I posted about this earlier in the weblog,

611
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,500
I ascribed him as working for Technorati,

612
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,500
so I make the annoying little errors myself too.

613
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
I don't think Adam ever worked for VH1.

614
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
It was, I think, only MTV.

615
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
That's not a biggie.

616
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,500
No, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

617
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
To me, that is a biggie.

618
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I used to host Headbangers Ball, dude.

619
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,500
I mean, it's like, oh man, that's so rough.

620
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,500
The only real VJ that was ever on VH1,

621
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
besides Rosie O'Donnell, by the way,

622
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,500
and I did her audition,

623
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
and she got hired because of me,

624
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,500
was Tim Bird the Birdman.

625
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
You're probably still here to see him

626
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
somewhere around your...

627
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:10,500
So no, that's actually quite, so I'll say that I was from VH1 and I was jumping up and down

628
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
when I heard that, like, come on man, that's unfair.

629
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,500
But of course maybe that's because MTV no longer actually plays music videos and VH1

630
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
does, so it may just be a very honest mistake.

631
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Let's continue now with the Dave Slush's analysis of the statement.

632
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,500
It isn't really an error, but something about the way he said stuff kind of rubbed

633
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
me the wrong way.

634
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,500
You notice that he uses the word little like three times.

635
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,500
Adam's little radio show and this little program that you put on there and it runs

636
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
on its little subscription.

637
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,500
To me that, I don't know, that just sounds like derogation and kind of

638
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,500
diminution of what we're doing here.

639
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,500
I mean, it's not something to get your, you know, be so thin skin that that

640
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,500
bothers you about, but I don't know why he's using that adjective.

641
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Oh, Dave, I think I can tell you why.

642
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Because people who talk like that, and I listen, I caught that as

643
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,500
well. I was like, whoa, I see saying a little this and a little that.

644
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And usually people who say that have a psychological thing.

645
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And of course everything you say is always based upon your own

646
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
psyche and your own frustration.

647
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So he probably has a small penis.

648
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That seems kind of out of place.

649
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
As does soliloquy, because it sounds almost, I don't know,

650
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
accusatory.

651
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Like, Adam's show is a soliloquy.

652
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And guess what?

653
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
This shows a soliloquy too.

654
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Is that, I mean, any one person talk radio show

655
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
is like that.

656
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And I replayed that bit four times.

657
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What does he say?

658
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, I couldn't understand it.

659
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And it wasn't until I heard Dave's analysis that I heard it

660
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
was soliloquy.

661
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And I had to look it up.

662
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I had to look it up on dictionary.com.

663
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Hold on a second.

664
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Let me bring up the definition of soliloquy.

665
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I think I posted to my web log about that as well.

666
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
No, hold on a second.

667
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Let's just get soliloquy.

668
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's even hard to say.

669
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Soliloquy.

670
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Damn, it's the word of the day.

671
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:17,500
a day. So lilikwy. Let me see. Where is it? Here, so lilikwy. A dramatic or literary form

672
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,500
of discourse in which a character talks to himself.

673
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
his or her thoughts without addressing a listener.

674
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
That's not true.

675
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
That's just not true.

676
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,500
I'm totally 100% addressing listeners here.

677
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,500
And the only reason I'm stopping by, I'm just making light of the situation.

678
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
I'm tickled to death that these guys talked about it.

679
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Really am.

680
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,500
And I'm so happy that Feaster is supporting us.

681
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
But shit, I got a whole hour to fill here.

682
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
You know what I'm saying?

683
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
Let's just see if Dave has anything left here.

684
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,500
When he talked radio show in the period between they're taking calls, that's a salute.

685
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
That's just the way it goes.

686
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
But it is interesting that Feaster is behind this.

687
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,500
I don't know that I would ever use a Feaster feed to aggregate for the same reason when

688
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,500
we were going around.

689
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Alright, so that's a whole different conversation.

690
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,500
You should listen to Dave's show if you want to check out all of that.

691
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,500
But anyway, it's a hilarious analysis of that conversation on the Gilmore Gang, which

692
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
is still one of my favorite shows.

693
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,500
So just saying howdy guys, we're listening to you.

694
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
I don't miss one of your shows either.

695
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
In fact, I'm really upset when I miss one of your shows.

696
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Let me see, what else do we have left?

697
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oh, I ran across an interesting podcast.

698
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Let me just see and look at the metadata here.

699
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
This is from Peter Overbaker.

700
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's called Ghost in the Machine.

701
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And well, you should just listen to it for yourself

702
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and you'll understand what he's doing immediately.

703
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I've taken off the first bit of the theme song

704
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and it almost goes straight into the actual start

705
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
of the podcast.

706
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Ghost and the Machine Audio Blog for Sunday September 26, 2004.

707
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Hi, all welcome to my very first audio blog, read to you by ReadPlease 2003.

708
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Because my own voice sucks, I thought this might be a fun solution.

709
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Well, it might not be as successful as Adam's or Dave's show.

710
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Well, anyway, shoot, there's Luke again with the leaf blower.

711
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So, clearly, you're not going to listen to a voice like that for very long.

712
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But I have to say, and this can't be Apple's speech synthesis that's built into OS X,

713
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
because it doesn't sound that good, I don't think.

714
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Maybe it is, but Peter should let us know.

715
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But it does seem like it could be appropriate.

716
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
If I have a playlist of stuff that I want to listen to in the morning,

717
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
which includes a local weather report, it includes a sports update,

718
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and I say it's unlikely, right?

719
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Okay, so let's take a political update.

720
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Then I want to listen to a show that plays two new songs for the day.

721
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And then maybe there's something else that's totally...

722
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:02,500
automated that someone doesn't feel like setting up a voice track every single day.

723
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
You could automate that with tech.

724
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Maybe the weather report is like that.

725
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,500
I think it'd be pretty boring, but I think it's certainly useful.

726
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,500
I think there's a spot for it in everything that we're doing.

727
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Again, this could be used for so many things.

728
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Just look at the telephone.

729
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,500
Look at a web log and say, what can this be used to make money?

730
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
How can I use this to make money?

731
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,500
I forget the web log.

732
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Look at a telephone.

733
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
It's the same thing.

734
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Just think about what we're doing with radio.

735
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
We're doing two radio.

736
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:37,500
The spot where radio makes its money is during drive time in the morning and the afternoon.

737
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,500
It's a very different way of consuming information because you're not going anywhere physically.

738
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
You're sure you're moving along the road.

739
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Hopefully, maybe you're in traffic.

740
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
You're moving along slowly, but you're not getting out of your car.

741
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Besides the cell phone, there's not much else to do in the way of entertainment.

742
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
You're stuck there in the most.

743
00:51:57,000 --
