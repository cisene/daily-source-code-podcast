1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, here we are at Curry Castle.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, the second is to make sure I've got everything rolling here.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are just wrapping up the BBC stuff.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It wasn't really a chance for me to podcast or to record anything earlier,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because we were doing exteriors.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They did a cool show for them arrived by a helicopter.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we've got quite a crew here.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So now I've got a record for my podcast.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll just say anything you say,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
kind of we'll be used against you.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In a podcast of law.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm recording.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I certainly am.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is reality.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh my god.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So anything you say, Colin.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello, everybody in America.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the BBC.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So you're talking to my chest.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not very convenient.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hi.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, it works.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to meet my wife.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, here we go.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, it's coming up on 620 coming to you from Flanders Belgium from Curie Castle.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Almost live.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It is the daily source code.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And God is Friday, everybody.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I mean, everybody.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Adam Curie here bringing you kind of an interesting daily source code.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's probably the first time that I'm ever going to edit pieces of the show in.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I've had the BBC visiting here for most of the day for a new program that actually just started

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
airing the other day on that BBC 2.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The culture show.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And while of course, when you come to interview someone about podcasting,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
you basically want to see him podcasting.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I'm not only going to show some of that,

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but also I'll cut in some bits of the whole day that I recorded while they were here.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We had a good time.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We had the Wing Commander William flying me in.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We actually, we look like a real professional, unprofessional proof,

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which is kind of what podcasting is all about.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Planks and tunes you've heard before on the source code.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's no Jones from Holland and Revolution.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So they're going on the side.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And the way it is, my mind.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or since telling me, I should think about it before I act.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But every time I look at you,

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and then you don't leave the word I say on my Jones.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My Jones still do to do an unplug set here at the castle,

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but they'd better hurry up because we only have a couple more days before we move and

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we're off to the UK ourselves.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Maybe if we move fast enough, we can watch this on TV.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I figured that we'd to show some of the real power of podcasting,

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and what we can do as a demo.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you guys still rolling on this?

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Beautiful. Beautiful.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is we'll show you how we have,

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
even though we're just using PCs, personal computers,

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
laptops, we have a lot of the stuff that the big guys have.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And I figured what I do is I see these online.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We'll actually bring in a phone call.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We're going to bring in Dave Weiner,

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the Mac Daddy of RSS and a weblog.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I'm going to give them a call right now on Skype.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey, Dave, how are you doing, buddy?

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey, a new drip is going to send you an instant message.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, I was just in your instant message,

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
but I can tell you now.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, you know what?

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
First of all, say hi to the BBC.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, BBC.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've revolted.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I tried to explain to them about the American radio voices and the

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
everybody thing.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I think they kind of get it.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They don't have that horrible fish.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And everybody, let's do some horrible English accents.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That'll make us real popular.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So what you got going on, buddy?

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Lots, lots of stuff.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A couple of things.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like first, I was talking with Drew this morning really early.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And they did a really interesting thing on the Don and Drew show.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The way they recorded it.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She was in Los Althos and he was in Wisconsin.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I heard that show.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And it sounded great.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And they used, they recorded.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Bloodshed band on their end.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He emailed him.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Her side of it.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They were talking on his own.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And then he just like overlaid them.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And it came out fun.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And something that I was thinking that we definitely need to try that.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Because then we could get good quality on both ends when we do that.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was really good quality.

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So now we have a good cell phone connection that kind of makes a difference.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, buying an actual cell phone that works Dave helped.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No kidding.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The way they think of next.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, really.

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anyway.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It was this great story.

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have to go find it about Dick Cheney's penis.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, really?

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It was really a story about Dick Cheney's penis.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think this is perfect podcast material to prove what we're on the right track here,

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
changing the world.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's the man's head like a horse.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No way.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Apparently.

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And.

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Boy.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Boy.

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Boy.

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They had a picture of it to prove it.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh.

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Some of that threw instant message.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No.

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's all serious.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was in the middle.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They had it.

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It was really good.

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Down to are we recording this?

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Of course.

146
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Great.

147
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Let's see.

148
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Hold on a second.

149
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
So it's taken gotter.

150
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
T.A.

151
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
E.G.A.

152
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
And.

153
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
There it is.

154
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Okay.

155
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Oh.

156
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Boy.

157
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
All right.

158
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
The article is entitled Big Dick Cheney.

159
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Oh, wow.

160
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
It's a new paper.

161
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
I created a Dick Cheney editor with Scott Sampane.

162
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
It's the top is causing quite a stir.

163
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
The long magazine has seen.

164
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Let's just say.

165
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
So snugged in the Chinese penis little little to the imagination.

166
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
And we're not talking baseline.

167
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Unfortunately, you can't see the picture yourself.

168
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
They're not reselling the photo.

169
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
But it is at the public library if you live in Wisconsin.

170
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Are we better send on and drew down?

171
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah.

172
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
It's a Milwaukee Journal, basically.

173
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,500
And apparently the guy's got a big one.

174
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Yeah.

175
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Okay.

176
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
That was that thought pretty interesting.

177
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Whatever.

178
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You're not going to hear about that on BBC.

179
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
No.

180
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I doubt you will.

181
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
But hopefully they'll pick it up from the podcast and maybe catch on to that.

182
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
And they got a humor over there in the UK.

183
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
They talk about sex all the time.

184
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
And all the TV shows.

185
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Yeah.

186
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
They do more than America.

187
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
America.

188
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Hold on.

189
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Now they say.

190
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Wait.

191
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
You saying they don't talk about sex?

192
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Not a seven o'clock.

193
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
We're on the wrong show, Dave.

194
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
We clearly got the wrong show.

195
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
We wanted the late night show.

196
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Actually, it was baseball dead.

197
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I don't know what.

198
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
All right.

199
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm going to go into another tune here and show these guys some more.

200
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Actually, I'm going to do a play a tap dancing podcast or news piece.

201
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Is it usually where much still to the BBC people?

202
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Is that usually we much more serious than this?

203
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Well, we're pretty serious right now.

204
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Oh, that's true.

205
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
I've been serious all.

206
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
For the past five hours, they've been here.

207
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
I've been deadly serious.

208
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Why are they taking so long?

209
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Because it's the BBC.

210
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
You have no idea.

211
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
They've got, I mean, they have producers and lighting people and sound.

212
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
They even, Dave, they had tracks.

213
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
They laid down tracks to move the camera.

214
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Like in a movie.

215
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
I mean, these guys got money.

216
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
They know how to produce television, man.

217
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
They've got it all down.

218
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
That's amazing.

219
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah.

220
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You've been here for so far.

221
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
You've been here for so far.

222
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Those nice BBC people.

223
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
They need to do it.

224
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, a second.

225
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Yeah.

226
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
It's not mentioned this now.

227
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
10, we're not here.

228
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
And this is us.

229
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
We're not even in the room.

230
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
They want us to fake it, Dave.

231
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Yeah, we'll be kidding.

232
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
I'll do it.

233
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I'll do it.

234
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
You don't talk about Dick Cheney.

235
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
What do you mean we don't talk about Dick Cheney?

236
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I mean, I mean, not the root stuff for me.

237
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
I can't use it.

238
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Only I know.

239
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
But that was just a, that's funny.

240
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
But it's, I can't use it.

241
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
They can't use the penis stuff, Dave.

242
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,500
So I, I want as much chat from you in vision because we can see you.

243
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Right.

244
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
That I've listened to before.

245
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah.

246
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
It's very good.

247
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
And you're good at good broadcasting.

248
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
So I just want to get some of that.

249
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,500
And it's fun to have input down the phone.

250
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Like banter.

251
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Yeah.

252
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
If it's, if it's lots and lots of chat from him, we can't see him.

253
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Gotcha.

254
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
It's boring for the viewer.

255
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
But we love you forever.

256
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
You hear that, Dave?

257
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Yeah.

258
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
I don't know what we got to do about this.

259
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
This is a clash of the media here.

260
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Totally.

261
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Well, I was talking about your daughter.

262
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
And about how, like, you know, did you get a chance to think about,

263
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
you know, the whole bit.

264
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Maybe you didn't want to talk about this.

265
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I don't know.

266
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Well, I'll tell you what.

267
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I'll tell you what.

268
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm going to, I'm going to play a couple things.

269
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
So at least they have what they want.

270
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
So hold on a second.

271
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
So they're with me.

272
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Bear with me.

273
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Because the one thing that we've been talking about,

274
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
uh, on not only trade secrets,

275
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
but on the daily source code as well,

276
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
is about trying to get this one wonderful podcast

277
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
who was out there who was bringing us her daily report.

278
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, actually, it's almost a daily report in a complete,

279
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
new way of presenting the news.

280
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Do you know what I'm talking about here, Dave?

281
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I do.

282
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
It's got to be the tap dance and podcast news.

283
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Check it out.

284
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Dallas, and then later, if that has died,

285
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
or he is not of liver failure,

286
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
a mysterious blood disease or a poisoning plot,

287
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
like, Schrodinger's cat.

288
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
He may be half dead and half alive.

289
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Hold on. This is the one where I got to provide the tap dancing for her.

290
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Invisitors fighting to take this place for nine.

291
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Lower the voters and back to our seeking therapy.

292
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Deep hypnosis because they're wearing and staring at walls

293
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
when there's nothing to see.

294
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
It's called post-delections lecture trauma.

295
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Suckers want to move to Canada or back home with Mama.

296
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
And the Scott Peterson trial thing of yours

297
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
has been dismissed for doing research on her own.

298
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
If she was holding out for not guilty,

299
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
there'll be a fewer,

300
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
as Scott gets the tear.

301
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
And Derek also says to her,

302
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
he was blowing up this bulletin just in

303
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
aircraft that's condition is worse.

304
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
He's in a coma or he's eating

305
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
or heading for Palestine in a hurry.

306
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Damn, this is an old one.

307
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
He's already dead by now.

308
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
We need an update on the podcasting tap dance

309
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
or news, don't we?

310
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Am I on the air?

311
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Yeah, you're on the air now.

312
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Sure, absolutely.

313
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Come on in.

314
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
I just want to tell this BBC guy is that

315
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm going to be on C-Spare.

316
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I don't know.

317
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
I don't know.

318
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Maybe it's more letters than BBC,

319
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
but I still think there's a big difference.

320
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,500
They know Ariana Huffington.

321
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
They know Ariana Huffington.

322
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I don't know.

323
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
I don't know.

324
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm going to be on with...

325
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Maybe they know her as Ariana status.

326
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm not supposed to talk to them.

327
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
They're not even there.

328
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
No, there's no one here.

329
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
There's no camera.

330
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
There's no BBC.

331
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
I don't see anything.

332
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I don't think.

333
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
What?

334
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm not objecting.

335
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm not about to be someone.

336
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
You know what?

337
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
I am not a British stud.

338
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm not.

339
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm sorry.

340
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
This is calling by the way Dave.

341
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Hi Dave.

342
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Hi Dave.

343
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Can you hear me?

344
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
You're great.

345
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Good.

346
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm going to be borrowing Adam for about five minutes to do another intro to the show.

347
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
And I want him to pretend that we're not even here.

348
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
He's going to...

349
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Well, he says,

350
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Bumpy's Gums.

351
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm going to make that an international expression for talking.

352
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
He's going to Bumpy's Gums about stuff.

353
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Nothing through the BBC.

354
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Nothing through the fact that we're here.

355
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,500
That we can use as an introduction to his show and what he does.

356
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
So we're going to go for that.

357
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Can I know?

358
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I don't really add him.

359
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
So you hear that Dave?

360
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm being directed.

361
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
It's entirely what you add him.

362
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Yeah.

363
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Yeah.

364
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I feel for you, my brother.

365
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Yeah.

366
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I understand what they want.

367
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Yeah.

368
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
But it's exactly what it is.

369
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
The thing is that it's no problem at all.

370
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
But it's exactly counter to what podcasting is, of course.

371
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Yeah.

372
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
But that's OK.

373
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
So I'm going to give them a nice little...

374
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
A nice little demonstration.

375
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Hold on.

376
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm going to get my stuff set up here.

377
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
OK.

378
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I'll call you back in five minutes, Dave.

379
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
OK.

380
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
All right.

381
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Let's see.

382
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
So I don't want to make this two-stock term.

383
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The bell.

384
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Let's go.

385
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
All right.

386
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
So how often do you post costs?

387
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I do it five days a week.

388
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
I just do it every single day.

389
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
But then I got a real trouble with my two girls.

390
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
My wife and my daughter.

391
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
And I said, well, can we like have no podcasting on the weekend?

392
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
So...

393
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
But this is it.

394
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
This is...

395
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Well, this is actually my office when we bought the castle.

396
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Well, yeah.

397
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
It's a bar.

398
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
So it's actually...

399
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
You know what's so great about it?

400
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
The height is perfect.

401
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
So you're not that small either.

402
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
But the height is perfect to put the laptop right up here.

403
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
I've got everything in front of me.

404
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
This is the beauty about podcasting.

405
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
We basically have all this stuff on our computers.

406
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
So here you see a little microphone processor.

407
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
No.

408
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
You're being from radio.

409
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
You recognize some of the things, right?

410
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,500
There's a little meter that's registering.

411
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
And really what's fun is it's all being recorded on this little device here.

412
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Okay.

413
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
How...

414
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Okay.

415
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
You've got a power book here.

416
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah.

417
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah.

418
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
What was the market then?

419
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Okay.

420
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Well, now, of course, I'm a rich podcaster.

421
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
So I got a little wireless.

422
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
That's my very much like the ones you use.

423
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
So here's your microphone.

424
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
There's my microphone.

425
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
What about pulpy for wadding me?

426
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh, well, four people talking to the microphone here.

427
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
There's a microphone built in.

428
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Or actually, you know, for like 20, 20 euros,

429
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
you can buy one of these microphones, which is just that.

430
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
There you go.

431
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
How many pounds?

432
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
About 12, 15 pounds.

433
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Yeah, something like that.

434
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
It's just a USB microphone that you can plug right into into your computer.

435
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Right.

436
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
And that's really all you need.

437
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
All the recording stuff.

438
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
You can record directly onto your computer.

439
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Where for that?

440
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Okay.

441
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Personally, I like, this is all, this is like a 70 pounds external MP3 recorder.

442
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I plug it right into the headphones jack.

443
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Okay.

444
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
So you're sitting here and you're just talking about whatever the help

445
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
puts into your head.

446
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Well, so what would I do first?

447
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Hold on a second.

448
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
I get my monitoring system here.

449
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
I get my headphones.

450
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I want to start off the show.

451
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
So I've got my opening here.

452
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
My opening theme song, which is by Rachmaninoff.

453
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
And I cue a sweeper over that.

454
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
So I show you how that's done.

455
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
So basically, it's all in the fingers now.

456
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Pay attention, Zeener.

457
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
This is podcasting 101.

458
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
So I hit the space bar.

459
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
That starts to play.

460
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Then I hit the sweeper.

461
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,500
And so basically, I welcome everybody here.

462
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
So daily source code.

463
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
This is for Friday.

464
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
And here with the lovely Zeener Warrior Princess.

465
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
From the...

466
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
That's original.

467
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
You've never heard that one.

468
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,500
You don't even spell it the same way.

469
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
So basically, when I start off the show,

470
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm just using the keyboard for volume controls.

471
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Whereas in a radio studio, you probably have a sliding fader to...

472
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
The first that we put costing now.

473
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
So you're a podcast.

474
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
And you're a podcast.

475
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
And you're a podcast.

476
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
50,000 more or less.

477
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
So what's costing to 50,000?

478
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
At least.

479
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Yeah, sure.

480
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
At least.

481
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
And look at how easy it is.

482
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
It's completely simple.

483
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
So yeah, what I do is...

484
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I usually have a list here of stuff that I want to talk about.

485
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
And I talk about other podcasts.

486
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
But the great thing about this wireless microphone is that if I want,

487
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
you know, this I do this all the time.

488
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
We'll just...

489
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Step outside, you know.

490
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
And we'll...

491
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Well, now it's dark, of course.

492
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
But...

493
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
And it takes you outside of the whole idea of a studio.

494
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
And sometimes I just come out here and say,

495
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
let's just listen to the Belgian air for a moment.

496
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
And you hear the fountain in the background.

497
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I can hear the fountain in the background.

498
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
And it's really tranquil.

499
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
And then it's time to go play something to music.

500
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
But that...

501
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
But it can really...

502
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Literally be...

503
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Anyway, you like it.

504
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Yeah, whatever you want to do.

505
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I mean, I've done this while flying.

506
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I've done it while in my car.

507
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
And see what I do here is...

508
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
I remember I was...

509
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I was telling you about music, about music,

510
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
that we're allowed to play in our podcasts.

511
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
So something that people are playing a lot of right now,

512
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
is this guy named Brad Sox.

513
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
He's... he calls himself the one...

514
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
the one man banned with no fans.

515
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Which, of course, is funny, because he has lots of...

516
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
But he makes this all by himself on his computer.

517
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Yeah.

518
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
And so, you know, while we screw around here a little bit more,

519
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
we'll listen to a dirt bag.

520
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Brad Sox on the special BBC edition of the Daily Source Code.

521
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:27,500
It's a little bit hard on the stand.

522
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
But I don't want to be a part of it.

523
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
On the wire.

524
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
We're coming out soon.

525
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Just thinking about the one that got away.

526
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Nobody wanted me in my heart away.

527
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
You could make your mind up.

528
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
We could take a time.

529
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I know this thing.

530
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
You must take in me for some of my life.

531
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Here's our news to dirt bag.

532
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Under the weather.

533
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
And over a radius scene.

534
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
You must take in me for some of my life.

535
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Here's our news to dirt bag.

536
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Under the weather.

537
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
And over a radius.

538
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
And over a radius.

539
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And over a radius.

540
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
And over a radius.

541
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
And over a radius.

542
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
And over a radius.

543
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
And over a radius.

544
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
And over a radius.

545
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
And over a radius.

546
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
And over a radius.

547
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
And over a radius.

548
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
And over a radius.

549
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
And over a radius.

550
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
And over a radius.

551
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
And over a radius.

552
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
And over a radius.

553
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
And over a radius.

554
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
And over a radius.

555
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
And over a radius.

556
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
And over a radius.

557
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
And over a radius.

558
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
And over a radius.

559
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
And over a radius.

560
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
And over a radius.

561
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
And over a radius.

562
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
And over a radius.

563
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
And over a radius.

564
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
And over a radius.

565
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
And over a radius.

566
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
And over a radius.

567
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
And over a radius.

568
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
And over a radius.

569
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
And over a radius.

570
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
And over a radius.

571
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
And over a radius.

572
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
And over a radius.

573
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
And over a radius.

574
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
And over a radius.

575
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
And over a radius.

576
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
And over a radius.

577
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
And over a radius.

578
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
And over a radius.

579
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
And over a radius.

580
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
And over a radius.

581
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I think she'd run with a buzz and a fly-to-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

582
00:19:36,500 --> 00:20:06,500
o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-owo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

583
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:47,500
So, there's George Abbott School, which is where we really wanted to go, which is convenient.

584
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Yeah.

585
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Yeah.

586
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I mean, if it comes down to it, private school.

587
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah.

588
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Okay.

589
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
But it's on.

590
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
It's on the U.K. public school, private school.

591
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Yeah.

592
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
It's the other way around, right?

593
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Yeah, I know.

594
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Well, the same thing.

595
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Public school is the same.

596
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It's the perfect school.

597
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Right.

598
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
It's Comprehensive.

599
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Comprehensive.

600
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Comprehensive.

601
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
So, what?

602
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
So, are we in America or hear a call of public schools?

603
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Public schools.

604
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Comprehensive.

605
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Yeah.

606
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
But any of them private schools?

607
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Yeah.

608
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Public schools.

609
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Right.

610
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Okay.

611
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
So, a public school, a big, a public schools.

612
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
More famous ones are eaten.

613
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Right.

614
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Okay.

615
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Okay.

616
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Okay.

617
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
So, I guess this would be comprehensive, because...

618
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
It's the regular school.

619
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
There's three good schools right in the neighborhood.

620
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Right.

621
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Schools.

622
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah.

623
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
But getting her in is...

624
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Here in Holland is like, you know, well, we're filled up.

625
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
But, oh.

626
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh, Mr. Curry, Mr. Ms. Patricia.

627
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Yes.

628
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Well, no problem.

629
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
We'll hook you up there.

630
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
No one knows me.

631
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
No one knows me.

632
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
No one knows me.

633
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
No one knows me.

634
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
No one knows me.

635
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
No clue.

636
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Zero.

637
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I have no reputation there.

638
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Even if I had it, I don't think I would make any difference.

639
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
So, we just got to figure that out.

640
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
But there's lots of really good schools in that area.

641
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
It's a nice part of the country.

642
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Yeah.

643
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Totally, totally vibrant.

644
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm going.

645
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm so ready.

646
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Now, I've got to figure out this driving on the left hand side thing.

647
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
But...

648
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I can do it.

649
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Yeah.

650
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Yeah.

651
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
And...

652
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
It's funny money you got.

653
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
We've got funny money that I work on.

654
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Funny ways we're talking.

655
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
No, I like that.

656
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
The danger is...

657
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
This is the difference.

658
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
If you travel 45 miles...

659
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Oh, yeah.

660
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
You can completely change the experience.

661
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Sure.

662
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
The danger that I always find, particularly being American...

663
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Lots of English friends, is that before too long you slip into doing kind of like this

664
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
fucked up Madonna accent and then...

665
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
And I'm...

666
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
And you don't do it on purpose.

667
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
You know, you just...

668
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
It just kind of assumed these...

669
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Hello love.

670
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
And you say that.

671
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
And I know that the English people are going like,

672
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
She should be American shut up.

673
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
You know?

674
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
She should be saying bullets.

675
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
There's Madonna say bullets.

676
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Yes, she does.

677
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Now, she should be kicking the ballics for doing that.

678
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
I don't think it's possible.

679
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
You know, it should be flatter.

680
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
But I know that it irritates.

681
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
And so...

682
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
And I'm really worried about that because I know what happens.

683
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Yeah, I'm a sponge.

684
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I soak it up and I start...

685
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
And it starts with a few words.

686
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Before I come from it, it's the Shina Eastern factor.

687
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Shina Eastern is from Glasgow.

688
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Yeah.

689
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Gold love the woman.

690
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
But, you know, where she starts...

691
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
That may be the only person who loves her.

692
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Yeah.

693
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
But now she's like...

694
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
So many Atlantic skin.

695
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Right.

696
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Well, it's like listening to Tina Turner.

697
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
From it's conversely.

698
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Tina Turner is any may-ballock from, you know, from the south.

699
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
And he or going...

700
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Edward, no.

701
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I would like to do dedicated song, you know.

702
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
I know.

703
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Where the hell is this island thing come from, Tina?

704
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Yeah.

705
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
She's so kind of like...

706
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
She's the Swiss.

707
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
She's the Swiss.

708
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
She's the Swiss.

709
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Exactly.

710
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
She's the Swiss.

711
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
She's the Swiss.

712
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
She's the Swiss.

713
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
She's the Swiss.

714
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Exactly.

715
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
She's the Swiss.

716
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Mm-hmm.

717
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Well, she lives with her men, her German husband, her boyfriend.

718
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Yeah.

719
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
What's the name of the boy in the guy?

720
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
She actually has it.

721
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
You know, they all have this little set.

722
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
And they all drink sweet and clear.

723
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
It's podcasting.

724
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
All's live.

725
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Adam Curry.
