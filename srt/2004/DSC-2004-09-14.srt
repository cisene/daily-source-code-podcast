00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Hi everybody, welcome to the Source Code. I'm Adam Curry and good evening from

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's 9.30 p.m. on, what are we at?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Tuesday already, the 14th of September, 2004.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Of course, I want to welcome you if you're downloading this from live.curry.com.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You might be subscribing, you can find all the archives and of course ways to subscribe

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or just download Daily from DailySourceCode.com.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the place where you use this.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and had a lot of

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
yesterday. First of all, what I want to get to is I'm going to let you hear a little excerpt

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
from a special morning coffee notes that Dave Weiner did in Seattle probably, well, depending

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
on your viewpoint, even way after his morning coffee or only five or six hours before his

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
next morning coffee. And this was about what we were talking yesterday, where I was wondering

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
what all this geeky stuff is I'm hearing about ways to mount Gmail as a file system,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
use Gmail as an interface for a web blog, you know, you mail something to your Gmail account.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And my question was, is Gmail doing something special?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's some special APIs that I don't know about,

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
or what's going on?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It turns out, and Dave's going to explain this,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and I want to let you hear a good portion of how we responded,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which was great, because I don't think I could have

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
understood it if it was just written,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is that there really is no special API.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In fact, it's using stuff that's been around for a long,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
long time, only apparently it's never really been

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
interesting enough to use a free service until Gmail came

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
along, which means there's a whole gigabyte.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And with a gigabyte, arguably, that's

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
something you want to use as a resource,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but not necessarily for email.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You could use it to serve files from or create a web log.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So Dave actually gave a little explanation

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
about the APIs and how it works and what Google is

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
or isn't doing, but what developers are doing.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So check this out.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I just wanted to comment on one.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
One of the things that Adam talked about is that Gmail and whether there were more APIs

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
in there or not.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
What's really cool about what's going on with Gmail is that email is an API.

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
It's a very simple one.

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
It allows you to...

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,500
It's basically a flat directory of documents with enclosures.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,500
The body of the message and the title of the message can serve as metadata.

43
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,500
So can the sender of the message could be thought of as the creator of the document.

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Unix has a driver structure.

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:20,500
On the one hand, email either simply or pop is a good API.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Unix has an API for the file system and in fact, so does Windows.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And it allows you to put in drivers that basically do for the operating system the basic operations of creating a file, deleting a file, adding some text to the file, reading some text from a file or data from a file.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And there are a few more operations, but not that many.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Also operations that change the metadata, the data associated with files, the creation date, modification date.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the Macintosh you have a resource for.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm not sure if they have that anymore actually with OS 10 being a unit file system.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So in any case, Google didn't do anything new. They just supported an existing API that's very broadly understood and it's called Electronic Mail.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And that's the beauty of these formats and protocols.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They make.

55
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,500
both kinds of things possible. And the lowest common denominator, I mean Adam, you would

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:43,500
absolutely, I think you would love, you know, how simple these protocols are. They are,

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
they're all texts for us.

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
My thanks to, my thanks to Dave Weiner for explaining that. And of course I did look

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
into the world. I'm pretty sure.

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
having seen it before on the Unix command line.

61
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
And now I understand exactly what they're doing.

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,500
And that's why my conclusion is that it's really this one

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
gigabyte of free disk space that people are building

64
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
applications around.

65
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
That could be interesting to see where that takes us with

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Google in the future.

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,500
And also it kind of blew my mind that here we are creating

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
technology or implementing technology.

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
And we're basically doing the same thing over and over and

70
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
over again.

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
It's email or whether it's an iTunes, the way we're using

72
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
it now with iPodder to look for new stuff that has arrived.

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Or even a weblog.

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
It's all kind of the basic structure.

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
And now I'm also starting to understand outliners a little

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
bit better, at least what they can be used for and how

77
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
fantastic they really are.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Couple of other things I want to talk about.

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
And I will talk more about some technology stuff based

80
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
upon things that have been flying back and forth on the

81
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,500
iPod.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But today, as I check my download directory,

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I have on a server, I have a small program called Nucleus.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And you can just Google it.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You'll Google it with my name, and you'll find a link to it.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And Nucleus is a little Python script that runs.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have it running on OS X server, which is sitting

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
at my data center.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And it pulls an RSS feed from Supernova,

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
which has bit torrents.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And if it finds anything that matches a number of keywords

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
that I've put in there, it'll automatically download the bit

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
torrent file and then start up the download of the actual file.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it'll, it notifies me of something new has come in.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I have keywords in it like David Letterman, Leno.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think I've discussed this before.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Had all kinds of different keywords, some MTV stuff

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
like Pimp for Pimp My Ride.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That also picks up some interesting other torrents.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I have Michael Moore.

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
in there as a keyword because I'm always interested in seeing what he has to say and he's been

102
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,500
on different talk shows. And what that did for me is, lo and behold, I wound up this

103
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,500
morning with a full Divix copy of Fahrenheit 9-11, which I hadn't seen yet. So I spent

104
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,500
some time watching that today. And now I've heard all different kinds of reviews and

105
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
different thoughts about this. First of all, I was a little disappointed. I thought

106
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I was, you know, this is going to be some amazing editing job. And, you know,

107
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,500
anyone could have done this on Final Cut Pro and most of it was existing

108
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,500
footage. What I don't like, although I think, you know, it's great when you see

109
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
the footage that never airs, you know, when people are being made up, when

110
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
people are getting ready for camera to go on, particularly people that you only

111
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
see when the camera goes on. I love all that footage, which is also just

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,500
obtained from newsreels, news footage. I hate it, though, when, you know, there's

113
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
all this manipulation of...

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's editing all different types of sound bites and bits together for effect with music

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that is either dramatic.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know don't really need I just didn't need that part

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, that that was the part of the end like a little bit of entertainment show that I

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
credited what Michael Moore is trying to do with this documentary. Just as a minor example,

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
is when he talks about the coalition of the willing, which is the United States preparing

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to go into Iraq and we have a coalition of foreign countries that are going to help

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
us out. And then it's like one after another, it's like Morocco and all these countries

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that's made out not to matter. And the Netherlands also passes by. And when they're talking about

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the Netherlands in the movie, you see not a soldier, but you see someone just leaning forward,

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
lighting up a hash pipe. And you know, which is funny because I understand what's trying

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to be said there. However, having visited with the Dutch Marines in Asimallah in Iraq,

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
having lived with them for 10 days, doing a live broadcast, it felt a little shitty because

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I know those guys were there doing what they were doing.

128
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
were asked to do and they were very serious about their part of

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
contributing to rebuilding Iraq and this to me certainly having been there I

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
found a little bit demoralizing and it immediately gave me the feeling that you

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
know like hey even you know talking as a as a even though I have a US passport for

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
a second talking as a European like you know fuck you Michael Moore you know

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
we're two guys two of our guys died there and you know no one wrote about

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that in the American press you know we're not just a bunch of hash smoking

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
hippies you know we're pretty serious no way man I am a hash smoking hippie

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
anyway so I want to play a little bit I think this is probably the most important

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
bit from this from this movie if you haven't seen it it'll just be a quick

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
refresher where 9-11 has happened and everyone knows that Osama bin Laden has

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
claimed this we have to go after Osama bin Laden he's in Afghanistan we send 11,000

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
troops which turns out to be less than our police officers in Manhattan

141
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,500
And this is when the switch comes, when all of a sudden the administration started talking about Iraq and we got to go to Iraq and Iraq.

142
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I'll just stop this after a certain point.

143
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I don't want to play too much of it.

144
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
But this starts off with Richard Clark.

145
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,500
He's on, I guess, Good Morning America, and Charlie Gibbons is interviewing him.

146
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
And I'll let it play from there.

147
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Just so you can hear, this is the moment where the administration switched and where all

148
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,500
the bullshit started as far as I'm concerned for us to invade Iraq.

149
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,500
You come in September 12, ready to plot what response we take to al-Qaeda.

150
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Let me talk to the, about the response that you got from top administration

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
officials on that day.

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
What did the president say to you?

153
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,500
The president in a very intimidating way left us, me and my staff, with the clear

154
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
indication that he wanted us to come back with a word that there was an Iraqi hand

155
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,500
behind 9-11 because they had been planning to do something about Iraq from

156
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
before the time they came into office.

157
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Did he ask about any other nations other than Iraq?

158
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,500
No, no, no.

159
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
No, not at all.

160
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
It was Iraq, Saddam, find out, get back to me.

161
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
And were his questions more about Iraq than about al-Qaeda?

162
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Absolutely, absolutely.

163
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
He didn't ask me about it.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And the reaction you got that day from the Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, from his

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
assistant, Paul Woltholst.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, Donald Rumsfeld said when we talked about bombing the Al Qaeda infrastructure in Afghanistan,

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
he said there were no good targets in Afghanistan.

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's bomb Iraq.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And we said, but Iraq had nothing to do with this.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And that didn't seem to make much difference.

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And the reason they had to do Afghanistan first was it was obvious that Al Qaeda had

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
attacked us.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And it was obvious that Al Qaeda was in Afghanistan.

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The American people wouldn't have stood by if we had done nothing on Afghanistan.

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
OK, so here's one of those bits that I said that I really disliked where they're doing

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
a whole Bonanza montage, although very funny.

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let me just stop that, although very funny, totally unnecessary.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know, just make a documentary and let the funny bits be the irony of the subjects

179
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
of the documentary themselves.

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's the way I think it should be.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Anyway, moving along.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It was kind of depressing actually to watch that.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But Patricia came home, she was in Amsterdam.

184
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
preparing for a big fashion show this coming Sunday she's designed all the

185
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
makeup for the models and

186
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
and she said man you're really quiet and I have actually told her that I have it all

187
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
queued up and loaded on the

188
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,500
on the show server play out system on the big screen in the living room if she

189
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
wants to watch it because it did bump me on a little bit

190
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,500
uh... let's see from the mail bag I got a nice email from Doug Kay he's running

191
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
IT conversation

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Actually, I'm going to go to the site right now.

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yesterday, I was complaining that I couldn't get my fix of the Gilmore Gang and actually

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
started tweaking my aggregator thinking that was the problem.

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He sent a Mia Culpa email saying there wasn't a Gilmore Gang.

196
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He should have posted a note and he was going to do it ASAP and I'm just checking the

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
site now and there's no note still.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But that's what happened.

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hopefully Gilmore Gang will be back this coming Friday.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I look forward to it because it is one of my favorite programs that I got on the iPod.

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Now I started up the mailing list for the iPod developers which of course is

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
anything but exclusively for developers.

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
of introductions.

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and I have a link to the email list.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Anyone can join, please feel free to.

206
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's great to see all these different developers

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and users talking to each other.

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They've all got different ideas, functionality,

209
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
things that they're changing code.

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For instance, I'll just read one of these emails,

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
quickly just the introduction.

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
My name's Jonathan Green, while I'm not a developer,

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm an active user and thought out track

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
what's going on with developments in iPodder.

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And the first thing he says,

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
this is great as a user.

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He says, you know, still there's, you know,

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
there's a lot of trouble with setting up

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the schedule of iPodder so that it runs automatically.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And this is indeed, and there's been a couple more releases

221
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
of stuff, this is still not completely done.

222
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think that what I'd like, just speaking

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
from a Mac user perspective, is just giving one

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
of those disc images that opens up, you know,

225
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
so it looks like I'm installing something serious.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want to know about script.

227
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
And this should be maybe just an Apple script.

228
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
And you double click on that.

229
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
It stalls everything.

230
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You could make it call a crontab command line call

231
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
and add a line to it.

232
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
It should be relatively simple.

233
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
And that's really what the users are looking for.

234
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
I just want to put it in.

235
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I want to be able to forget about it.

236
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Let's see.

237
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,500
We got another email here from Pete who wrote Renko.

238
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Another enclosure extractor.

239
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Why don't I have this email here?

240
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Now, he's more a developer also talking about cront jobs

241
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
and how do we get stuff set up.

242
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
And he was thinking, why don't we connect it to the iCal?

243
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I think that the iPodder is something

244
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
that we want no glory on this.

245
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
We just want to install and run and for people

246
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
to forget about it.

247
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
There's this.

248
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Anything else would be too much.

249
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,500
And you can add features to it and do all kinds.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
of stuff but I think it has to be kept as simple as possible.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And the another interesting email that came through on the list is from Martin Fenroy.

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He is a part of the iSpider team and iSpider is a Python version of iPodder and they've

253
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
got it set up at SourceForge.

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So the URL is iSpider.SourceForge.net and they've got a great homepage, they've got a logo, they've

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
got it all set up.

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And I actually ran this version and although it hasn't installed script which installs everything

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
in the right place on Mac, you know, just give me please guys give me an Apple script to

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
double click on.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They've got some really cool additional features in this which are cool features though I

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
don't know if I necessarily agree with them.

261
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
First of all it's very elegant in the way it sets everything up and the way it moves stuff

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
over to iPodder.

263
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:02,500
It also runs on multiple platforms and by the time you're listening to this it should

264
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
also do Windows Media Play.

265
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it works with iTunes and with Windows Media Player and since it's Python it's cross-platform.

266
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But it does something else. It also has a screen scraper in there. This I thought was, at first

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I thought it was really cool because you can add a URL to an RSS 2.0 file with enclosures

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and it'll grab everything from that and place it accordingly in the playlist. Or you can

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
just give it a URL and it'll scrape the HTML code and any MP3 file it encounters it'll

270
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
download. And it's funny because I tried it out. I tried it out on, you know, I wanted to do something that would only have one or two files on it of not very large size.

271
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And so I did scripting.com because I knew that Dave had his morning coffee notes, just a four minute version on there, which I let you hit a little excerpt earlier.

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But what it also did is it came across a link to SourceForge from yesterday and said, oh, you know, here's an MP3 file.

273
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So it brought that one in as well, which could be a little bit confusing.

274
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Particularly on which playlist it has to go to, although in that particular case everything worked out fine.

275
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,500
But it's an excellent version of iPodder and I see a lot happening with that.

276
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,500
So iSpider.sourceforgedor.net and I'll also be adding that to the download directory.

277
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Okay, so much for the mailing list.

278
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
See, ran across, oh this was actually because of iSpider.

279
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:39,500
They had a couple additional feeds in their, what they're calling the favorites list,

280
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,500
which is basically the subscriptions that you download.

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And one of the sites which doesn't have an RSS 2.0 feed but does have a daily audio blog

282
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
is called Lenswork.com, L-E-N-S as in camera lens.

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And it's a guy named Brooke Johnson who sells his photography and he has some beautiful

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
pictures.

285
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But what he's doing in addition to that is he's maintaining a web blog and he's kind

286
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
of helping people out by talking along with different tips on photography, which

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I think is a great way to, you know, to, I think it's, it's really, it's a good

288
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
addition to what he's trying to get across this message with his photography

289
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and the fact that he wants you to pay like $99 for a print.

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And here's one of these blog posts.

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll just let you hear a little bit of it.

292
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I also think he has a great voice for this and the quality is just good.

293
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think it's something that is worth looking at.

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is an audio blog post titled Toys or Tools.

295
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
One of the consumers.

296
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,500
The most consistent themes that's come up in my recent conversations with photographers about their equipment choices

297
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,500
is the challenge that they have in taking digital photography seriously.

298
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Admittedly, because of my personal history in photography, a lot of my friends are large format photographers.

299
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
They're shooting 4x5s and 8x10 cameras.

300
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,500
And these are cameras that it's pretty easy to take seriously.

301
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
They're expensive, there's a lot of gadgets that have to be employed in order to use them successfully.

302
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
It's expensive to shoot sheet film, etc.

303
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:27,500
And somehow when these people pick up a digital camera, it just feels like a toy to them.

304
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Everything is automatic, focus is automatic, exposure is automatic, bracketing is automatic.

305
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
There's no film costs. They don't have to develop the film when they get home.

306
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
It just doesn't feel like a serious tool.

307
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,500
But yet, those people who are using these tools in a serious way are realizing that...

308
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that they can do some very nice photographs

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and some really interesting artwork.

310
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That leads me to think that when it comes to tools, it's not the nature of the tool

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that determines whether or not it's a serious tool.

312
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's the nature of the photographer's mind.

313
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If we approach the use of a tool in a serious way, if we approach it with a certain amount

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
of creativity, reverence, respect for what it can do, then it can be a serious tool.

315
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But if you insist that a toy is merely a toy and you don't approach it carefully

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and thoughtfully and deliberately, then a toy will be a toy and the results will be likewise.

317
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So that's something that all, everyone who works at a big co-publisher or media company

318
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
should listen to that at least twice a day.

319
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Because yeah, it's about the effort you put into these toys, but we're doing a lot of cool stuff.

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We've got web logs for publishing, we've got desks.

321
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,500
top publishing. We've got Final Cut Pro for video, we've got all types of different software

322
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
packages for audio, although not quite the one I'm looking for yet, but we're getting

323
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
there. That's Brooks Jensen. You can check out a new audio blog post. Looks like he's

324
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,500
doing them every single day at LensWork.com. Just a couple more things and I have a song

325
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
of the day for you. Still working on this new show that I want to launch.

326
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
this week or certainly beginning of next week for sure.

327
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
On the technology front, remember now what I want to do is I want to connect other people

328
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,500
over voice over IP so that I can have a conversation with them.

329
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Very much like the Gilmore Gang I guess, only, you know, talk about different things and

330
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
maybe only start off with one co-host.

331
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,500
But I don't want to have to resort to using a telephone and patching that into my computer.

332
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I should just be able to bring in a voice over IP call.

333
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,500
That works only what I'm trying to figure out now is how do I route audio both to

334
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,500
the recording side of recording a session on my laptop, excuse me, and also to the

335
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,500
voice over IP client and I think I'm going to use iChat AV.

336
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,500
I figured out that because for some miraculous reason Macintosh has something

337
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
called core audio which you can do all kinds of interesting things with and

338
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
there are a couple different programs I found we can actually patch the output

339
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
of one application to the input of another application.

340
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But it doesn't really work with, for instance, quick time, because that doesn't have a preference

341
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
setting for choosing the core audio drive or, you know, I'm probably digressing way too

342
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
far on this.

343
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But I'm getting close, because, you know, the final thing is if I play a clip, I want

344
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
the person on the other end or persons on the other end of the voiceover IP call, I

345
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
want them to be able to hear what I'm sending down the pipe or, you know, what's being

346
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
recorded.

347
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I actually got pretty far.

348
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was able to patch everything together, but then wiretap, which I'm using as the

349
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
recording device for all the audio, fails to work when you're patching audio through

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
with different applications.

351
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So there's some conflict there.

352
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So I'm still working on that.

353
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But hopefully I'll be able to get something up and running within the next

354
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
couple of days.

355
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And the song that I found, I can't remember if I found this on BlogDigger or

356
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
how I came about it.

357
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But it's a typical, you know, internet kind of spoofie, funny song.

358
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And it's a song of the time.

359
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
and I think you'll like it. It's called my JPEG baby.

360
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,500
GAME BACK! GAME BACK BABY! I REMEMBER WHEN I first came and I LOWED!

361
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Shake back, shake back

362
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and that's it for the source code for today as always if you want to leave a comment do
