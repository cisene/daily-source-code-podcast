00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Welcome to the podcast from the Kate and Jid is the daily source code this is where

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,720
users and developers party together hold on hold on I see you over there developer come on out come on join the party

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,080
you users over there on the left come on out on the dance floor

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:32,320
today is Wednesday it's December 1st 2004 we're supposed to say rabbit rabbit bunny bunny

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
whatever the heck it is it's supposed to bring you good luck and I wish all of that for all of you

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,600
coming to you from the United Kingdom where we're learning more about local culture every single day

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,360
this is your daily source code I'm Adam Curry it is seven minutes till 10 in the evening

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm still a bit behind on my production schedule that of course is because of the

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,800
complete lack of bandwidth more about that later on in the show because I do have some good news to

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:07,040
report when it comes to DS 3 letters of the album that are so important to me well that

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:18,400
and KLA I guess that's still important maybe see easy is one two three okay I kind of a

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,880
sad note to start off on for today's daily source code we've been waiting for it and then

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,120
I know that sounds kind of macabre but the Netherlands has been waiting for quite a while and finally

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:43,840
father of the Dutch Queen Beatrix died today at 93 we're an artist we know was diagnosed with cancer

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,920
in November last week tumors had spread to his stomach lungs causing a great difficulty with breathing

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,880
he'd really been on the edge of life for probably at least five to ten years so it wasn't

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,120
didn't come as a as a complete surprise but still very sad day and the whole country is in

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,920
mourning and the country has had a lot to mourn recently you know that of course the death of

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Theo von Hoch, the Dutch filmmaker before that two years ago Pimfortan politician in the meantime

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,880
close the the Queen's husband passed away and now her dad so she's also having she's not having

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,760
a very good year that's for sure and and Bernard was an interesting character I'll just tell you

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,920
a little bit about him that I know you probably heard of him in relation to the Lockheed scandal apparently

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,560
the allegation was that he took some kind of bribe to get Lockheed some business with the F-14 I

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,920
think it was and he took a million dollar bribe but I'm not too sure if that was ever successfully

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,200
proven and and what exactly that was about I certainly don't think he needed a million dollars I

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:04,000
think the royal family is wealthy enough the prince set up the world wildlife fund and that you know

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,840
the you probably recognize the logo by the panda bear so he's done a lot of work with that he

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,040
also was one of the founders of the building bird group I think he might have had something

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,200
to do with the Paris club as well very very influential on the on the young the huge

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:28,560
uber scale of money in the world and the prince always wore an orange flower a red flower I'm

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,000
sorry was it red flower no white flower a white flower there you go god I really I really know

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,040
what I'm talking about and rumor has a religion has it that he also drank a glass of honey

33
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,200
can beer every single morning for breakfast of course it being a fine-dutch product but he also

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,080
said that it really got him going was very healthy to have a glass of beer one glass of beer in the

35
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,080
morning at breakfast or maybe just after breakfast any loved his cars he had Ferrari's lots of

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,520
Ferrari's later in his life he didn't drive himself but he'd have his driver drive his Ferrari and

37
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,560
it's it next to him and he was rumored to have women all over the world and a couple of village

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,880
other illegitimate children you know exactly what you want from your prince you know he was in

39
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:18,080
all I think was really cool and we will certainly certainly miss him on the on the political

40
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,640
and on the royalty scene as well okay moving right along from death let's go on to what happened this

41
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,840
morning nine o'clock my phone started ringing and it was the BBC I guess my number is now

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,360
known at the BBC and so anyone who works at the BBC gives me a call this was lovely lady from

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,200
BBC world now I used to listen to the world service all the time when I was especially when I was

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,680
commuting back and forth between Belgium and and the Netherlands the radio studio in the morning

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
I really like to listen to it and it has an incredible reach the entire world does literally

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,280
tune into the BBC world service and so they said well we want to do a segment on podcasting

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,280
and we'd like to do that at 12 25 this morning like okay so who dropped out you know who couldn't

48
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,080
make it no no no this will be perfect and you know whatever so I said well you know I can call

49
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,520
in or whatever you said oh no we have a studio and gilford of course you do so even though

50
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,200
their main studios in London they have a studio which is actually a part of the BBC SCR which is

51
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,400
South Coast radio learned about that yesterday as I got a little education on the FM dial that I

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,080
had scanned and they do have a studio right on the campus of Surrey University and so she said oh I

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
have a card pick you up and the car was going to come at a quarter to 12 excuse me I'm a

54
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:50,800
one a day remember there we go so the car was going to come pick me up at a quarter to 12

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,920
like 10 after 12 I figured I'm going to call and and Marion called me and said no well the

56
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,600
driver's sitting outside your house said no he's not wrong address you figured it out so

57
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,360
finally what happens is you know real nice guy cab driver races you know off with me to get to

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,120
the studio on time get into the studio do the thing do a live bit it was good you know the basic

59
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,960
simple questions what is podcasting where is it going what do you think blah blah so did that bit

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,960
and then waited around a little bit for a car to drive me back and I was back around 115 and

61
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,120
that was just the beginning of the day then I helped Patricia we cleared out the dining room which

62
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,520
was basically filled with paintings had to put all of those up in the attic because we just don't

63
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,520
have enough space for all of our collection so we we've made some choices what we're going to hang

64
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,400
up in the cottage so spent a lot of time moving stuff up from downstairs up to the attic taking

65
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,680
stuff out to the garage tonight by the way is trash night kind of another humongous load which

66
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,120
have to separate between cardboard and all the other stuff so I'm going to do that before I hit the

67
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,560
hay and actually started putting some of the paintings up which meant one or two holes that

68
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,040
needed to be drilled and I'm really not good at this I can do it I guess but we're getting close we're

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,920
getting very close to making this extremely livable I'm really happy about that nice cup of tea

70
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,040
a lot of people mess about my mom and how she's been doing and I realized that I haven't really

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
given an update in a while I've given people updates privately who asked about it who inquired

72
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,320
and so we've been through all the tests and two weeks ago the final test were done and it turns out

73
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,440
my mom is a perfect candidate for an operation so there's no spread of the disease it's

74
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,680
all still in the lower portion of her lung the doctors feel confident they can do with removing half

75
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,320
of her lung but at this point they basically say well if you wake up and you have one tube sticking

76
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,200
out of you we removed half along if it's two tubes we removed a full lung either way she'll be able

77
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:06,640
to live on and and function on one lung if necessary in the lung cancer world this is really

78
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,560
really good news and we're extremely happy now we're just waiting for the spot in line

79
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,760
for you know I guess basically I'm going to call up two days before before she can go in

80
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,080
for the operation so we're all kind of waiting for that and there are the people who have you know

81
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,320
who need you know I have priority I need to go ahead of her we're still hoping that'll happen

82
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,840
before Christmas so we are looking forward to that thank you all so much once again for all your

83

90
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,480
for big Dave Jacobs our love thoughts go out to you and I heard a speaking of Dave winters

91
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,400
I heard his morning coffee notes boy Dave has a lost his voice it was so cool for him to do

92
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,800
from the do a podcast regardless of him losing his voice I encourage you to listen to this if

93
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,360
you're a user or developer which means everyone listening to this show should listen to that

94
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,480
morning coffee notes all I mean just put a link to that right now so you know where to get that online

95
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,320
I'm doing that in my production show show notes so you'll be able to click right on it and get

96
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,360
morning coffee notes for December 1st 2004

97
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
So listen to that because it's a lot about being a developer being a user and how do we party together

98
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,400
at the end Dave put in a nice special message for me which I'll never buddy ever Bob

99
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,000
This was for you Adam it's it's what's 16 minutes into it and

100
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,040
you could probably get yourself to Starbucks in the time it takes you listen to this thing maybe less

101
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,040
Anyway, I just actually want to add that one out one note is that boy do we miss you Adam

104
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:50,400
my very good friends Don Andrew going on who are I just love both of them to piece I think

105
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,440
they're the greatest people in the world and you know I don't care even if she is bitchy

106
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,800
even if she is bitchy stay away from my woman whina still my favorite anyway

107
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,440
Alright thank you Dave and actually I saw that you've done the morning coffee notes

108
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
I didn't have time to get the Starbucks today so Patricia I went out for dinner and I just

109
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,440
threw on the uh the modem and downloaded the all seven megs while we were out to dinner and it was

110
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,840
there sitting for me when I got back so here's the good news tomorrow Ben with arrives at the

111
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,720
cottage today special delivery my ADSL modem showed up it's a beautiful 56 megabyte

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,680
per second wireless router plugged it in of course the DSL light was flashing meaning there was no

113
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
DSL service I gave the guys a call they said no problem tomorrow they kicked the switch

114
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,280
in the exchange and everything should be working no more intervention is needed your DSL line should

115
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,040
stop flashing and then you'll be up and rolling I did not by the way go with BT with British telecom

116
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm not going to tell you who I went with yet the reason I didn't go with BT is because they still

117
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,480
have a uh a bandwidth cap 30 or not just bandwidth traffic actual data limit so there's 30

118
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,280
gigabytes per month and that's it and I'm like new bin down that road don't want to witness that again

119
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
I asked them I said are you sure you don't have any other kind of package no so there were a couple

120
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:22,080
of other providers providing good speeds and unlimited unmetored bandwidth so I went with one of those

121
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,760
so far so good everything seems to be doing okay tomorrow hopefully everything will just magically

122
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,840
pop on it'll all work and I'll be back um because and it's funny because I talked a

123
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,280
day about this before you know I said I'm hurting so bad you know with with the bandwidth because

124
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,320
just your life slows down to a tenth of the speed that you had forget uploading and downloading

125
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,920
podcasts I mean that's virtually impossible email attachments uh just you know ordering uh playing tickets

126
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,600
or hotel room everything takes so much longer it's just it's excruciating and Dave said

127
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,680
hey ma'am we are hurting along with you and I thought and said you know fuck it's true it is we're all

128
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,400
hurting you know I need my Skype calls and I need to be back in touch so tomorrow and I think still

129
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:14,160
we did a pretty good job within two weeks of getting uh phone line because I had I went from zero to

130
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,800
to DSL if we can get everything right and then Saturday the uh satellite guys show up I've ordered

131
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,240
a couple of sky boxes uh including the one with the digital hard drive uh primarily so we can get

132
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,200
our teenage daughter out of the living room with the only TV is right now with that free view box

133
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
lover to death but we've got you know she and she needs to have her own spot too you know

134
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,200
wish you she likes to sit in front of the TV watch corang TV or MTV or whatever other uh music

135
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,400
television she usually watches and then she wants to be on her laptop sit there on MSN chatting with her

136
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,960
with her friends you know and and then SMSing messages back and forth on the cell phones that's what

137
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,360
they do so gotta get that set up so that should be done by Saturday and then we're pretty good

138
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,720
you know got my credit cards uh local bank accounts uh actually paid my uh my phone bill online today

139
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,080
we have uh we're setting up our life and it feels really really good um and it'll be even better

140
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,520
when we have all of the the bandwidth we need coming in which also means by the way that uh we

141
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,520
get our phone line back because it's tough man sharing one phone line between two people who want

142
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,560
to be in the internet and you know people who want to call us and uh Patricia wants to call and

143
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,680
it gets expensive just doing on a cell phones even though there's not that much price difference anymore

144
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,720
and by the way I can't wait to use my Skype out account again because you know that's the cheapest

145
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
the cheapest way uh to make any kind of phone call and the quality is great and I'm just

146
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,760
things are looking up I'm really happy about that and I got an email as we continue to learn more

147
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:52,240
about the UK culture and inventions uh comment from anonymous connect anonymous connect says

148
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,840
Alexander Bell was born and mostly educated in Scotland before briefly living in Canada

149
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,200
he moved to the states when he was 20 through 23 and as you can see from his page on uh uh the

150
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,040
mother corps website here in Canada it is said that he dreamed up the telephone in Canada

151
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,960
and then constructed it in the states so here we have so we have uh uh all three nations have

152
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,920
some claim to Alexander Graham Bell uh depends of course you're talking to educated in Scotland

153
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,800
inspired in Canada empowered in the United States interesting isn't it history and how one

154
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,280
person's history doesn't necessarily have to be the other person's history got a Skype call from

155
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,760
Lee Wilkins yesterday uh the Jenny and Lee show Jenny and Lee uh the Jenny and Lee show dot com I

156
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,360
think is there a podcast a website address and he contacted me through Skype and then through cell

157
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,840
phone then he had a real horrible story just a sob story about his wife Jenny and him and uh and

158
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,200
their dogs and moving back and forth and uh it's it's a horrible story where you know the company

159
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,040
he was working for moved into the states and then within a week they had to move back because it

160
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,680
wasn't working out or something had gone wrong and because they had moved their dogs out they couldn't

161
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,760
move them back in because they didn't have the rabies shot so the dogs are now stuck somewhere in

162
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:17,120
Atlanta they have to have the dogs flown in from Atlanta because Atlanta or Delta messed up the

163
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,040
flights then they go into quarantine for six months so I wanted to get Lee on Skype and talk to

164
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,920
him about it and see if uh the podcasts community might want to help out and shipping a little bit

165
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,640
because they're really I mean I know how they feel because we had at least we had the same scare you know

166
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,640
that uh that are dogs and cats we have to go into quarantine uh but now Lee can't even get his

167
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,120
animals back from and they're they're little uh Jack Russell Terriers oh man they're so cute

168
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,880
and they're in Atlanta somewhere so I'm going to oops sorry about that don't hit the microphone

169
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,040
it sounds really unprofessional um I'll uh when I've been with Tomar I'm going to get Lee on Skype

170
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,640
and we'll get the whole story yes they also talked about um one of the problems that I'm

171
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,000
seeing with the iPod or at least the problem is kind of the vacation button um where

172
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,600
if you've been away or haven't you know been up to haven't been able to suck in your current

173
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,200
subscriptions or like me you've been van with challenged you know what you don't want is to reconnect

174
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,640
and then um basically the scan takes so long because it won't just bring in the latest dawn

175
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,240
and drew show it brings in every single dawn and drew show that I've missed in that period that

176
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,560
I've been gone and uh I was thinking that we need some kind of functionality for that and then I got an

177
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,440
email from um from Arabic and I've put this into the pod show notes even though it's in Dutch

178
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,400
someone might have appreciated um everyone is uh one of the creators of Doppler Doppler 1.1 and uh

179
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:55,360
he says that on Doppler if you right click on a feed you can select uh a contextual menu called

180
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:04,320
catch up catch up see a TCH space up so not catch up but catch up catch up uh and then what it does

181
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,120
is it adds every enclosure into the download history but without actually downloading it so you can

182
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,560
go back and download those download those later but basically you say you know catch up skip everything

183
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,560
but remember that you didn't actually download it but pretend like you didn't download it for now so

184
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,200
you can just get the latest stories and that's great of course Doppler uh only works on Windows

185
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,520
which is uh a bummer but uh I think there's some uh some art to look for there that uh that is useful

186
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,240
for other iPodders because you know what people do eventually go on vacation and we've got a big

187
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,280
one coming up Christmas holidays so we don't want to have people you know breaking their uh

188
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,240
their hard drives with you know by reconnecting and having to suck in all this stuff and and really

189
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,280
losing a lot of the benefit of what iPodder brings to the table and now um a little bit from uh

190
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,040
Ray was a witch was a witch was a witch not me to only got an eye neither of us can pronounce

play for you i do want to continue with um my uh British uh for americans uh where we left off

212
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:22,320
yesterday was the arse about face um obviously there's a couple more arse uh pronunciations

213
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,080
or uh saying that they have here in the UK arse over elbow is one another way of saying head over

214
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,200
heels but a little more descriptive usually happens after 11pm on a Saturday night after too many

215
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,680
beers um i guess what we'd say in the states is arse over tea kettle arse over tit another version

216
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,360
of arse over elbow but a bit more graphic and forbidden during a super bowl show arse hole

217
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,920
asshole to you not very nice in either american english or british english arse hold uh what does

218
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,880
that mean it means drunk usually in the advanced stages of a drunk and stupor so it would be

219
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,600
be considered completely arse hold um let's see what is the next one we're still on a man how do you

220
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,200

221
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,400
middle of light i would say i'll have one as well people usually just say as well okay so that's uh

I'm Trishipai, and mumbo, it's me, I know, on the daily source code

319
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
For Wednesday, the first episode

320
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,240
And I still owe you a complete list of all the musicians that played on that track

321
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,240
Because not a single sample machine was used

322
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Well, of course, they used that in the mix

323
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,240
But it was all live musicians playing live

324
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Horns, live drums, the whole nine yards

325
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
You can tell the difference, can you?

326
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Alright, that's gonna do it for the source code

327
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,240
For today, hopefully tomorrow we'll have the fully enabled broad band edition
