1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The Power of Dark.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Coming to you, Dritz.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
From Curry Castle in Belgium, it is...

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
The power of your influence.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
I've got a lot lined up for you today.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
In fact, today is a special day because if everything works out with the technology in,

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
then I'll be recording the new show that I've been teasing in the past week.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
It's a show with a co-host.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
And I actually tested out some of the technology locally here today.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
And it works.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Looks like I'm going to be able to record both of us,

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
almost as if we're sitting in the same room.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Although, believe me, there's no one else here in Belgium

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
I would want to do that show with.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
So first, that's clearly somewhere else.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
And we've got a name.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
We're working on a tune.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
And today we're going to record.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
And if it turns out OK, then we broadcast it.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
But basically, this will be a show.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and we talk for however long it is, no longer than an hour, certainly, and then we end it.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Anyway, this is the source code, something completely different.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's where users and developers party together, and if you've ever seen my weblog at curry.com,

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
then you've probably seen the title of my weblog, it wasn't say Adam Curry's weblog,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but underneath it says, there are no secrets, only information you don't yet have.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And boy, that really came true.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yesterday here in the Netherlands, a respected news organization, RTL News,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
announced that they had obtained the national budget,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
let's see, three days before its embargoed release to the press.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the way this works here, we have what they call Prince Day, Princeius Dach,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and that's the third Thursday in September,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and that's when the Minister of Finance presents, he has a little briefcase actually that says

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Thursday in September he presents the budget, the budget for the coming fiscal year and

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,500
the Queen does her annual how-to-do and she talks about, it's basically a state of the

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,500
union or a state of the kingdom address and RTL News somehow obtained the entire document

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,500
so which basically says, you know, here's what the minister of economics is planning

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
on doing and here's what the government is planning on doing in 2005, giving of

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,500
course everybody kind of a head start, a weird head start since you're not really

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,500
supposed to hear this until everybody hears it on Thursday but then again, you

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,500
know, there's no secrets, right? And it's, I think it's going to cause quite a stir.

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,500
I also think it's pretty unbelievable that even though the press got a hold of

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,500
it and they really didn't even discuss much in the in the documents on the

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
RTL News, they said, hey, here it is, they did, they made it available via

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
download on their website which almost impossible to get because it would just

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
got totally swamped and

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They didn't really discuss much of the content. It seemed like the scoop of them having it.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The fact that someone had leaked that to them was the story all by itself and what almost went

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
unnoticed is what's in the budget. By the way, not really good. Let me see. Oh, yes. Slash.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Pointed to ipodder.org yesterday. Now the correct verbiage I believe is that I was slash.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or we were slash dotted ipodder.org. This happened to me I think once, maybe twice before.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And it's really fun because you notice it. Your email starts pinging with all kinds of people

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
responding to whatever the site that's linked to. Sometimes you get all kinds of messages that

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
your servers are burning out and running down. Now in this case, I have to say the load was not

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
on me because ipodder.org is actually hosted by Radio Userland when you buy Radio Userland.

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
You get, I think it was $35 a year.

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You get an annual license for radio user land

57
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
and all their updates.

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
And you get storage.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
And I think I've purchased additional storage,

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,500
but you get a certain number of MEGs that you can use.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
And since iPod.org, I just kind of routed that as a category

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
for my web blog.

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
By default, it goes to the user land server

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
and it held up beautifully.

65
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
So thank you very much user land.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,500
May I say, well worth the price of admission for that service.

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I didn't go unnoticed by some of the other folks

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
who were working on iPod.org and on programs

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
and shows of their own.

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Dave Slusher, who brings you the evil genius Chronicles,

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
noticed that iPod.org got slash dotted.

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
And he had some remarks about it,

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
which I thought were pretty funny and some things

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
that I also noticed as well.

75
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm going to play a bit of Dave's audio blog,

76
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
or actually his show from yesterday,

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
which was titled Mr. Microphone.

78
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
We're going to skip the Mr. Microphone.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and listen to him about slash dot what he feels about it.

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,500
slash dot is what it is in general. It's interesting. So here's Dave Slasher from evilgeniuschronicles.org.

81
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Today, the iPodder link was slash dotted. And you know, I used to read slash dot a lot,

82
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,500
and I just kind of stopped. And for a similar reason that I've actually considered stopping

83
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,500
reading boing boing, which is that all the really good stuff that I care about comes

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,500
in from either was from other sources that I already read before it was there,

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,500
or somebody's going to post a pointer to it. And both of them have a lot of crap that I just could not give a shit about if I tried.

86
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,500
You know, on boing boing, it's, you know, Cory Doctro, God love him, great guy, great writer.

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Man, if I see another post about Disney, I am just going to vomit Mickey Mouse ears.

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
You know, I don't give a shit about Disney. And I especially don't care, you know,

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
I post seven posts every day about Disney and Disney World and Roy Disney and Michael Eisner.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Who gives a fuck? Fuck this.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Disney. So, you know, and so, you know, if I were in like, Jenny Jordan or however you

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
pronounce her name, you know, robots and objects shaped like Hello Kitty, you know, after a

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
while, Jesus Christ, how many things can be, you would assume that eventually Sanrio will

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
shape everything, including, you know, enema balls, be like the, you know, the Choco

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Cat enema ball. So, after a while, the novelty is not there anymore. Now, were

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I a boing-boing contributor, everyone would get sick of seeing more like

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mexican wrestling stuff, you know. No one else cares as much about your fetishes.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's the nature of the fetish. But I get tired of it. And same thing with

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Slash. After with Slash. It's mainly the commenters. And the only reason I ever

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
got a Slash. account in the first time, because I really don't care that much.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I once cared and I just stopped. So that I can log in to my account and

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
then just put the comment threshold up to five. And often I don't, I just

103
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
go out of my way to not even scroll down low enough to see the comments.

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,500
And if you look at the comments that are kind of on that iPod or post,

105
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
it is prototypical for the horseshit.

106
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,500
It just makes me not care anything about slash dot comments

107
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,500
because you could easily machine generate all the threads on there.

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You have like a probabilistic script that will say,

109
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
okay, certain percent will say, that's already been done.

110
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Certain percent will say, is that all there is?

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
And a certain percent will make stupid jokes about something

112
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
and a few will be completely unrelated.

113
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And a few will tell other people what an asshole they are for thinking this.

114
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
It's just nothing to it.

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,500
If that was the only thing I knew about online communities

116
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
was slash dot comment threads,

117
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
I would think that was the worst shit in the world.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Why does everybody talk about this? This is nothing.

119
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
So it's amazing to me.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The kind of, it seems like, you know, I don't know what percentage of people actually leave comments.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm guessing probably, you know, 0.1%.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Almost everybody reads and probably very few people leave the comments.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So you kind of self-selected for a certain kind of person.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And that kind of person, one is kind of an asshole.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And two, has really bad reading comprehension.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't know why everyone on there, for like the first 100 comments, seems to think

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the iPod has something to do with streaming, either outputting streaming or reading in streaming,

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
when that's sort of not quite the opposite, but almost the opposite of what it's really about.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's not about streaming.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So that was something.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And I just hope the slash dot storm, you know, doesn't kill Adam's bandwidth on it.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hopefully, you know, the fraction of people who are actually interested will kind of stick around

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and the assholes will move on, as assholes do.

134
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,500
As I said, Bandwidth wasn't too bad on my end because I paid my $35 and I got a good deal

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
out of it.

136
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,500
But indeed, it's funny because I was talking to Dave Weiner a couple days ago about, I

137
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
don't know how we got to talking about it.

138
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I said, you know, it's so hard, often to be taken seriously.

139
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
This by the way is, you know, don't cue any violins for me.

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Oh, wait a minute, maybe we should.

141
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
That'd be kind of cool.

142
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Hold on a second.

143
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Let me see.

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
I wonder if I have any violins.

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
When it hun.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Thank you.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you very much.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Nice cup of tea.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
from my wife.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Uh, let me see.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I've got some.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do I have any violins?

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come on.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Give me some violins.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How about...

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So...

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's not sad enough.

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's try this one.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So whenever...

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I try to post something seriously, it...

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I just don't get taken seriously.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Did I still talk about my...

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What the Queen?

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Downtown Julie Brown.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Enough of that.

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
OK, looking at the iPodder developer mailing list,

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
which is great because this is anything but a developer

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
mailing list.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's for developers and users.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And because of the slash dot link,

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
a lot of people have been catching on to what we're doing.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And one thing that says a lot of talk about within the

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
iPodder community is about screen scraping.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And part of this is due to, I guess, is iSpider.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I think it's the iSpider program that will allow you

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to subscribe to RSS 2.0 files with enclosures.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But also, if you just give it a URL,

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
we'll scrape that, the HTML, and we'll

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
download any MP3 that's attached to it.

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And Dennis, who has a great site called scrapfeeds.com,

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
which for RSS is absolutely fantastic if a site doesn't

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
support it but you do want to subscribe to it.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He's also jumped into the conversation.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I have to say, I'm not for the screen scraping.

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think it's great.

186
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
People talk about how you can do it with.

187
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Excuse me, regular expressions and therefore also download other files except for mp3s

188
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
that are on a web page.

189
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
But that's kind of beyond the point.

190
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Then we should call this ice scraper.

191
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,500
The whole point is that you get something that you know is going to be there, it's

192
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
going to be there more or less consistently as long as you're subscribed and consistency

193
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
depends upon the published times and dates.

194
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,500
But for serendipity maybe, just to have a feed of stuff like the blog digger feed,

195
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
that's fine.

196
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I love getting stuff just kind of out of the blue.

197
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,500
But I think the whole point is we have to get the solid base down first of subscribing

198
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
to RSS 2.0 files with enclosures.

199
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Or any, if Adam is out there, ATOM and they have enclosures, we're going to have to

200
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
support that as well.

201
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I think that's where we need to support to start.

202
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Something else that I think is great, I forget who mentioned this, but OPML support.

203
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
And I think this is probably

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the perfect way to deal with the subscriptions because we kind of been and I think you know

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
also this has been tried right you know the with web blogs the little orange white on

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
orange XML icons it's not going to get much easier than you know the way we do it now

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
by just having a feeds dot text file or whatever and adding a an RSS URL to an RSS and that

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
file however if we have OPML that could be interesting because with OPML then you

209
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
can read in collections of

210
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
subscriptions and you could also open up that

211
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,500
OPML file in an outliner. It should be any outliner that supports it

212
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,500
but you know there are a lot of good ones out there that already support OPML.

213
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
You can easily manage your subscription. So I think that's something good that we

214
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
should be looking at.

215
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
And I got an email. Let's see. This is from Andrew Clark.

216
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,500
See where's Andrew from? I don't remember. He's talking about

217
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,500
the long-term of actually starts off by saying I think in the long-term

218
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
storing MP3s in a web server won't really scale. He's done the math and he says my

219
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,500
daily source code MP3 is already total 438 megabytes for just one month of shows.

220
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I don't know if I've been at it for a whole month, maybe half a month.

221
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
And he says well sure that's not a problem for Adam but it may be for a lot of people.

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
So what he eventually winds up saying is you know this is and by the way I

223
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
don't think the storage is a problem because even if you're using BitTorrent

224
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
which is what he leads up to.

225
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
You're still going to need the storage, whether that's locally or on a server.

226
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Granted, most people don't have the luxury of a server sitting somewhere with just gobs

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,500
of gigs laying around to be filled up.

228
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,500
This is definitely a problem and I think BitTorrent is indeed the way to go.

229
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,500
So the next step is how do we publish RSS files and their enclosures?

230
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
What do we put in the BitTorrents?

231
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,500
How do we get it from A to B?

232
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,500
That's a really big step that we have to take because it's not the storage that necessarily

233
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
is the problem.

234
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
It's the bandwidth.

235
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
You don't want to know what kind of bandwidth I'm pushing.

236
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
It's unbelievable, especially after the iPod or slash dot.

237
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,500
A lot of people start listening to the source code and every single time someone fires

238
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,500
up a new install of iPod or boom, they're going to get 10 of my files.

239
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,500
So that's roughly around 200 to 300 megs.

240
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
So you can do the math on that.

241
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Obviously that's not going to scale.

242
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think BitTorrent is totally the way to go.

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So I'm looking forward to anyone integrating

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
any type of BitTorrent functionality into an iPodder.

245
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And I bet you there's someone out there

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
who knows just how to do it.

247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
A little bit of politics on the source code for today

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
is we're 15 minutes into the show,

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
really based upon two pieces of audio

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that I want you to hear.

251
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's about Bush.

252
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And the first bit that I'm going to play for you,

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
about three minutes.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And the great thing about the show, of course,

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
or any show within the iPod platform

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is if you don't like what you're hearing,

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you just skip ahead, right?

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's just like Tevo, real simple.

259
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I think you'll be pretty enthralled to listen to this.

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a BBC radio documentary.

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now, I listen to the BBC World almost all the time.

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We get it on AM, or you can get it on AM

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in almost all of Europe.

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I think you can get it online.

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can listen to them as well, bbcworld.com.

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You think it would be .co.uk, but it's bbcworld.com.

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And they do great.

268
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I mean, just phenomenal documentaries.

269
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
And this is one of their radio documentary series.

270
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
And it's about the Skull and Crossbones Club.

271
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
I guess it's a fraternity at Yale.

272
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,500
And the reason for them to go find out about the Skull and Crossbones Club is because three

273
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
of the past four presidents were members of the Skull and Crossbones.

274
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,500
So that would be George Bush Sr., Jr. and John Kerry.

275
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,500
So if he's elected, of course, then, oh, wait, that was presumptuous of me.

276
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,500
And so this reporter took a little trip out to the Skull and Crossbones headquarters and

277
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,500
spoke with some people there and actually walked up to the door and just gives a little

278
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,500
bit of insight about this very, very secretive organization and what's behind it.

279
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Now what I need to do is figure out where this came from because it is from the BBC.

280
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
I know that, but it was delivered, how do I find it?

281
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Probably another blog digger score.

282
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
So I don't feel comfortable just republishing it in its entirety.

283
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
It's about 28 minutes long.

284
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So you'll have to hunt around for it.

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But it was apparently released on the 12th of September 2004.

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's called Scullin Crossbones.

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Listen to this piece.

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think you'll enjoy it.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
My search for the secrets of Scullin bones begins on a wet spring afternoon on the Yale

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
campus.

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
My guide is Peggy Adler, a tenacious researcher who helped investigate the Iran Contra scandal

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
in the 1980s and has been probing into Scullin bones for almost 20 years.

293
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We're on the way, Scullin bones headquarters intriguingly named Tomb on one of Yale's main

294
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
thoroughfares.

295
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So this is on the left.

296
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's right.

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I see white smoke too.

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's like smoke.

299
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I mean it seems very appropriate weather that we're in the middle of this storm.

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's thunder every now and then.

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Look at this building which does look, it's quite an imposing, quite a dark looking

302
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
building isn't it?

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Right in the middle of the campus.

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Should we take a closer look?

305
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You can if you want.

306
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Yeah.

307
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I'll stay here.

308
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Why don't you want to come up?

309
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I just feel that since I live locally and continue to be cited in articles by name that I'll

310
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
just stay on the side of the street.

311
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
You don't want to come up there and knock on the door?

312
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Oh no no no.

313
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Wish me luck.

314
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Good luck.

315
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,500
It's Sunday when the 15 members of Scullum Bones normally meet and it's their last

316
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
chance before the university breaks up for the summer.

317
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,500
We waited for the chance to see the Bonesmen and ask them what actually goes on inside

318
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
and there was an added attraction.

319
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Pop Bonesmen was in town.

320
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Another and George W. Bush here for his daughter's graduation the next day.

321
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Okay well I'm just going to go inside.

322
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Well close like hand to the two.

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Just coming up these steps and there are these huge double black doors that must be

324
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:26,500
about 15 feet high surrounded by concrete pillars and then there's two big padlocks.

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
obviously saying.

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Have a check.

327
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They are definitely not.

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There's no way of getting in here.

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm not going to do anything.

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not going to do anything.

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm not going to do anything.

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The building is hard to miss, a 50 foot high windowless mausoleum of grey stones squatting

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
in the middle of Yale's campus.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The rules of the club forbid any non-member from ever going inside, but Peggy's come pretty

335
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
close. She was part of a team that successfully recorded part of the initiation ceremony that

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
takes place in the tombs courtyard.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay, you have the doorway here. Then to the right you have a hedge and then you have an

338
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
evergreen tree. If you follow that line straight back, courtyard's in there.

339
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So that's where they have the ceremonies in the courtyard.

340
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The outdoor part of it, part of it was indoor. So we only got to see the outdoor part.

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We only got to listen to the outdoor part. God only knows what went on indoors.

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And what did you hear? What was it? You know you managed to

343
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
forget this unique access. Oh, it was disgusting. It was rough. I mean, they were pretending

344
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,500
to murder people. What was the tone of it though? Was it, was it joky or is this one?

345
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
It was just, no. It wasn't joky at all. It was, it was sick. But they only could describe

346
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
it, it was sick.

347
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,500
What you're hearing is the first recording ever made of the Scullum Bones initiation ceremony.

348
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
It has never been broadcast before.

349
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
15 new members of the club.

350
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Okay, I'm going to stop this bit here.

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So, fascinating stuff to listen to.

352
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Although, I have to be honest.

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, first of all, isn't it great the way the BBC does this?

354
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You know, it's a beautiful accent.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The Schollenberg Club on the Yale campus.

356
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's just, oh man, could you read the phone book for me

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and just let me listen to it?

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That'll be nice. An audio book or the phone book

359
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
done in proper English. That'll be very nice.

360
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So, it's a good listen if you can find it.

361
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll see if I can find a place to point to it on my web blog, obviously.

362
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And I have to be honest that, you know, to the Brits maybe

363
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
or someone who doesn't know what college fraternities are like

364
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and initiation, you know, all that screaming may seem

365
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
a little wacky and a little violent and whatever.

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But personally, I went to college for, hmm, see, three and a half months.

367
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was at Salem College in West Virginia.

368
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
My roommate Tyree was from Hamilton, New Jersey.

369
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hamilton was from Newark, New Jersey. His name was Tyree.

370
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Hamilton. The college was about 60% black and since I was from Holland I wasn't white and

371
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I faithfully pledged Kappa which was an interesting initiation, you know, carrying around a brick

372
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,500
and stuff like that. So that doesn't freak me out too much but the whole story is just

373
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
interesting to listen to, particularly when you think about how many US presidents in

374
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:43,500
recent history have been bones men or members of Skull and Bones. And something else that,

375
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,500
well this is a total political statement, not by me by the way, but something I picked

376
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,500
up from MixFreaks.org. Not quite sure who made it, but it's another wonderful montage.

377
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,500
It's kind of an audio version of a Michael Moore. But it's just, it's a, it's a,

378
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,500
it's well done. It's a great mix. It's George Bush and I want you to listen to it. It's

379
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
only two and a half minutes and we still have a whole song of the day to come. But

380
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,500
check out the death of democracy. If you think that your kid is not ready for certain

381
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,500
kinds of environmental simulation, I think it's okay to talk about that.

382
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States

383
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Death of democracy for the American people

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This credits their narrow ideology

385
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Death of democracy for the American people

386
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
We will make this an age of war and misery

387
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Progress must end

388
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I've come here tonight to report to all Americans

389
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
tolerated such an opportunity death of democracy for the American people discredit their narrow

390
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,000
ideology

391
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
of Americans.

392
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,500
their narrow ideology, death of democracy for the American people.

393
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
We will make this an age of war.

394
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Killing is necessary.

395
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,500
necessary. Killing to achieve our goals. Killing is necessary. Chaos to ensure our money is

396
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,500
spent wisely and effectively. Killing to achieve our goals. Killing is necessary. Chaos to

397
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,500
achieve our goals. Chaos is necessary. Killing

398
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
of democracy.

399
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Progress must end.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Death of democracy.

401
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Death of democracy.

402
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Dictatorship is a massive undertaking.

403
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,500
will be respected. Thank you all very much.

404
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Okay, you can get that from a link on mixfreaks.org.

405
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Very nice by the way that the metadata was put into this MP3 or the ID3 tags.

406
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,500
So that means that I can look it up right now as I see encoded by Lane.

407
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
URL link.

408
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Oh here we go.

409
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,500
www.hz37land.com.

410
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,500
So hz37land.com.

411
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:30,500
So I guess that's 37 Hertz is the name of the artist and the composer.

412
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Let's see any comment.

413
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Is there a comment in here?

414
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Produced or range engineered, mixed and edited by hence 37 Hertz Zimmerman.

415
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
See how cool that is.

416
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Okay, let's see the album export more violence.

417
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
God.

418
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Oh man.

419
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Alrighty.

420
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Okay.

421
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Oh I want to do a little techno geek test with you guys.

422
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm going to check my phone system here because now I've got Skype all set up where I should

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
be able to make a phone call directly from my computer and record it.

424
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What I'm going to do here is I'm going to call my wife.

425
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Let's see if she can hear me, if you can hear me, and if we can hear her.

426
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Okay.

427
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Connecting.

428
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
be pretty cool if it works.

429
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Still connecting.

430
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay.

431
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We need, yeah, we need here.

432
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We need a little dialing music on a second.

433
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,500
A little dynamic music for you while we try out the Skype connection here.

434
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We're gonna try it again.

435
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
That's ringing.

436
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Cool.

437
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
I can hear it ringing in the other room.

438
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Hello.

439
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Hello.

440
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Hi, hon.

441
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Hi, babe.

442
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I was just testing my system.

443
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
I know.

444
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
It works.

445
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Crazy person.

446
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Thank you, hon.

447
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
You're such a crazy person.

448
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Yes, all right.

449
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Bye bye.

450
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Love you.

451
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Bye bye.

452
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Bye bye.

453
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Bye bye.

454
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Bye bye.

455
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Bye bye.

456
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Bye bye.

457
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Bye bye.

458
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Bye bye.

459
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Bye bye.

460
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Bye bye.

461
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Okay.

462
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Okay.

463
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
It works.

464
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
So that means that I can call out and talk to people on the phone.

465
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,500
And it means that if I have someone else on Skype call, we can talk to each other for free.

466
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Excellent.

467
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,500
I posted a screenshot of my harvest on my weblog yesterday.

468
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
You remember we talked about that.

469
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm pretty pleased.

470
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
This is the first time I've ever harvested.

471
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,500
I've got...

472
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,500
I should weigh this actually to find out how much it is, but it's now laying out to dry.

473
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm trying to get some advice on that.

474
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I've heard some people say, smoke it now,

475
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
but I don't think it's gonna burn very well.

476
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So everything's on paper towels

477
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to get up some of the moisture,

478
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and then I'm gonna hang them upside down in a dry place

479
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
to see how, yeah, see if we can get that done.

480
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't know how long it's gonna take,

481
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
but I promise once we've harvested,

482
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
once everything's dry,

483
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
we're gonna do a little tasting on the show here.

484
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I failed to point out yesterday, by the way,

485
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
that in many countries in Europe,

486
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
certainly in the Netherlands and in Belgium,

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
you are allowed to have five marijuana plants

488
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
for personal use,

489
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and you're also allowed to have marijuana

490
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
for personal use and to smoke it.

491
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The only problem is you gotta get it from somebody,

492
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and that's, you know, you're allowed to buy it,

493
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
but you're not allowed to sell it.

494
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So it's kind of a funky law we got going on here.

495
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It doesn't matter, I'm not fighting the system,

496
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm happy the way it is.

497
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Shout out to Drew Domkis,

498
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
who listens to the Daily Source Code

499
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
every single day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

500
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And...

501
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Let's see, he says, interesting broadcast from Belgium and Amsterdam.

502
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
My wife and I took a vacation in Amsterdam this past February.

503
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
I enjoyed it very much and plan to return soon.

504
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Good luck with your harvest.

505
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I love the photo you posted of it.

506
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Yes, well, indeed.

507
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
And so this one's going out for you.

508
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
I figured I'm going to play a song of the day today.

509
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I'll play something out that is classical Dutch.

510
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,500
This is a Dutchman who's had minor success in the stakes.

511
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
His name is Herman Berenier.

512
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I'm jumping down the line, and I'm high

513
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,500
I wonder why it's so hard to feel fine

514
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,500
But all I need, is plastic teeth

515
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
And pocket full of speed and I'm full of energy

516
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Never be clever

517
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Never ever

518
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Never be clever

519
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Some say I'm suicidal with the sounds of humor

520
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Some say I'm breaking the past drug rumors

521
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Mom, let's love

522
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Thanks for watching!

523
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I'm so happy to find you

524
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you'll notice

525
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Herman Broth in his wild romance, never be clever and in the states you call him Herman

526
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Brood known from the song Saturday Nights. Probably heard that one. Actually, I can

527
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
let you hear a little bit of that. Sure you've heard Saturday Nights because

528
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that was actually a minor hit in the States.

529
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Wait. Can't even type anymore. Here we go. This is the Saturday night.

530
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Probably heard this one.

531
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Skip ahead.

532
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Okay, shit that's not the version I was looking for.

533
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Anyway, in The Never Be Clever, I just want to tell you, Herman Brod, as we call him here,

534
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,500
or Brood in the States, was truly the rock and roll god in the Netherlands.

535
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,500
When I say was because he passed away, I'll talk about that in a sec.

536
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:41,500
He's done every drug known to man probably every hour of the day that he was awake.

537
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,500
We all found it amazing that he still walked around.

538
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,500
He became an extremely, extremely popular painter for a while.

539
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,500
He had a very highly publicized affair with Nina Hagen.

540
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Imagine those two.

541
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
You've got to look up Herman Brod, so it's Herman, B-R-O-O-D.

542
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,500
I'll look up a picture of him and then this probably pictures of him and Nina Hagen together.

543
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,500
And you heard maybe in the lyrics of Never Be Clever, which was recorded, oh man, it's

544
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
maybe 25 years old.

545
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,500
There's a line there that says some people say I'm suicidal with a sense of humor.

546
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Well indeed, because...

547
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That was about three years ago, a hair man who at the time, he was not doing well.

548
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
He done drugs all his life, heroin being his favorite.

549
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And the doctor said, look, you know, dude, you got to stop the heroin, you got to stop

550
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the drinking or you're going to die.

551
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And what he did was he stopped the heroin, he stopped the drinking and his body freaked

552
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
out.

553
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
His body could not live without the drugs and he was just dying and he was, it

554
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
was, it was bad.

555
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And what he did is he walked about seven or eight minutes from his house in

556
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the south of Amsterdam to the Hilton Hotel, the same one that John and

557
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yoko stayed in bed for a week.

558
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
He walked up to the rooftop and jumped on.

559
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And thus the end of Hair Man Brode.

560
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Thank God we still have his music to play on the source code.

561
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's it for today.

562
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
With little luck in about an hour, an hour and a half or so, I'm going to

563
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
work on taping the new show that we'll do, which I'm sure it won't

564
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
be up anywhere for listening until tomorrow or maybe the weekend.

565
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You know, just let you.

566
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
that we're working on it. And with that I'm going to finish off the source code for today.

567
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Thank you very much for listening. Of course you can always leave a comment at adamantcurry.com.

568
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Bye bye!
