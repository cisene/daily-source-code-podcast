1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Well, hi O.D. everybody and thank god it's Friday!

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Welcome to the source code!

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as the actual name of the place that we inhabited at the time being because we're almost out.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Patricia came back yesterday and she had been on a three-day trip to the UK and she'd been

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
around looking for houses and she put in an offer on one and looks like we're good to go.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And she completely complied with the only requests I had which were A,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
a place that I could stand straight up in. You have no idea how low the houses are

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
outside of London, the country regions. It's just like, man, people were just small

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
back in the day I guess. Anything older than 100 years is going to be really really low

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
when it comes to ceilings. Second request was broadband internet. Well the area that

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
she's found something is in the county of Surrey, Surrey, which has quite a

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
number of high tech centers and we're right near a technology park at a

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
university.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I bet there's plenty of bandwidth there, great infrastructure, great trains, and my third

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,500
and final request was about half an hour away from an airport.

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Well guess what?

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
There's an airport about half an hour away.

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I'm completely jazzed because it has a flight school, which means I can continue my flight

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
training.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Of course I have a helicopter pilot's license.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Now I want fixed wing.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I've only done about 10 or 15 hours of regular airplane training.

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
So I'm going to do a fixed wing.

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
They have a flight school there that does the FAA certification, so that's the American

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,500
license.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
perfect and they have a fly higher fly yourself program so if you're a member of

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,500
the club you can rent a beautiful plane they had they even have a Saratoga which

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
is a great single-engine airplane and nice cruising speed so oh yeah and the

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,500
house is really nice too that really is it's perfect it's absolutely phenomenal

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
and I'm not gonna say too much about it because Patricia was so excited about

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
checking you know out the house and the surroundings in the area that she

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,500
we didn't really pay too much attention to her videography skills and we had

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
last night when she came home we put up the video on the big screen here in the

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,500
living room and I almost got seasick just from you know the motions and she

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,500
did also inadvertently zoomed in a little bit so actually had to do some

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,500
pause and you know step framing back and forth to get a real good idea and

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,500
very hard to get a layout of of a of a house if you haven't been in it and

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,500
someone's just like whips through it with a video camera but we're really

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
excited and I'm sure that we're gonna have a good time there. It looks like

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
somewhere around the middle of November we'll be making our move.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright big shout out going to Skipper today on the source code she is so far

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the one in the

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
request this song on the daily source code. So I'm gonna play it for her. Of course she was also my

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
first employee at OnRamp back in the...

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
to New York City.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been driving all night man's wet on the wheel

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I've been driving all night man's wet on the wheel

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Red Allah

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Videos, things, I've forgotten song

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
RERALAAA

51
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Thanks for watching!

52
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Here I go!

53
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And it's common on the stall

54
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And the newsman sang

55
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I want my rain, I love it!

56
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
GO!

57
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Red our love

58
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh shit, that's what you get for MP3s.

59
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Miss the very ending of it.

60
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Gold nearing radar love on the source code,

61
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
going out by request to Skipper in New York City.

62
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I made a very important discovery yesterday.

63
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I found something, a feature, a hidden feature,

64
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it probably wasn't intentionally hidden,

65
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
but it was hard to find, in Audio Hijack Pro.

66
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I discovered that if you go to the effects portion

67
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
of the application, now this is a program

68
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that you can record audio from any application

69
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
running on your Macintosh.

70
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The effects I thought was really cool

71
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
because you can basically plug in reverbs and echoes

72
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and flangers and compressors and whatever you can think of.

73
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can really process the sound coming from the application

74
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
just perfectly, which is all right.

75
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But what you want to do is, I've

76
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
played about this many, many times,

77
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to be able to mix in a microphone signal.

78
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, darn wouldn't you know it.

79
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Right there under effects is a VST plug-in.

80
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Now I'm not sure if it comes with Audio Hijack Pro or

81
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
it picked it up for my hard drive somewhere. I've certainly never purchased any

82
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
my knowledge. So it's probably a free plugin and it actually says voiceover. Duh! And it

83
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
gives you a nice little effects panel. You can select the audio device. So I've selected

84
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
built-in audio, selected line-in. That's what my mic's connected to. It does little

85
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
crossfade for you. It has an auto ducking threshold if you don't want to click on and

86
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
off switch, which I do like to do because otherwise any cough or sudden noise will

87
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
interrupt the record and actually lower the volume of the record. And you can

88
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
actually set that up so it's mixed in with the signal mixed in as its own source.

89
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So now I have a very stable environment. Well knock on wood and you know there's

90
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
my invitation to Murphy. It appears very stable and I can now get the audio from

91
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
any application I want. In fact I have a couple other bits queued up for later in

92
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the show which are going to come from QuickTime. I can also perfectly bring in

93
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
iChat. I think I've

94
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
got it all running.

95
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm just going to try this setup for a week or so.

96
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I can't wait to do another trade secret with Dave because that's always the real test.

97
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
As it is right now, if someone were to instant message me, I could bring you into the show

98
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
immediately.

99
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I could put you on the air.

100
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Let me just see if I'm actually online at all at this moment.

101
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Very dangerous switching applications where I'm doing this stuff.

102
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah, I'm online.

103
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
People who have me in their buddy list, you know that if I'm online and I'll actually

104
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:15,500
put something in my status bar there, let's see, I'll put in a custom thing there.

105
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Oh, actually, no, I have a custom thing.

106
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Have it on the air.

107
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
There we go.

108
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
On the air.

109
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,500
If I'm on the air and you have something to say, go ahead, just give me an eye chat.

110
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Just check and see.

111
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
The settings are all, oops, settings are all.

112
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Okay, there we go.

113
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,500
That's better.

114
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Perfect.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can close that up.

116
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right, we're all set.

117
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So should anyone call in?

118
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Probably won't because of the first time I'm mentioning it.

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But it's all set up.

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And as I said, it's pretty stable.

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There's a few quirks to it.

122
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But once I've tried it out for about a week, then I'm going to write it up so that people

123
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
can start to emulate the same setup because now I don't even have a breakout box working.

124
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Granted, I can't route the audio yet back to the person on the other end of the call.

125
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And Skype still, I was able to get it working a little bit, but Skype is just not really

126
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
happy with what I'm doing.

127
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And until they support multiple sound devices, I guess we just can't use it.

128
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So we'll have to wait until they...

129
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, it's still in beta.

130
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was a long way to go.

131
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll see if there's a Skype mailing list and see if I can get some feature requests

132
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
in there.

133
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Another question I had, and I've got a lot of feedback on the past shows and I really

134
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
appreciate it, is file size.

135
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Now looking at the bandwidth, I'm pushing out at this point at the top of the hour when

136
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
there's a new source code or new trade secrets.

137
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,500
upwards of 12 megabits per second of traffic.

138
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
This is an enormous amount.

139
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
And so eventually, that's going to cause problems.

140
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
And so we know that we're working on bit torrent integration,

141
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
and I don't want to talk too much about that today.

142
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
But one of the things that certainly can be done

143
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
is to lower the file size.

144
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
So I've been on a quest.

145
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I don't understand too much about it

146
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,500
about continuous bit rate, variable bit rate.

147
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah, I do understand what it is

148
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
and how it's supposed to work.

149
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
But in practice, what is the right setting?

150
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
What is the perfect setting for voice and music

151
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
and for the slowest file size possible?

152
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Well, wouldn't you know it?

153
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
We got an audio message from Dr. Dave,

154
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
who was more than happy to explain the right way to do it.

155
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
And Dr. Dave, it's good to have him online,

156
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
because, well, you'll hear immediately,

157
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
this is a guy that you want to have some kind of podcast

158
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
from on a daily basis.

159
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Check him out.

160
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Hello, I'm Dr. Dave from Las Vegas,

161
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
former disc jockey in the Las Vegas, Phoenix,

162
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
in San Diego markets.

163
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
But that goes way back to this.

164
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't even know if you're that old.

165
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Bumper Morgan is a friend of mine,

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and he was kind enough to send me a link to your site,

167
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
where you archive your mp3 files.

168
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Listening to the one dated today, 9...

169
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
before you were talking about file size.

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, may I suggest a few things?

171
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
First, use a lower bit rate.

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
32 KBS will still give you up to 16 kilohertz

173
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
in audio quality, far superior to FM radio,

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and really better than most systems

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and headphones out there can reproduce.

176
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So by doing that, or if you go down to 22 KBS,

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you're still at 11 kilohertz, about equal to FM radio,

178
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and essentially cutting your file size in half.

179
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Two other ways to decrease your file size

180
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
are stretch, which actually compresses

181
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,500
maintaining frequency and pitch and delete silence, which allows for all of the intelligible

182
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
information to be saved and eliminates the silent portions.

183
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
It's an effect that's built into...

184
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
For further information drop me a voicemail or email awchetcocks.net.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Again from Las Vegas it's Dr. Dave. Clear.

186
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, clear. Perfect. I'd fly with Dr. Dave any day. I'd love to hear about the radio.

187
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay, so I'm going to take his advice and see if I can lower it down to 32 to get to half the file size if not all re-encode.

188
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But, wouldn't it be great to have Dr. Dave, I gotta have Dr. Dave cut some liners, some

189
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
jingles for the show, you know, this is perfect for the daily source code, outstanding.

190
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So, I'm gonna work on that.

191
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I do wanna, I'm almost ready to make an endorsement.

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And I'm talking about iPodder.

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
iPodder, this is the first time you're hearing the show, is a small program that basically

194
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
fills up your iPod with anything you subscribe to, with shows, information, audio books,

195
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
well, we're still working on the audio books part, but it is just beginning.

196
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now, I'm using a Mac, but there are currently versions for Mac, Windows,

197
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Linux, and Pocket PC.

198
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I know there's also a Java version being worked on.

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So there's plenty of opportunity for everyone to play with this.

200
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It doesn't also only work with iPod, it works with Windows and

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
other, with a Windows Media Player and anything that you can sync up to

202
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Windows Media Player, it manages stuff from your playlist.

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's great.

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So, go to iPodder.org, check it out.

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Now, I feel that it's about.

206
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,500
time to make an endorsement for a product because what I want to get away from is, you know,

207
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
all these versions floating out there.

208
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Now already I've seen everything kind of come together and I'm still a bit confused and I'm

209
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
not trying to intervene too much.

210
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm not quite sure who's working with who and where.

211
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
But I think that pretty soon we should be able to say here's iPod for Mac, here's

212
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,500
iPod for Windows and here's iPod for Linux and if we have it here's iPod for, for

213
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,500
a pocket PC but just one version, not multiple versions and already some of the

214
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,500
scripts have been discontinued and work is, you know, as I said is being focused on

215
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
certain apps.

216
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
I want to point out iPod or X.

217
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,500
This is what I've been using for the past couple of days and iPod or X is based on

218
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I believe the iSpider engine.

219
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
It doesn't matter because it's all Python under the hood and the iPod or X part

220
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
is really just the interface.

221
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I've also seen some screenshots of a Windows interface which emulates what iPod

222
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm really really happy about iPodRx because it has no install.

223
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's an application. You drop it in your applications folder, you double click it, it opens, it runs.

224
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It immediately shows you your feeds, you can add there, you can delete from there, you can check there,

225
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
you can stop the check if you want to, you can make it run automatically, you can put a little slider,

226
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
control when it's going to run. And these guys understand now what users are looking for.

227
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
When you say that it runs automatically, it tells you right there.

228
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When you run this automatically, even when you quit the application, it's still going to continue to run

229
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and fill up your iPod. Turning it off will obviously turn it off.

230
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And they also understand the marketing. If you look at iPodR.sourceforge.net,

231
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
that's what you say, wait a minute, am I saying that correctly?

232
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm afraid to surf. Damn.

233
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'll post a link to iPodRx. See, this is how confusing it is.

234
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Look at that website.

235
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,500
One simple page with beautiful graphics, with very simple language tells you exactly what

236
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
it does, exactly what it is, and it's just inviting.

237
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You just want to go and do it.

238
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
You want to get this and get your hands on it.

239
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,500
So I'm leaning towards an endorsement there for the Mac version of the iPodder, and I'd

240
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
like to look at candidates for Windows.

241
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
I have a Windows machine here, a Windows 2000 machine.

242
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I can run something there.

243
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
And I'd like to get this out sometime next week, because we need to move on.

244
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,500
We've got to get going, particularly on the publishing side as it comes to BitTorrent,

245
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
so that we can start saving ourselves some bandwidth.

246
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I pointed to something else on my weblog today, live.curry.com, a keynote speech held for

247
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
the music industry by Andrew Olofsky.

248
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,500
And I urge you to read that, because he said something there that is so beautiful.

249
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
He says that in about five years...

250
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There will be an iPod that will fill itself up automatically.

251
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Apple probably won't make that iPod, someone else will.

252
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And I went, yes. Not five years from now, my friend.

253
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's already been done. And we're all a group of very dedicated people.

254
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And you should read his vision on that because he says, in essence, he says,

255
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
music industry now is the time to pounce.

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There is no bigger opportunity to make money off of the music business by selling

257
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
music and packaging in new and interesting ways than right now.

258
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now the flawed, I think, his speech, not that it's a flawed idea,

259
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
is he says, look, for all the crap you're going to go through,

260
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
in addition to what you've gone through already, by switching to digital and download and peer to

261
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And he has some very, very clear ideas on how to make money, regardless of whether peer-to-peer

262
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
sharing and just, you know, exchange of music is going on or not.

263
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
His bridge finance, if you will, is a taxation.

264
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And oh, my daughter just instant messaged me, don't forget to videotape top of the pub's

265
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
BBC one 830p.

266
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You got it, dear.

267
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I have the...

268
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Good Charlotte.

269
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Good Charlotte's going to be on.

270
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Can you close the door for me, hon?

271
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you.

272
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Bye.

273
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Bye.

274
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, he says taxation is the way to go.

275
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And of course it would cost next to nothing, but to get that to happen were probably, well,

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
if the music business, you know, took that idea, they could probably lobby that reasonably

277
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
effectively, but I doubt that they'll go for that.

278
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But that did give me a whole bunch of ideas, man.

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Just a whole bunch of ideas running around in my head.

280
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And I came across a couple of sound clips that I want to play for you.

281
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Sound pertains to the music business, although it's aimed at George Bush, of course.

282
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,500
stuff that I just pick up on the net from the blog digger media feed and other places.

283
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,500
And I really want to try and start fill the source code up a little bit more with stuff

284
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
that's out there.

285
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,500
And hey, if you've got a cool song or just anything, send me a pointer.

286
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I love to play stuff and particularly stuff that you won't hear on commercial radio.

287
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
And I think we ought to use this medium as optimally as possible in anticipation

288
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
of the record business catching on.

289
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Right, we got a couple of years.

290
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
So here's something I picked up off blog digger feed.

291
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
This is called scum of the earth.

292
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Scum of the earth.

293
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
George W. Bush.

294
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
The fat fuck.

295
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Russ Zimbab.

296
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
George Liddy.

297
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Pint.

298
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
And pensioners of the state.

299
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
We ought to be heard.

300
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
George W. Bush.

301
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Russ.

302
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Pint.

303
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Terrorism.

304
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Russ.

305
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Scum of the earth.

306
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
George W. Bush.

307
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
The fat fuck.

308
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Terrible.

309
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Russ Zimbab.

310
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
George Liddy.

311
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Pint.

312
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
And pensioners of the state.

313
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
We ought to be heard.

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Spoon!

315
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Tip tip terrace in the

316
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Rock

317
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Gumbelord

318
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah

319
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
George W. Bush

320
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The Fast Pop

321
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Tip tip terrace in the

322
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Gumbelord

323
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Last symbol.

324
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Go on, little pimp.

325
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,500
And pimpness of the state, we ought to be...

326
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Ruff.

327
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
George W. Bush.

328
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Scum of the Earth.

329
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Well, I'm not quite sure what the message is there, unless you take it at completely

330
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
at face value.

331
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Scum of the Earth from the blog digger media feed.

332
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,500
And I should probably say that source code is NSFW and it's always going to be that

333
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
way.

334
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,500
You may not get your, you know, the porn you're looking for on each listen of a show,

335
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,500
but you can certainly expect some raunchy stuff to be played once in a while.

336
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
And I love mashups and mixes.

337
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
In fact, well, maybe I'll do one tomorrow, you never know.

338
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,500
But certainly for Monday's source code, I'll scrunch up a couple of mashups.

339
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
That's where you take an old song, a new song, mix them together.

340
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
It's cool.

341
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
It's kind of a retro techno thing.

342
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
But you'll probably dig it.

343
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
If not, let me know.

344
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Adam at Curry.com.

345
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
This is also your show.

346
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
And this, of course, is where users and developers party together.

347
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Gonna take a look in the mailbag.

348
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Hold on.

349
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500
I got some mailbag music for us here.

350
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oops, there we go.

351
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Let's see.

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Switching to male, so that can always mess up the sound.

353
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What you did there?

354
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Okay.

355
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Got male from...let me see.

356
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This is from Andrew Jaffe.

357
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He actually sent this to Dave Weiner and myself regarding the Daily Source Code.

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And he listens to our shows while he's riding the tube in London.

359
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He also says he's looking forward to my arrival.

360
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
said something pretty astute. He said, you know, I really love listening to all these

361
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
podcasts, but when are people going to stop talking about the podcasting themselves and

362
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
actually do some podcasting? And this isn't working too well with my quick time window.

363
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's definitely not liking this. Okay, let me just turn that off. Again, a little low

364
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
on processing speed here. So I totally agree. Andrew, you know, the days of

365
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
testing, testing one, two, three, four, you know, that's almost over. We're getting our

366
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
At least 600, 700 people subscribed to the daily source code.

367
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
That's a lot of people.

368
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Put them all in one room and you'll see.

369
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,500
And he also has a feature request for the iPod, which I asked him to send off to the iPod

370
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
development list.

371
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
And I don't know if Andrew is...

372
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Let me see.

373
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
He's in the Astrophysics Group.

374
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Are you a user or developer in the Astrophysics Group at Imperial College?

375
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
His request is for some file management.

376
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I knew that was going to come.

377
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,500
And I think that's something that can be done in the ongoing development of iPodr,

378
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,500
is how your cache is cleaned up, when files are deleted, et cetera.

379
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
It's a pretty normal stuff.

380
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
And I think that's a great user request.

381
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Let's see.

382
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Oh, Dave and I were talking on the...

383
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,500
On Trade Secrets about Netflix, about the RSS feeds for your queue on Netflix,

384
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
and how he wants to aggregate those together.

385
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
If you haven't heard his explanation of what he wants to do,

386
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,500
I suggest you listen to Trade Secrets volume number...

387
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So, Miles Weisslater from meetup.com sent me a link and said that the UK version of Netflix

388
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
is videoisland.com.

389
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So even though it's not available in Belgium and not in the Netherlands when I get to

390
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
the UK, I can also get a Netflix-like subscription.

391
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't know if they have RSS feeds though, hopefully by the time I get there.

392
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And Pete Pradol, Raster Web Audio, sent me a little note, a blurb about ESPN.

393
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I guess this is taken from their homepage.

394
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm just going to read this quote.

395
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
With our last redesign in 2003, ESPN.com

396
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
motion. By downloading high quality video transparently to users hard drives we were able to give our

397
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
viewers free of charge some of the highest quality video on the web with no waiting no buffering

398
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and no noticeable encoding artifacts. The simple installation of the little ESPN ActiveX control

399
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
users could watch freshly cut ESPN video right within our front page. So sounds like these

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
guys have the right idea you know the thought of bringing in video or bringing in any type of

401
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
content using that word overnight when you're basically on downtime you know and it doesn't

402
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
have to be overnight with today's bandwidth speed you've got a real fast pipe you can set it for a

403
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
couple times a day just like iPodder but you know I doubt that they're using RSS and that's really

404
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
a shame you know think about the audience they could have how they could increase their audience

405
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
just you know with with one day's worth of development and a little bit of thought and

406
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
just the right blink here and there I mean people would go

407
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,500
freaking nuts. And they'd pay for that, I'm sure they would. The infrastructure is already

408
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,500
there. There are so many news readers out there that already support enclosures and people

409
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,500
are working on more every single day. It's a shame. It's absolutely a shame.

410
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:53,500
And I wanted to talk about Mars Edit. This is a brand new application for Mac OS X and

411
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:00,500
it's a blogging app. And it can, it basically is a front end for different blogging systems.

412
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,500
And it supports a whole slew of them. You know, every single one that I know and

413
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,500
actually, and then some, including Radio User Land, which is what I use. And so

414
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,500
basically it knows the API of the weblog system you use. And it also works for

415
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Manila sites and for movable type and for blogger. It's beautiful. But it has so

416
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
much built in. It is so well thought out. And I think that's probably very much

417
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,500
because it's a, it comes from a Mac, a Mac developers thinking. It's so user

418
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
friendly and I've started using it now and it's still, it's in beta.

419
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
now. But it's just kick-ass. It really does the job well. It does it fast. It's real simple

420
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
because I do a lot of, I have to go back and edit a lot of my posts mainly for spelling

421
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
errors that I don't, I check posts, the posts. I don't know why, but I do and people will

422
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
point out huge glaring errors. And also it's easier than going to my web log and looking

423
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
down the page. I can just look at the last 50 postings that I did and pull out information

424
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that I might want to talk about. It's very whizzy-wig although you basically, the way I

425
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
use it is you know I write up the post and then I'll add the links and it does

426
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
show those to you in HTML code, but at the same time you can have a preview window

427
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
open and it types along with you so you can see whizzy-wig exactly what it's

428
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
going to look like. So that's, that's pretty good. And it also, and the

429
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
whizzy-wig is really a browser so if you add a picture which it also has a

430
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
little special window pane for to help you upload pictures to your server, it's

431
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,500
It's fantastic. It's really what I've been looking for.

432
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I've been using an outliner to do my posts.

433
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,500
I really like using an outliner for writing, but for the

434
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,500
length of the post that I make, you know, if I really have to write something

435
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,500
that's going to be a couple paragraphs or that, you know, lots of thought needs to go into,

436
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,500
then I'll write in an outliner first and then I'll just copy-paste it into

437
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
into Mars Edit. And don't even have to do that because Mars Edit

438
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,500
is fully scriptable. So I could pass it off from an outline window

439
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,500
from Radio Userland right into that, into the

440
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:17,500
into the Mars Edit, you know, the new posting creation window.

441
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,500
I was going to say something else about it. Oh, yeah, it has built in Apple

442
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Scripts. One that I've been, I just started using, which oh man,

443
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,500
it's like diarrhea of the blog. It's a post from Safari. So basically you just

444
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,500
copy a little bit of text on a web page in Safari. You run the script from the

445
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,500
from the Mars Edit menu.

446
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and it posts in a post for you, which is also configurable.

447
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It'll take the title of the page, you know, what's in the menu bar.

448
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It'll do a colon and then a quotation mark.

449
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So it's really, it's removing four steps that I used to do manually in the Outliner.

450
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I should look at the script actually, but it's really cool.

451
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You can set the parameters, how you want the default post to show up when you post from Safari.

452
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So just totally tits as we say in New Jersey.

453
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And only one request, of course, is enclosure support.

454
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You know, and I would fully expect to be able to just drag and drop something on there,

455
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
but I'll take a URL that'll be great for me.

456
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And you know, once that's in there, it's, wow, it's great.

457
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I can't wait until the final candidate is released.

458
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm a customer for sure.

459
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay, what are we doing here?

460
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
32 minutes. Time to wrap up.

461
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Ooh, did I get rid of that I had?

462
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh shoot, I was going to play like pull it up from iTunes for you now.

463
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,500
It's gonna play another song that I found on the blog digger media feed.

464
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm gonna play that as the fight. It's just a little it's just a little ditty. It's from Uncle Neptune. Yeah, here we go

465
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I've got it in it. Oops

466
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,500
be careful when I switch from one application to the next.

467
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500
It's just a nice little ditty that I think will cheer you up for a Friday.

468
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I hear Robbins...

469
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Or if I never feel blue

470
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Remember that there's always something that you can do

471
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,500
When you see the good in everything

472
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
I see sunshine

473
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Or if I'm ever feeling blue

474
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Remember that there's always something that you can do

475
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Where you see the good in everything

476
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
When the day is dark and bright and-

477
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Let us see the gift in every day

478
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I feel sweet love in a sad world

479
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
is really grand

480
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
For if I'm ever feeling blue

481
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Remember that's always something that you can do

482
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,500
When you see the cut in everything

483
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Uncle Neptune when you see the good in everything and that's it for the sor-

September 24th, 2004.
