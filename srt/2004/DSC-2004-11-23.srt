1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I guess it's a very curry.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And hello everybody!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Once again coming to you from Curry Cottage in the UK,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
this is your daily source code.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is Tuesday, November 23, 2004.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Long night!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How y'all doing?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, that was our story.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, it's our first day!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Friends, I am not well today.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I see it.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Not well.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Not well.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's…

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I guess it's typical that I get sick right after,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you know, all the heavy bits start to fall into place such as

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the movie.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But we finally got all the stuff fed away with our animals,

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I woke up this morning at 5 o'clock,

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I was mass.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And it literally have…

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Like some kind of one thing, like almost like pneumonia, I think it is.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You know, pneumonia kind of feels like a truck hit your back.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's what I got.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I've been just from that bike ride that I took on Saturday down to Starbucks.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And remember when I was kind of an hour,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fudging around trying to find my way back, that's probably when that all happened.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I've been pretty much immobilized for most of the day.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's my bag.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's my shoulders.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's my chest.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's my stomach.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's completely messed up.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Not that you want any details on that.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I kind of hung around a little bit today.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was up really early this morning.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Notice that my upload of the daily source code had not worked the way I intended it to.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm still on the narrow band line, by the way, on the phone line, which is actually.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm still amazed at how fast and how optimized the web is.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For instance, for, you know, these, when am I getting like 40, 44k per second speed here.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know, it's, I'm amazed at that.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It really am amazed at that speed.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And it takes, was it to upload 21 megs.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It takes about an hour and 40 minutes, now and 45, maybe a little bit, two hours.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So it's not all that bad, really.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But of course, that's not true because in the other hand,

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
life is just, it comes to a crawling halt if you don't have the speed.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I mean, email alone.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You spend so much more time dealing with, you're information when you're on a slow,

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
low link that it's, yeah, it's really, it sucks.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And still the provisional line status.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So we're looking at next week, Tuesday at the earliest that I'll be able to get my broad

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
band in here, which means, of course, tomorrow, come hell or high water.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to make a, uh, a stop at the Starbucks.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I got a, a weeklong pass for the team mobile hotspot.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Uh, it's like 30 pounds.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, yeah, it was, it was better than, if I able to go there two days and just get two hours

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
worth each time, then it would be the same amount or more.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Um, and I'm Jones and man, I'm so Jones and for podcasts, because that's the one thing that

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
just does not work on the dial-up line.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No way.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it's, yeah, it sucks.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really, really, really sucks.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then you add to that, they're not feeling well.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Anyway, so what do we do today?

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Um, oh, we, uh, we opened up a bank account.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or at least we started.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you can't do anything here, as, you know, as probably is the same almost everywhere.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Um, unless you, uh, unless you have some kind of credit history, you have something built up,

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
uh, something you can point to that says, yeah, you know, I'm, I'm a, I'm a guy that you

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
want to, uh, rent a cell phone to give a cell phone contract, you know, stuff like that.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's just a minor stuff.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So we're really, you know, uh, enjoying the pioneering of it.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Um, it's, uh, uh, you know, just figuring out new stuff, um, the whole new culture, a whole new country.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's exactly what we wanted.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is exactly what we wanted.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Um, and you know what?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's fucking tired, exactly what we expected.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's tiring to go through this right now.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it's going to be great.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And we're, uh, we're really enjoying ourselves.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And we're just enjoying the culture, totally.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Um, part of that culture, of course, is driving on the left hand side of the road.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now I have a, uh, left hand drive.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I'm sitting on the left hand side of the car.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's an Audi, uh, that I've, you know, that I had in, uh, in Holland and in Belgium.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And there's another year left on the lease.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So I figured just, you know, drive around in it here until it's, uh,

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
into like, and bring it back.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Um, thank goodness.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It has a great GPS system built into it.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I mean, really, uh, detail DVD.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So it, you know, if you fuck up and you, uh, or as we say, if you cock up and you, uh,

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
uh, and you miss your turn, which is very, uh, possible.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I hold on, uh, what did my software update just said?

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You should update airport software, bluetooth module, firmware, iCal.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
iPod update or uh-oh, what's in the iPod update or?

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's see, compatibility with iTunes 4.7, iTunes music store,

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
shuffle and play song library with one click.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The hell does that mean?

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Create multiple on the go play lists.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
To lead songs from the on the go play list.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Select reading playback speed for audiobooks.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, check that out.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I wonder if it's fast and slow.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Here, click wheel, clicker through the headphones.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Ooh, I love that, baby.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sync and go with improved disconnect performance.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sync and go.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Now with improved disconnect iTunes.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, wait.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Here we go.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
iPod update or 2004.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, Sync and go with improved disconnect performance.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You need it.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't think so.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Not for 20 megs.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I kind of do that on my phone line.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Boeys.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Morning.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Um, so back to driving left.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Baron, uh, has a theory about why they drive on the left hand side of the road in the UK.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Um, he says during revolutionary war, the colonists move their channel markers,

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
markers from marking the entrances to harbors, ports.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So that it was safe to stay on the right side of the marker, the British and previously

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the colonists, the colonists, rode their boats on the left side of the marker to stay safe.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thus, when the British tried to attack by ships coming through the channel, they grounded

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
their boats by going left.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So chock it up to a sneaky Americans.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, that's an interesting theory there, actually.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, I still like the one where, you know, if you're riding along and there's a rival

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that might come up on horseback that, you know, you want to be able to chop his head off

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
or at least jost him off his horse and you do that with your right hand.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So it's easier to be driving left or riding left.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Um, Martin, uh, from green dragon online.co.uk has a different take quite simple while we're driving

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the left.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
All our cars are right hand drive.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If we drove on the right, we wouldn't be able to see the traffic lights and directional signpost.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, hold on.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I had an audio comment about left hand driving.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me just open that up from, uh, the podcast show notes.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I have no idea who this was from.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's check it out.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
On another note, I was listening to, uh, Adam Curry's daily source code.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And he, of course, he's in the UK now.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And he was talking about getting used to driving on the left hand side of the road.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I just have to relate a story.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A number of years ago, I was living in Guam.

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And, uh, traveling a lot to Japan.

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And, uh, Guam, they drive on the right hand side of the road, of course, in Japan.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They've been driving on the left hand side, which everybody says is the right way to drive.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But, you know, I, I mean, American, I, I much prefer to drive on the right hand side.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And you can always tell when you're in Japan.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And there's a new, uh, a new driver because they are, they are the ones that, uh,

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
they pull up to a light.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And, uh, instead of their, uh, uh, uh, uh, turn a single coming on.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They're windshield wifers start, uh, spiking back and forth.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then when it's not even raining.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I mean, that's a good indication that you've got a newly driver across from you.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Or even next to you.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I've been guilty of it a few times.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But I've been traveling back and forth a lot.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And actually, it's been like two months in Japan.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And, uh, so my car had been parked at the, uh,

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
a long-term parking in Guam.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I arrived back and I got to, got the car started just fine.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And everything was good and it was dark.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I get out on the road and, you know, I got my lights on.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I'm looking down the street.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And there's this guy coming down the street on the wrong side of the street.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't think of myself.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who is this knucklehead?

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is on the wrong side of the street.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I start flashing my lights at the guy.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And, and I'm finally, I'm trying to think, what in the world?

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You know, we're going to have a collision here.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it dawned on me.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey, dumbass.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're the one that's on the wrong side of the road.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a boy on the road.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I had become so accustomed to driving on the left hand side of the road.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because when I pulled all that parking lot,

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I immediately got in the left hand lane and started trucking down the street

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
without even, you know, subconsciously thinking that, you know,

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
this guy that's coming at me, you know, it wasn't me.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It was him, you know.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It was, it was pretty funny.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So if Adam, if you're listening to the show,

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
when I may send you this clip,

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
don't be surprised if you make a few mistakes.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So when they're getting used to driving on the left hand side of the street.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, yeah.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, yeah, baby.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Actually, that's what I really like about the Audi.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's the 4.2 liter show.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The roundabout to the scariest thing.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know, you get into the roundabout.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And you're going to left hand side.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And you just, you know,

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
that's, you want to have a car that can accelerate quick at that moment.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know, so you just like,

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think it's great.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Go.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I did that in New York once.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I drove everyone home.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I was like, three in the morning,

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but working on a pitch at think new ideas.

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I can't remember what Avenue it is.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I turned right on.

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But I turned right onto something that was totally not possible

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
because they were, they were most of an eight cars all coming at us.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They're like, just changed as well.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I turned up the wrong way out of one way.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Straight at his quite a frightening, frightening thing to see.

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey, email from yourtmentink.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I guess he's Dutch.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yourtmentink.com.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, that doesn't say anything about his background.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But he sent me a clip.

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He says that Amy Poolor performed a nice little boing.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
On last Saturdays, Saturday Night Live.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Check it out.

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Pfizer has agreed to pull its wild thing.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Viagra television ads Monday.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
After the FDA complained that they made the impenence drug

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
sound like a recreational sex aid.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And not the preferred form of grandma abuse that it is.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They've also decided...

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Pfizer has also decided to drop the idea of changing the name of the drug

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
to boing.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That was a good one.

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The drug to boing.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She really got it down.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Didn't she?

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, man.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know, you know.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We're going to get that.

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We're going to be changing the name of the drug to boing.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Excellent.

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, time for some tunes on your daily source code.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is a mashup.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Something that you'll never see a fisher released.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's done by a...

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
A...

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It was to say a quote, band called Bittalica.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The bassley mashup, the Beatles, and the tower.

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You'll get it.

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You'll dig it.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It...

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It...

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You...

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's true not...

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
See...

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I...

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Take a grassaw

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And make it better.

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Remember...

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The melody is in your heart

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And you can start to be your friend.

262
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And you...

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't be fucking bread.

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now...

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You will meet too.

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You'll be a charader.

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So many eyes.

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You'll let us on your sky.

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Then you'll be gay.

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
To be a predator.

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So crank around.

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000

340
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,040
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know

341
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,040
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

342
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
I know to read the ones inside of things

343
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,640
Better than you do, I know, I know

344
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:38,040
I see no more hate

345
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,240
All right, just...just-how cool is that?

346
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:07,480
Vitalik is hey dude on the daily source code for Tuesday November 23rd, 2004 coming to you from the UK from the region of Seren

347
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,560
Man, I gotta stop doing it again. I gotta stop doing it

348
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,600
But what's cool about people not knowing me here, which is just cool by itself, you know being

349
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,360
Coming from celebrity status to zero is fucking awesome

350
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,680
You know you can have so much fun with people and you know there's they have no preconceived notions about you or you know

351
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,200
Who you are what you are or what you what you're about and so the set first impression. I like playing with that

352
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,480
It's it's cool

353
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,800
I have a lot of fun over here in

354
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,080
You know new digs

355
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,440
I've been right played the lascivious bitties yesterday for you. This is

356
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,640
The band from New York this girls have a very very very typical sound and we've been in touch for a couple of years

357
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,600
I can't remember when the first time I heard about them

358
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,160
Shoot I Patricia even remembered

359
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,360
But we've we've been in touch over the years and Leanne

360
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,960
Aliana Westover. It says she was really happy actually

361
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,240
Overjoyed that she was playing on the daily source code

362
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,920
Particularly because they're they're going through a rough time right now

363
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,680
They were on a trip to Boston. I guess they're playing some gigs over the weekend

364
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,160
So I'm broken to the room. They were sleeping in stole diggers keyboard and a keyboard amp a man does new Brian more guitar and

365
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Unfortunately Leanne's not backed up lately laptop

366
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,240
That does totally freaking bite I hate that

367
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,160
But she goes on to say that and of course all these emails are in the in the show notes

368
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,960
She says I'm renting out a room for the holidays or someone who who says that you wrote the email tour

369
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,280
Not only your cool because you gave us a great deal on the room, but not even cooler because you were played on the daily source code

370
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,280
And you know my my radio mentor Lex Harding

371
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,080
Who was a one of the original

372
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,200
Broadcasters on the pirate radio stations on the North Sea back in the very early 70s even the late 60s

373
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,240
I think

374
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,760
Went on to found the public broadcast of Veronica television. He's done a lot of a lot of radio stuff

375
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,400
But he even sent me an SMS the other day and said wow, you know like I got some guy

376
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,680
I know from Singapore who listens to your podcast every day. It's just cool. It's really getting around and um, and oh, yeah, there was a

377
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,800
I just posted that on an I potted out org

378
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,400
There was a an article in the London Times

379
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,600
podcast in the next the next the next big thing so

380
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,680
Just moving

381
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Anyway, back to the city as bitties and we'll get back to the UK in a second in the BBC

382
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,960
I feel really bad about you know when your shit gets stolen that is just so that really really really sucks

383
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,480
Yes, that I played I want to be famous which is one of my favorite tracks off their new album

384
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,120
This is something though even though it's totally not the kind of music this tracking when it played with it by the city as bitties

385
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
It's not

386
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,120
It's not really the type of music that I'm into but there's something about it that just you know

387
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,360
I can't help but sing along with the song. It's very a country in western, but then again you don't hear enough of that on radio

388
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,480
Anyway, do you use Texas girl the busbiest bitties on the daily source code

389
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
Oh

390
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,920
Son in the blue Texas guy. You can take the girl

391
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,120
Like a flower you can look from the world

392
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,280
But no matter where she roam she is never by my home because you can take Texas out of the girl

393
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,880
I am thankful for the things that the Lord has given

394
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,920
I am proud of the things for myself

395
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:11,080
I have earned but I still miss the big old fields of cotton and I long for the song of my

396
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:19,800
Buckingbird you can take the girl out of Texas like an apple you can look from the world

397
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:28,120
No matter where she roam she is never by my home because you can take Texas out of the girl

398
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:49,000
I have earned but I still miss the big old fields of cotton

399
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,960
I have earned but I still miss the big old fields of cotton

400
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:12,200
Texas like a flower you can look from the world

401
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,800
But no matter where she roam she is never by home because you can take Texas out of this girl

402
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:28,040
Oh you can take the girl out of Texas like an apple you can look from the world

403
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,280
But no matter where she roam she is never by my home because you can take Texas out of the

404
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:44,520
Take Texas out of the girl everybody now you have Texas girl

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,560
The Civius Bitties on your daily source code

406
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,920
Okay, let me see you want to talk about oh of course I want to plug the the BBC culture show

407
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:00,040
Since it's coming up on Thursday and you know the way iPodders work and the way it works with me uploading and time differences

408
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,280
Everything like that it'll be online they do have an archive that's up for cut the

409
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:14,040
BPS do is BBC is doing some interesting things these days and they aren't they do seem to be keeping archives up for a couple of days of of most of their or a lot of their stuff

410
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,640
So it's on Thursday BBC to the culture show

411
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,080
7 p.m. I got a lovely email from Colin the producer

412
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:31,160
I don't came in if I told you about that yesterday, but he says they cut it down from nine minutes to six minutes or not he but the powers that be

413
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,520
And what he said that he was he really was really happy with it. So we'll see what happens now

414
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,480
I was just reading in the Guardian and by a man

415
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,880
Compared to Holland and Belgium the UK what a what a newspaper country. There's so many different newspapers

416
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,000
And the Guardian of course I know from online and

417
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,380
And I picked up the copy the Guardian and the BBC is in the midst of a huge huge huge

418
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,380
shake up

419
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,440
There's I think the number was 27,000 people work for the beat 27,000 people work for the BBC

420
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Now they do have a lot of a lot of stations and you know TV and radio and in an incarnate and all the stuff that they have to you know have to manage and fill up and

421
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,320
You have to pay for a TV license which I still have to arrange before they serve me a warrant

422
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,920
Which said was it made a hundred pounds or something like that so yeah, it's probably it's probably a good

423
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,600
Close to two hundred dollars. I would say probably

424
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,080
So you know you do kind of feel like you know, you're you want to get what you pay for and

425
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,040
Man 27,000 people is a lot to run you know some TV and radio stations

426
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,320
And they're talking about letting independent producers in to produce more of

427
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Of this public broadcast

428
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:59,240
Programming which is commercial free obviously very high quality. I love it. I love the BBC programming. I really do

429
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,560
And sure there's the ITV stuff and you know channel four channel five

430
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,360
Which has the I'm a celebrity get me out of here and you know so the millionaire

431
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:16,760
We want to be a millionaire and those are good too. You need some chewing gum, but man the BBC there's some awesome awesome programs on the radio as well just fabulous stuff

432
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,560
And so my own experience as as

433
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,440
The United Kingdom is going through this and they're trying to figure out you know what should we do and

434
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,360
What's the what are the right moves to make clearly clearly? They have too many people working for them that is just that's an outrage

435
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,440
But I'm a little wary about letting all these commercial independent producers in because they did that in Holland and it really sucks

436
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,240
You know because these guys are about making money not about making necessarily not about making great television

437
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,280
And of course the country is smaller so maybe it's harder to make a buck in in the lowlands, but

438
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,480
You know a lower level of independent producers. I think it's good

439
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,960
Not not too much because you really that's my experience. You're going to lose lose a lot of the good creativity

440
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,840
But certainly the bureaucracy that is

441
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,480
You know that makes up that amount of people working on you know on that much there's only 24 hours in a day, right?

442
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,080
That's that's pretty amazing. So I'm following this

443
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,040
It was really was a big article like six or seven pages and

444
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,360
You know there's there's a lot of stake. They're also they've moved or in the throws of moving a lot of people out of London into

445
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
I think it was

446
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Was it I don't have it here

447
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Manchester Birmingham

448
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,320
I'll have to look into that but so clearly a lot of BBC history and a lot of changes going on as we speak and there as I mentioned before

449
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,320
There's so much media going on here. You know we have the the free view which plugs

450
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,680
Digital signals out of thin air and gives you like 30 channels for free and you can order stuff

451
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,840
And it's just you buy a box once and that's it. No cable company nothing. It's just coming right out of the air

452
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,920
I'm gonna get the sky box as well, which is pretty much a dish

453
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,600
I want that in Christina's hangout room

454
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,040
Yeah, so you know I'll be able to fill you in on on that experience

455
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
um

456
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,600
And then what else do they have and they've cable? I think we might even have cable here. I'm just gonna try and get everything

457
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
But keeping a sharp eye on what's happening here

458
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,240
With the with broadcasting in general BBC in particular and I'm really excited about

459
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,920
a new piece of knowledge that I gained Dave wine and wrote how to

460
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
um

461
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,800
I want to say it right it was a how to extend RSS in namespaces

462
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,880
And this is something that I've been you know

463
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,440
Not only I but I see it on the iPod or developers list. We've been you know thinking about how can we group different kinds of

464
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,120
Inclosures or files or you know what if you want to put in my big thing as I want to make sure that's somehow

465
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,920
We can attach this opml show notes file

466
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,320
To each podcast which is an MP3 and and basically

467
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:19,960
I have no I had no fucking clue on how to do that and you know just a I'm just a guy who kind of put some scripts and strings and stuff together

468
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
But now that I understand it

469
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:29,640
It's it's really quite simple in fact. I'm gonna be working with with August and Ray who do iPod or X

470
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
Which is the iPod or I use

471
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,840
On hopefully creating a namespace either for production notes or podcasting or you know we're still kind of in

472
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Kind of figuring this out and

473
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Another when we get stuck we can and you will be able to reach out and ask for help

474
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm hoping Dave's gonna watch over my shoulder. I'm sure he will make sure we get this right because

475
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:57,160
It would be so cool to be able to basically make relationships between multiple things in a in a podcast feed

476
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,880
But keeping RSS intact that that's obviously important. I've learned now how important that really is because

477
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,800
Man you the last thing we want to do was create more work for developers, right?

478
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,760
We want to make sure that there's one set wave doing it that we all agree on it as best as possible

479
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,320
I'm sure that you know once we start implementing it

480
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,560
People will we'll help us out and we'll we'll all figure it out together and

481
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,840
And then we'll have some extra functionality in these things. I'm looking forward to that

482
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,520
Working with those guys and I'm just needing a need of a little bit of bandwidth because that's that's really holding me back on

483
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Jumping back into the iPod or developer list and and really getting deep into stuff because it just takes so long to manage all the information

484
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,520
And oh I forgot to say about the BBC

485
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,680
I think that the BBC is doing more podcasting experiments than we're aware of

486
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,080
Andrew Whitehurst sent me an email also in the podcast show notes opml

487
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,400
He sent me a couple of links a particularly for the five live program, which is BBC five

488
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I think it's the late night show

489
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Fighting talk is that it hold on have the

490
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
You were all here. I just check

491
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Oh, excuse me for my stomach

492
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,000
Fighting talk next and I give us a weekly Punditary contest of gladiatorial

493
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,840
Proportions hosted by christianocony so what they have here is okay. This is the deal. They have these

494
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,560
Downloads so they're doing MP3 downloads and if you hunt around

495
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:41,400
Basically trying on different URLs that end in dot XML you'll find that a lot of these programs already have podcast feeds it's almost like there

496
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,560
I don't know if this is a concerted effort or I mean something clearly someone is doing this someone knows what's going on

497
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,280
And I hope that they'll reach out to us and and let us know because I really want to point to these podcasts

498
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
I mean this is the stuff that

499
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:00,600
You know, this is if we can get all that BBC programming in in podcast form and maybe the stuff that

500
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,920
Doesn't make it on the air. Wow. I mean when it comes to radio BBC totally has that down

501
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
And

502
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,960
Just wanted to mention that Linux questions.org is also working at a podcast thanks to

503
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,760
Martin for

504
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,280
Learning me to that by email and one last

505
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,120
I potter feed. I think you should subscribe to

506
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,320
Which I put a link to the

507
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,920
To the RSS 2.0 feed in the show notes is I potio and I potio is interesting

508
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,680
because it's basically a collection of

509
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,480
Audio that can be freely used and redistributed so it's sometimes it's the president's address the weekly radio address

510
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,600
You know, I never go to whitehouse.gov and click on that, you know, so I'd love that coming in automatically

511
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
There's voice of America reports

512
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:05,640
All kinds of just different interesting things and the guy that runs this I think yeah, this is so I'm thinking of actually we we spoke on Skype a while back

513
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
as a Thomas I think

514
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Real fuzzy so I apologize

515
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
If I got that wrong

516
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,280
He has a like a medium size ISP and he's well, he's looking for ways to fill up his pipe and I think I potio is great

517
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,480

518
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
