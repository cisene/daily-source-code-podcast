00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good afternoon friends, family, world leaders, welcome to the Daily Source Code for Wednesday.

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Oh boy, I got a couple of songs to play for you.

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Lots of examples of new podcasts and little bits I want to...

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
That's Jesse, my dog, giving me a little message there.

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I don't know how long the show is going to be until I'm actually done with it, but hold

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
on a second.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Come on, Jesse.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Come outside.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Come here.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Come here.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Just in time.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm only starting the show.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
That's our dog Jesse now.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Ouch.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Okay.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,500
So I was thinking, just looking at the amount of time I spent on the preparation for

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,500
today's show.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll just leave the door open, you guys can do that all yourself like it.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, so I was thinking about the amount of time that goes into preparing a source code.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Today about an hour and a half I'd have to say, and that's, you know, during the day

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I save stuff, I save emails, I save files that I find.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have a special playlist and iTunes, the stuff that comes in through iPod or in iTunes,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I drag into a source code playlist so that I can kind of remember where I have,

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
where I've stashed everything. Do you hear these dogs they're going nuts today?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, anyway. So I thought, you know, this has to be compensated somehow.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So today's daily source code is brought to you by Grandmaster View.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And let me tell you about Grandmaster View and let me put a disclaimer in.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I own a part of the company. I'm a minority shareholder.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Grandmaster View, it's a new way of watching. It's brand new flat screens.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Flat screen TV technology that is so smart, it'll blow.

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
you away. And you can also buy them in the United States. So I'll talk about that in

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
a sec. But just briefly about these flat screens. Some of you may know that I made an investment

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
in this company a while back. What happened is these, and I didn't invent this. This is

34
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
a Dutch invention made in the Netherlands. And also, currently, the production line is

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,500
in the Netherlands. You know, with the advent of plasma screens and LCD screens and all

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,500
this technology that's made television.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
And granted with plasma, there's a lot of disadvantages.

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
It's about, what is it?

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Over 100 pounds that you have to hang on your wall.

40
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
There's always an ugly wire coming down.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
The screens are, they only have a certain lifespan.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
And it's very expensive to replace those.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
The cost of a screen, like a plasma screen,

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
is very expensive.

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
The size is limited.

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
They just don't get as big as you might want

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
for your home cinema if you were using as a home cinema.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
And I hooked up with these guys, Grandmaster View.

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:26,500
And they showed me a flat screen that was 2 meters 20

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
diagonally.

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
So that's about seven feet.

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
And it looked to me like a plasma screen.

53
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I couldn't understand it.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
And there were no wires.

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,500
It was hanging up.

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
They even had a nice little ambient light behind it.

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
It was against the wall, but just a little bit

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
set off from the wall with a light.

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
And it's.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
just looks so cool and the price tag was something like 2,000 euros so say two

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and a half thousand dollars I said now you know clearly a zero dropped off it

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
should be 25,000 for this size and even that may not be enough. So here's the

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
trick about Gram MasterView and why I like it so much. In the past at least

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the past eight or nine years there's been a lot of development going on in

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
projectors. Projector technology has gotten really good we're outputting

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you know a standard projector that you just buy or you know anywhere at any almost

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
at any appliance store is going to give you probably more than a thousand ANSI

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
lumens of light and that's an enormous amount just a couple years ago was you

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
know you barely get 500 and you can get a lot more than that and people do buy

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
much higher intensity projectors because the screens have barely changed so you

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
probably catching on to me by now that what these guys did is they developed

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
a better screen they came up with a special coating which of course is you

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
know that

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,500
the secret sauce of the company and they produce this beautiful flat, it's a, I call it wood,

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
it's not of course, but it's just a flat screen, they put a beautiful edge around it so it

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,500
has that plasma screen look and the reflection that you get from this, you can watch these

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
screens during the day with the

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They're perfect for business, but I have one at home.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've had one for over a year now.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I love it.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I love it so much that I bought a piece of the company.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So Grand Master View, grandmasterview.com, if you're in the Netherlands, we have an

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
American affiliate now, very proud of that, and you can read everything about Grand

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Master View.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
florida.grammasterview.com.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
florida.grammasterview.com.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
All right, that's it for the commercial portion of the show.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now let's get on to some religion, everybody.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Put your hands on your iPod and seal the power.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
My friends all have horses.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I must make amends.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Worked hard on my lifetime.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No help from my friends.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Color TV?

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because dialing $4 is trying to find me.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I wait for delivery each day until three.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Color TV?

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because I'm counting on.

102
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
you lord please don't let me down

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,500
read that you love me and buy the next round

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,500
oh lord won't you buy me a night on the town everybody

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,500
oh

106
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:58,500
me. Hey Mercedes Benz, my friends all have horses. I must make amends. Worked hard all

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:10,500
my lifetime. No help from my friends. Oh Lord, hold your body. Hey Mercedes Benz.

108
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
my iTunes this morning. That's where I got everything for today's show, by the way, except

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,500
for one song which is a request, which, oh gee, I had to go all the way to LimeWire. I

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,500
went to our podcast library and was able to download it in seconds. That later on, after

111
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,500
a double shot of prayer then, man, I hope Lord buys me a Mercedes Benz. All my friends

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,500
have Porsches. Look at the mailbag. I got an email from Tom Pole, that's P-O-H-L,

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
and then we had all those Mac problems. He sent me a brief note and said,

114
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
it could be that your hard drive is failing. Very possible. It always seems

115
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
when you're using big files and doing all this kind of stuff that your hard

116
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
drive does. It's the first thing that has moving bits, so I guess that's where

117
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,500
it's why it's prone to breaking first. It says there's a great utility called

118
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Smart Reporter that will check the physical health of your hard drive. You

119
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
can find it on version trackers. Smart Reporter. I'm definitely going to check

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,500
it out and see what it is. I figured I cut the source code first for today

121
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
before I go fucking with my art.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
drive, which is probably a smart idea. And this is also stuff that not only will I point

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to all of these links along with the posting of the source code, but also a lot of them

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
are listed on iPodder.org.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
on that. The directory of shows is current. You can add your own show. There's a link.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Just click on that, fill out the details and all I basically have to do is just make sure it's added,

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
make sure it's what everyone really says it is.

128
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Clearly we have an intruder in the house.

129
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Uh...

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Yeah.

131
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
That would be our handyman.

132
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Let's see what he's doing.

133
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Hey Luke!

134
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Can I get help, eh?

135
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Eh?

136
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Oh boy, hold on a second. This is Belgian.

137
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
What?

138
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
A sponge?

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I don't know what sponge it is.

140
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Did you look at the garage?

141
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Or at the stairs to the basement?

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Okay, close the door, Lucas.

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm just recording, don't laugh.

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Thank you.

145
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Okay.

146
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Well, he was looking for a sponge.

147
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
And I'm happy to interrupt the show for that.

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,500
So, another link I'm pointing to is from Mark van de Vettering.

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
His site is brainwagon.org.

150
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,500
We've had Hugo show us how to set up our Macs to do a podcast.

151
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,500
And he's got a whole rundown of ways you can do this on Windows.

152
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
We've been waiting for this.

153
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
So, that's also an iPod.org.

154
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Again, as I said, I'm getting that together.

155
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Now, what we really need is a different look for iPod.org.

156
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
It looks kind of lame, actually.

157
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Um...

158
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Let me see.

159
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
How did I have all of this set up?

160
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Here we go.

161
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
I want...

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I wanted to play a little bit, oh wait a minute,

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
there's another thing that I had here.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And remember we were talking about,

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
about all how settings podcasts up

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and how do we route audio and geez,

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
not like we haven't been talking this for quite a bit.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Got an email from Tim Ayello,

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
spelled like the actor's name I guess.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Adam, been a while, listen to your podcasts.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He says, when it comes to the voice applications,

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
he says you may want to look at the gaming world.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I hadn't thought about this.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He says, for instance, voice apps,

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
TeamSpeak and then Trillo might be used

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
for being able to get a bunch of people in

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and talking all at once with very good quality.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Cause this is what the gamers are doing.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The gamers are playing online and,

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you know, they're, so they're using high CPU

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
intensity applications and they're talking to each other.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So it seems like,

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
like there's some stuff out there,

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
it's just that we have to,

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we have to connect these worlds together.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I'm glad I got this, this email from Tim.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So hopefully if you can help us out,

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
here's some information on Tim.

189
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,500
TeamSpeak has a client recording facility, I believe it only pumps out a dot wave.

190
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Well, okay, we can always convert that.

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,500
It has both Windows and Linux clients and servers are available for Windows, Linux,

192
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X.

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
It hasn't tried Ventrilo yet, but I think that's really interesting.

194
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,500
And I'm glad that we're going to try and incorporate some of these

195
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
complete different communities and also have some GeekSpeak coming up

196
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
from the board game GeekGuys, a little bit of their show that I wanted to play for you.

197
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,500
And something else that showed up on the iPod this morning, thanks to the iPodder.

198
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
It's another political song, it's another mix.

199
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
It's the trigger-happy single mix.

200
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
We're going to give you a dictatorship.

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
In the name of freedom, we're going to take yours away.

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,500
In the name of liberty, we are going to give you the Royal Chef.

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Give up this offer, do it on your own Don't kill me anymore baby, baby, you're not

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
hiding my hope

205
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,500
I like to think that the mind you left them must take hello

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
You turn to your barrel on yourself baby.

207
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Right wing, left wing.

208
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I like chicken wing.

209
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Die for the world.

210
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Die for your country.

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
I'll make a generous gift to your...

212
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Thanks for nothing.

213
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
How can you leave yourself?

214
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
I'll have a pabbler on the raise that is worth my un-call.

215
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Well,

216
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I will change my hands.

217
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Through time,

218
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I will change my mind.

219
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I will change my hands.

220
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Through time,

221
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I will change my mind.

222
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I will change my hands.

223
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Through time,

224
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I will change my mind.

225
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
I will change my mind.

226
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
I will change my mind.

227
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I will change my mind.

228
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I will change my mind.

229
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I will change my mind.

230
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
I will change my mind.

231
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I will change my mind.

232
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I will change my mind.

233
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I will change my mind.

234
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I will change my mind.

235
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I will change my mind.

236
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I will change my mind.

237
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I will change my mind.

238
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I will change my mind.

239
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Don't forget your hat!

240
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
No one's coming for you though!

241
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Why back the camera guy?

242
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, it's your cousin's hat!

243
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
What happened to them, baby?

244
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
You ain't been over the phone!

245
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
This is kinda like day-shot over phone.

246
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
No one's been having that good of a while, come on.

247
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
You from the Post Office?

248
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm getting out of here.

249
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah.

250
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Trigger Happy. Too bad about the quality.

251
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
While I was playing I checked it out.

252
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,500
It's a sample that's 48 kilohertz, which is just not enough.

253
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
And I think it sounds really muddled and you're not able to hear all the world.

254
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,500
with Iraq I recupation you know you gotta appreciate that so hopefully we can find out who did

255
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,500
that get a better quality mp3 of the song that would be most awesome great song I really like

256
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
the good tune could have used a little bit more cowbell and you remember just the other

257
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
day maybe you don't maybe didn't hear Dave and I were talking about song

258
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
And I said, you know, Beatles, man, you just don't hear enough Beatles.

259
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
And I don't know if this is just what's out in the air,

260
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
or if it's, you know, if it's buzzing around,

261
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
but I listened to Geek Speak,

262
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
trying podcasts about gaming,

263
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
and lo and behold, here's how it started off.

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She's got a ticket to ride She's got a ticket to ride

265
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hey, welcome to GeekSpeak.

266
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We're up to episode three.

267
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Episode three.

268
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Cool.

269
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

270
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
All right.

271
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What are we talking to this week, maybe?

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, well, I'm Scott Alden.

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I'm Dirk.

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Actually, I'm Aldi.

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm Aldi on the show.

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

278
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
All right.

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You say so.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's interesting.

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
In Europe, we have two supermarket chains.

282
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
One is called Dirk for Dirk von der Brug, but we call it Dirk.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And the other one, which is a German one, is called, You Got It.

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Aldi.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So, this episode, we have Mark Kaufman and Eric Hauptmann from Days of Wonder, the publishing

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
company that has recently come out with a couple of winner games from the German game

287
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
of the year, the Spieldizar.

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah.

289
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Take it to ride.

290
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah.

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And also Memoir 44, which just won the two-player IGA award.

292
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So, if you want to hear more about that, definitely check out GeekSpeak.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a great podcast.

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can get to it from the iPod.org show's directory.

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
GeekSpeak is the name of the show.

296
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
the show.

297
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
And so there you go.

298
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
There's a new game coming out or just came out called Ticket to Ride.

299
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
But I love this podcast.

300
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
You might not understand Jack all about what they're talking about because they're in their

301
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
industry.

302
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
They are in the gaming industry.

303
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
They're talking about the new games.

304
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
They know what you should see.

305
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Their website.

306
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
It's amazing, by the way, geekspeak.com.

307
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
So this is just complimentary to what they were already doing.

308
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
But now they're interviewing the game designers.

309
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
And I'm just tickled by that.

310
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I think it's great.

311
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,500
The thing I played for you a while ago was Northwest Noise.

312
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
And I just want to recap that this was three days before the big media caught on about Mount

313
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
St. Helens.

314
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,500
He reported that Northwest Noise is only about the Washington and Oregon region.

315
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
That's Northwest Noise.

316
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,500
That's what Northwest Noise is chosen as their audience.

317
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Although if you have any affinity with it, it could be interesting to have a family

318
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
there.

319
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
But he said, you know, there's some word about some rumblings going on deep in St. Helens.

320
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,500
And he had this big spiel about how the previous eruption happened before.

321
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
She was born and really had only had concerns about that.

322
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
50 or 60 people died during that eruption.

323
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This was three days before big media started reporting on the fact that it could erupt,

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and lo and behold, it did.

325
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I didn't listen to all of Northwest Noyes.

326
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't know if there's a report later on about what they're expecting.

327
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He kind of had me going for a second because we have a reporter on the scene at Mount St.

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Helens and well clearly that caught my interest.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I do do on the air reporting from location.

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So let's let's queue up his latest escapades up there in Mount St. Helens.

331
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So I hate Tim. How you doing?

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey there!

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm in the crater again.

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He's bastard.

335
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He's stoned me.

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Take a second look.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
See how it's doing down here.

338
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
you get the picture. But if you want to know anything about the northwestern

339
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
region of the United States, North with no

340
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
to pronounce, but a great podcast.

341
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Something else I've been keeping track of is a podcast called Career Opportunities.

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Again, you can get to...

343
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
career opportunities is really about just what it is.

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Your career, how you can advance your career, stuff to watch out for in a corporate environment.

345
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I ran a public company.

346
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Certainly, well, let's say I ran the New York office of a public company and was one

347
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
of the co-founders of it.

348
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And there's a lot you got to think about.

349
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Certainly in the States.

350
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And there was a bit that he had on the...

351
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think this is an archive of something he's done before, but it came through on my

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
iPod today.

353
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The title of this is Keep It To Yourself.

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And you'll probably recognize some of these situations.

355
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Despite the fact that companies are trying to become more like a family and less like

356
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
a cold corporation, it's always best to remember that there are certain aspects of your life

357
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
that you shouldn't share with your coworkers or your managers.

358
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The stories you tell now may come back to haunt your career in the future.

359
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For the years, I've been on the receiving end of many stories I would have rather not

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
known.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
These include graphic descriptions of...

362
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,500
drunken nights on the town, sexual adventures, and quasi-legal activities.

363
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,500
While you might want to share your adventures, your coworkers probably aren't the best audience.

364
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,500
It's a simple truth in any industry that you are never sure who you might end up working

365
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
for down the road.

366
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Today's intern might end up running a hot new startup, or you could be laid off and

367
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
end up following a coworker to a new company.

368
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,500
The entertainment industry describes it in this way.

369
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Whoever you stepped on getting to the top will be kicking you all the way down.

370
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
As you can imagine, people can be reluctant to hire someone who has a history of heavy

371
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
drinking or drug use.

372
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Except in the podcast industry.

373
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,500
That it's too risky to their professional reputation to bring you into their company.

374
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
They might be afraid that your actions would reflect badly on them.

375
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Okay, you gotta listen to it.

376
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
You can listen to it two ways.

377
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
It's great sound advice, but it's also funny when you...

378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
scenarios that you can run into.

379
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And haven't we all run to them at one point or another?

380
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We're about 23 minutes into this daily source code for Wednesday, October 6, 2004.

381
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And Dave Weiner finally posted a morning coffee notes.

382
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's been, I think, about a week and I understand why because he's been busy.

383
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He's been doing trade secrets with me.

384
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We've been talking a lot about iPod and podcasting and he was up at the Microsoft conference.

385
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think there was a Web 2.0 conference, but he also went to this.

386
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I believe there were some get together that Microsoft invited a number of bloggers to come

387
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
look at something they were presenting.

388
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And of course, it's all under NDA, so I have no idea what it is.

389
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And Dave made reference to David Weinberger in his morning coffee notes.

390
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And something really interesting.

391
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Dave makes a real good point about privacy and the fact that we really are just kind

392
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
of getting used to what we have.

393
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And if we ever really want to make the internet work the way...

394
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,500
we all dream it works, we have to figure out some of this privacy stuff.

395
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,500
And it's certainly interesting to hear Dave champion Microsoft a little bit, or maybe more

396
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
than a little bit in these thoughts that he has about privacy.

397
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Now actually the Morning Coffee Notes is about a whole bunch of things.

398
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:24,500
He also goes through the history of desktop publishing, to web logs, to podcasts, which

399
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
is really, it's a good listen.

400
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
So check that out.

401
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
The show is about 45 minutes.

402
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
But I want to play this one bit where he talks about privacy.

403
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
It's about four minutes.

404
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,500
And he hooked up with David Weinberger, who you've probably heard from, or heard of,

405
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
at Microsoft.

406
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
And they had this conversation.

407
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,500
And here's Dave's version of the conversation and his conclusions.

408
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Weinberger and I, it's funny because at a philosophical level, I've said this

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
to him before that.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We are in total agreement on the philosophy of the web and we're actually gonna have a session on this at blogger con called the core

411
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Values of the web the idea there has to be led by Mary hotter

412
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
From Berkeley, and I think she's now at Technorati also

413
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and

414
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's an academic subject. It's question of well. What is at one point? I was when I went to Amsterdam

415
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I went to the W3C meeting in Amsterdam. I think was in it was in

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,000
2000 yeah, I was in 2000 and I I wrote about that saying I was looking for the heart of the web and didn't find it

417
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's okay. I mean at one point that was the heart of the web

418
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But the but the web had moved on and was a lot more than that at that time

419
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And it of course is today even more than that

420
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but the web does have a heart and it does have a philosophy and

421
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And we're sort of like the blind men and the elephant and elephant

422
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We're all sort of looking at different parts of it and Weinberger is one of those people and he's written some great books

423
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,500
you know, small pieces loosely joined is one of his books and of course the Clutrain Manifesto,

424
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,500
which I think is one side of the coin and the other side of the coin is blogs.

425
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,500
And we seem to be, you know, I was a math major and in math, very theoretical type of math, not,

426
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,500
you know, and in math the great thing about math, the reason why people love who do math,

427
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:38,500
love math is because there's this sort of, you can approach a theorem from five different approaches,

428
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:45,500
you can always end up at the same place. And it shows you that something that it's very hard to

429
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:51,500
describe in words, other than to say that this is what beauty is. Beauty is where you discover

430
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:59,500
the underlying law that explains the nature of something that one wouldn't necessarily think

431
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,500
has an underlying law that and the web is like that.

432
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The web, the essential element of the web is the link.

433
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And it goes all the way from the deepest technology,

434
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
all the way up to the simplest user interface,

435
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
that where you link, you're like the web.

436
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Where you are exclusive, when you don't link,

437
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
you are not like the web.

438
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So, Weinberger and I agree on everything,

439
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but today, or actually it was yesterday,

440
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
we found something that we don't agree on,

441
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and I think I'm right, and I think he's wrong.

442
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So I thought, wow, this is a momentous occasion.

443
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let's celebrate it.

444
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Of course, I think I'm right, and I think that if,

445
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
in a short while, he will agree with me,

446
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
because I once was where he is.

447
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He asked a question, he said,

448
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
will this require the use of passport?

449
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And the Microsoft person said yes.

450
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And he said, well, then I won't use it.

451
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And that's certainly a place where I...

452
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,500
was once and and no I don't have a passport. On the other hand I'm probably

453
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,500
going to give in and get one and there's a reason for that because the world has

454
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
changed. First of all when we were against it there was this idea that we

455
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
would all work together and we would create something that was open and

456
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:29,500
democratic and not controlled by a major monolithic antitrust violating you

457
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:37,500
know convicted company that couldn't be trusted you know and all that's very

458
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
valid and it's still valid and this is how Microsoft screwed not just

459
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,500
themselves but all of us do because they should have been much more careful

460
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,500
about earning and keeping our trust or not just our trust but deserving of

461
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,500
trust and no we would be wrong to trust them but on the other hand we would be

462
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:06,500
even wronger not to do something about identity theft do something about it

463
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
take some step to protect yourself.

464
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
In another conversation I said to one of the people

465
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
at the conference, I said, you know,

466
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
let's create a hardened laptop.

467
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Let's create one where if I lose the laptop or it's stolen,

468
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
they don't automatically get all my sensitive information

469
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
off there.

470
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Why is this a concern?

471
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Because more and more our financial affairs

472
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
are moving on to the internet.

473
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's just too convenient and there are too many incentives

474
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
for us to do it.

475
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Businesses, you know, will give us a few points off

476
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
if we are willing to move all of our business

477
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
on the internet because it's cheaper for them

478
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
to not have to print out and mail out invoices.

479
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And they're willing to share the savings on that.

480
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
At some point, you're not even gonna have

481
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the option of getting paper.

482
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You're gonna have to do it electronically.

483
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And at that point we're all gonna be very vulnerable.

484
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And mass, mass hijackings of identity.

485
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
will be taking place.

486
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
I think we're going to record a show today.

487
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
And I just saw that he's no longer idling in Seattle

488
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
through iChat.

489
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
So that means he's awake.

490
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
So after this show, we'll probably

491
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,500
record trade secrets.

492
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
But that is true.

493
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:33,500
And wow.

494
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
And you know what?

495
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,500
In the Netherlands, as of January 2005, all

496
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:46,500
It's mandatory for all tax returns to be done electronically.

497
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,500
And this, of course, has become a big deal because not everyone can file their tax returns

498
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
electronically.

499
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
So of course, now there's companies that will do that for you that kind of sit in the middle,

500
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
but that's a big, that's a giant step.

501
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
And the government did it.

502
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Excuse me.

503
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
government did it, as they say themselves, to reduce cost.

504
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But yeah, so it's a tax return.

505
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's a little different than a bank account.

506
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But is it really?

507
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
What kind of information are you sending over the wire that can just be picked up by anybody?

508
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Now I see that we're already 30 minutes into the show and I still have a number of things

509
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I want to do.

510
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm going to skip over a bit.

511
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I was going to play a bit from the Audio Activism podcast, but I'll save that for tomorrow's

512
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
show because it's kind of a whole different topic, but it's really a podcast about political

513
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
issues.

514
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And then I just wanted to skip on to a request that I received as Dave and I continue to

515
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
find out what do we want to do with these podcasts and what kind of music do we want

516
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
to play?

517
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So Dave should just do a print show.

518
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It should be the Dave and Print Show, the Dave and Print podcast.

519
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But he also mentioned another group who were probably...

520
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,500
just as important as the Beatles or the Stones or the Kinks.

521
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
I even put the Bee Gees in there.

522
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
If you think back to Bee Gees in late 60s,

523
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,500
they had some different songs than Saturday Night Fever.

524
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,500
So I'm going to, first of all, turn the big podcast antenna

525
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
pointed out to Seattle.

526
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Here's one.

527
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,500
I love the colorful cliché

528
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,500
And the way the sunlight plays upon her head

529
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,500
I like being the sound of a gentle mood

530
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Also wear a bat with super-pun through the air

531
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm taking a look at the vibrations

532
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Good luck, Rachel.

533
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Today's our day's run.

534
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Softly smile, I know she must be fine

535
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
In her eyes, she goes with the two of us

536
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm picking up her pet missions

537
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Goodbye, Rachel

538
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
...

539
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
...

540
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
...

541
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
...

542
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,500
That was in the days when did those quick fadeouts beach boys good vibration

543
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,500
hump in your hump day for Wednesday October 6 2004. Okay, gotta talk a little bit about

544
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,500
iPod. I know that people are getting tired of

545
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
bit to play about that very topic in a couple minutes. Also some comedy on the

546
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
way in the very first Engadget podcast. But hey, this is the place where users and

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
developers party together, right? And we still got some work to do. And I got an

548
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
email which was copied to a number of other people from Ray Slakinski. Now I've

549
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
spoken about Ray before. I'm pretty sure he did the nucleus bit torn client

550
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that I'm using to grab American TV shows. And as soon as he saw the iPod

551
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
or script that I created, the original Apple script, he started making pipe.

552
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And that script was then used by August to create iPodder X, which I love.

553
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I think it's the definitive Mac iPodder client.

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And it just works great in all the new versions.

555
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And Ray goes on to say, you know, so I helped August all the way up to 2.0 with patches.

556
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And at the time he was working on iPodder, which is this great cross-platform effort going on,

557
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
which is coming out pretty soon.

558
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And this is going to work on Mac and Windows and presumably Linux and other platforms.

559
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But this is what's really beautiful about what's going on in this community we have.

560
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And you can become a member just by subscribing to the iPodder developers list.

561
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There's users and developers on there alike.

562
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I actually tally that and see how many people on the list think they're users

563
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and how many think they're developers or how many think they're both.

564
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Here's what Ray says, what I realized, I still really want to

565
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And that means I have to work on the iPodrx side of things.

566
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So he's basically saying goodbye to the iPodr team, wishing them well.

567
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He says, I wish you guys all the best.

568
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Think you're doing a great job and what's going to be the best cross-platform iPodr program.

569
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And so what we're seeing here is that, and this is the beautiful, this is the beauty

570
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
of it, is that Ray just wants to work with August.

571
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's not about having the most successful iPodr.

572
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's not about, I don't think it's about money.

573
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's about wanting to work with someone.

574
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And that's just beautiful when that stuff happens.

575
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So wish Ray and August good luck on the iPodrx.

576
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I got a mail from Michael.

577
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Now this is not an easy name to pronounce.

578
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm going to say, Joaghan, Joagun, Joagun, well it's G-E-O-G-H-E-G-A-N.

579
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Michael, you really have to record an MP3 with the pronunciation of your name.

580
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I had been working just kind of on the side with a couple of developers.

581
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,500
kicking back and forth the idea of, you know, what kind of genre do these podcasts fit into

582
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:08,500
and can you just put into the, when you're doing ID3 tags, so basically that's the metadata,

583
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,500
the information that you package into your MP3 file so that, you know, the name of your

584
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,500
show appears in the playlist.

585
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Well there's also a genre tag in the ID3 spec.

586
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I'm not going to go through the whole thing here, but Michael did a little bit of research.

587
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,500
He says that there, let me see, what is it?

588
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:38,500
There is an organization, TCON, I think, who have basically come up with all these different

589
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:46,500
content types and so I've been just using speech which I think is content type 101.

590
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,500
And Michael gets into this and explains it technologically how apparently we can use

591
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,500
the category and then put a podcast category behind that.

592
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I'm not quite sure how it's...

593
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
to work yet, but the important thing is that we want to be able to categorize, first of all,

594
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
just so that you can say podcast and every other MP3 player will understand, oh, a genre podcast.

595
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And if possible, it would be nice to say genre podcast sports, or music, or finance, or gardening,

596
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
or whatever. And that'll just make it a lot easier for us to categorize stuff and find stuff

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
on the user end, on the receiving end. So you can say, just give me all the,

598
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I want to make a playlist, a smart playlist is what we use in iTunes. I'm sure Windows Media has some.

599
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Just give me all the gardening shows followed by a financial show.

600
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Somewhere in there is some beauty to be found.

601
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
We just got to figure out how we work with, and it's interesting, isn't it, that someone

602
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
or somebody took the time to categorize and say, okay, here's the 200 categories that

603
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
are possible and no one thought about a podcast.

604
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So we got to figure that one out.

605
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Quick bit here from Evil Genius Chronicles.

606
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You know our friend Dave Slusher sitting in South Carolina.

607
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
He's running into some of the same issues that I am on my podcast, so I think I'm doing a

608
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
little bit better today by mixing it up.

609
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Here's his podcast, Evil Genius Chronicles from yesterday.

610
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I got a big long list of stuff to talk about.

611
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
An important point, and we're going to come back to this because it really does actually

612
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
matter, is I'm in Conway, South Carolina.

613
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We're near Myrtle Beach, but it's a little town near Myrtle Beach.

614
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We'll get back to that.

615
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That's like check off with the gun over the map.

616
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,500
piece it will be fired before

617
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I've got some feedback I need to play and this should catch me up on all feedback.

618
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,500
If you've emailed me audio feedback and you haven't heard it as of today,

619
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:55,500
it means I screwed up and forgot to play it. So feel free to send me a message reminding me I never played your feedback.

620
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,500
You don't have to send the file, it's entirely my bookkeeping.

621
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
It's just I forgot where I left off.

622
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,500
And in honor of a new mic configuration, all feedback will be from guys named Mike.

623
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Here we go.

624
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Hi Dave, Michael Gohagen here.

625
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,500
Recently on your show you've mentioned that you feel you might be discussing podcasting and

626
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,500
the whole iPod platform phenomenon almost too much.

627
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,500
And frankly, I don't know how you talk about anything but podcasts.

628
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,500
I mean you have a unique and kind of special situation where you're at the center of something

629
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
that is exploding all around you.

630
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,500
And as it continues to grow, the quality work, the guys like you and Adam and some others are doing,

631
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I just think is so important.

632
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,500
You know, I really think a kind of a critical juncture is coming up here where the podcast

633
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
podcasting community is going to start to get some attention from the outside, from some

634
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
non-technical oriented people.

635
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
When those first looks come from the media and other sources, I think that it's important

636
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
that quality shows like yours and others, some of the other things being produced, are

637
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
kind of at the center and the forefront so that it doesn't get dismissed as some sort

638
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
of amateurish thing going on on the internet.

639
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
As more people get involved in this whole podcasting thing, and it's growing every

640
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
day, I really think that kind of the watch words are going to be that quality is respected,

641
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and participation appreciates.

642
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And I don't know where we're going to be a year from now, but I really think you're

643
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
paving the way.

644
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I know that I am the consummate podcasting consumer.

645
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm downloading these things in the middle of the night, loading them on my

646
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
iPod, listening to them in my car, or when and where I choose on my own schedule.

647
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm not a computer guy.

648
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm not in the technical business, but I get it.

649
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
All right, that's beautiful.

650
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So a couple things about that.

651
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
One, I really like the idea of sending a recorded feedback into a podcast.

652
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,500
and playing that back. Great idea and I encourage you to send that to the daily source code as

653
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:54,500
well. And indeed, now that we're moving a little bit beyond the testing one, two, three, is my

654
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:54,500
trend.

655
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
We've got to start defining what we're doing and what these podcasts are about.

656
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Now, it may very well be that Dave Slusher wants to continue talking about podcasting.

657
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I think that's great because I'd love to say, hey, if you want to know what's going on

658
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
with the latest podcast developments, here's the show you want to check out.

659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Personally, what I want to try and do as I move a little bit away from all the podcasting

660
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
stuff and I still want to try and make it as friendly as possible so that when I talk

661
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
about genres in your playlist, I'm hoping that the non-technical listeners are

662
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
saying, oh yeah, that would be good if I could sort it that way.

663
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So there's always going to be some of that.

664
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But I'm going to try and do what I've always done.

665
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Shit, I've always introduced videos, records, whatever.

666
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So I can do a mix of that and now add it to the mix is podcasts.

667
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And just give you an idea of what's out there.

668
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And of course, I want to point you to where you can subscribe to these.

669
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And then instead of getting out the URLs, and there's been a lot of discussion there,

670
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
what's the best way to talk about URLs in an audience?

671
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,500
show and a podcast or radio show, well that really is... excuse me. So the best way is

672
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,500
just to... anything I talk about, any shows I talk about will be in the podcast directory

673
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,500
on iPodder.org. Something I came across that was a nice complimentary podcast to an existing

674
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,500
blog is from...

675
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,500
photo blog and I've gotten a little bit into photo blogs. I'm not talking about a

676
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,500
mobile blog where you send stuff from your camera. I'm talking about real, you

677
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,500
know, the digital photography, beautiful pictures, settings and if you're into that

678
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,500
you'll know that with most modern-day cameras when they take a picture a lot

679
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,500
of information is encoded into that picture about what camera was used, what

680
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,500
shutter speed, what setting and so you know this so you don't have to write

681
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,500
all this down it just it's captured right into the picture and so there's a

682
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,500
great number of communities that are sharing this type of information and

683
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,500
just a quick bit from his podcast it was titled Monty Woods and it has to do

684
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,500
with a particular picture that he took.

685
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Hello and welcome to my photo blog.

686
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Today I'm going to do something different.

687
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm going to post a picture and make some comments on it.

688
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:28,500
And attach this audio file to it and see if this generates some interest.

689
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Of course this could also be deep thoughts with Jack Handy.

690
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Or have some value for the viewers of my photo blog.

691
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The photo is titled, Double Rainbow over Monty's Woods.

692
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
This picture was taken a couple weeks ago.

693
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So you clearly understand how the community can benefit from this type of podcast.

694
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And also if you're just into yoga and want to relax, it's a great podcast to check out.

695
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I was really pleased to see the first Engadget podcast up here on the scene.

696
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The Engadget guys not only did they put their first podcast together, but they also did yet

697
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
another setup and explanation very detailed with all the right links.

698
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Engadget.com that's E-N-G-A-D-G-E-T dot com of course.

699
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:37,500
from this post from iPodder. And Gadget is already by itself just a great web log. These

700
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,500
guys basically have all the latest stuff on the latest gadgets and they've got secret

701
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,500
insight information. Sometimes they even get in trouble with these companies because

702
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,500
the traditional way of reviewing new gadgets is you leak something to your favorite reporter

703
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,500
and then maybe they'll get a picture about

704
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,500
And the trade shows, they're taking pictures behind with little camera phones.

705
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
They're getting intel from the Far East.

706
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,500
And this really pisses off a lot of companies.

707
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,500
get enough of this stuff. So they've already got a very established community going on.

708
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:22,500
They're now, as a part of the gadgetry, they decided to set up a podcast system, do it with

709
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,500
as much open source of free software as possible. And even that took them well over three hours

710
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
and they had some good examples there from the stuff that Hugo Schochmann has done.

711
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
talking about. They got it all together with an interesting new way of connecting all the

712
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
bits by the way. So I might try that out on a show soon because they basically did a show

713
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
together through iChat. Quality isn't quite perfect yet but I think that has more to

714
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
do with the microphones than the setup. It's like at least one of the mics with the internal

715
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
mic because I think I can hear the fan noise which is, that's kind of the way it works

716
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
with the, I love the power book. So you have two speakers built into the power book

717
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and the internal mic is actually in the left speaker and so of course if you're

718
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
doing an iChat and someone's talking then if you're using the internal mic it's

719
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
gonna you know it's gonna hear that speaker and it's gonna send that person's

720
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
voice right back and that wouldn't have been very good so Apple came up with a

721
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
brilliant solution and what you first think of is oh this voice filtering.

722
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What they did is when you're doing an iChat the left speaker is disabled and

723
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
this person comes through the right speaker. It's very...

724
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
typical bootstrap fix there.

725
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,500
So of course I listened to their first podcast

726
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,500
and these guys are all over, they're smart,

727
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,500
they know what's going on,

728
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,500
they know that there's business to be done with podcasting

729
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
and they were talking about it.

730
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,500
And with like the FCC even coming down on Howard Stern,

731
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,500
why not just ride around that and offer subscriptions

732
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,500
or figure out ways.

733
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
And I guess that'll be the next thing

734
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
is how to make money on this.

735
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeah, I'm sure we'll see some of that coming out.

736
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
You can, like you said, I mean,

737
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,500
the FCC's involvement in actually being proactive

738
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
about monitoring and censoring content,

739
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,500
it actually changes the game here

740
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
kind of like how satellite radio did

741
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,500
with letting people pay for what they wanna hear.

742
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
And in some ways this goes a step further

743
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
unless people create what they wanna hear.

744
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
I mean, if you listen to some of the broadcasts

745
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,500
for being created, whether it's Doc Searle's Linux show

746
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,500
or Adam's broadcast with the Daily Source Code,

747
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
I mean, Adam, it's really interesting.

748
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
This is a guy who's a professional broadcaster, right?

749
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
He was on TV and...

750
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I think he's enjoying this sense of freedom to be able to go say what he wants and do what

751
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
he wants.

752
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
In fact, the other day I was listening to it, I don't know if you've noticed this, do

753
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
you listen to his show?

754
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah, I've listened to three of them since I started poking around on this.

755
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Okay.

756
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So I've been listening to them all and the amazing thing is Adam actually smells mad

757
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
weed on the air.

758
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And so the really funny thing is you're sitting there and all of a sudden you hear

759
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
a lighter flick and a bull start or a bong start going in the background and Adam's

760
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
sitting there taking hits on the air.

761
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
He's talking about whatever he wants.

762
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
He's swearing, he's doing all this crazy stuff.

763
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And you know, you just think about what he's doing.

764
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
He's running his own media and his listeners.

765
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So it's kind of busted him out into his own thing.

766
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, I can't imagine having to pitch that as a show idea to someone.

767
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So here's the thing.

768
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's atmosphere, city, and house.

769
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Smoke and weed, talking about technology.

770
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And he gives away the content at the end of the show.

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
People are downloading it.

772
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
They can do it right.

773
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
What do you think?

774
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I can see them going to the programming director.

775
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So we're going to do this show where I call up Dave Winer

776
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
and we smoke weed on the phone and talk about technology

777
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and whatever else.

778
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,000
No, no.

779
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It's the graduate meets easy riders.

780
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And then we play songs in weird remixes and mash-ups

781
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
of George Bush.

782
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Exactly.

783
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So I have some technology stories

784
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
that I kind of bookmarked for this broadcast.

785
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
If you want to talk about a couple fun things,

786
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
a couple of interesting things.

787
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
One of them is it's just a prediction.

788
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I think speaking of iPods and this.

789
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:24,500
broadcasting thing. There's some rumors about whether there's going to be a flash

790
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
base iPod and flash bases and non hard drive.

791
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,500
So there you go already straight into some good news and some tidbits there.

792
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:41,500
iPod and I think that's actually confirmed but listen to the Engadget podcast for more information on that and just a few notes about that

793
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Now first of all you have to know I was raised in the Netherlands born in the States who moved here when I was seven and I remember quite well

794
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Just to give you an idea of the culture of Europe and how that differs immediately media from the States

795
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,500
I'll never forget there was a show on the television in 1972

796
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Television in Netherlands consisted of two channels two national channels

797
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,500
They started at 7 p.m. With the news on both channels identical news was very much like Russia and

798
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,500
It ended around 11 30 with a clock, you know and then it went over to the

799
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:18,500
To the test pattern that was it time to go to bed make babies whatever come on good people of the lowlands go to bed

800
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:24,500
And I'll never forget that like 7 30 there was the show on once or twice a week called chef on ukul's

801
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Thing was disco show or whatever, but it was it was a wacky show

802
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
It was kind of like Benny Hill

803
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,500
In a way like yeah a bit of Benny Hill except the girl

804
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
that are running around are naked.

805
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'll never forget my parents.

806
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Here we are, this all-American family.

807
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And 730, I'm sitting there with my sister going,

808
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
dude, check this out.

809
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
What is going on?

810
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I thought this was going to suck this movie.

811
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
This is a great country.

812
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So the human body is considered something that can be shown.

813
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Another part of the culture, in the Netherlands at least, not all over Europe, is that

814
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
people have their curtains wide open during the day.

815
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Please look into my house.

816
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I want you to feel welcome.

817
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
When they're closed means you're not welcome, of course.

818
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And obviously, when it comes to drug policy, who are we kidding?

819
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Who are we kidding?

820
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So I am totally enjoying this freedom.

821
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm used to a lot of this freedom.

822
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm used to being able to...

823
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What swear words am I really using?

824
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I'm used to being myself.

825
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
That's the morning radio show I did.

826
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I think part of the success of that.

827
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,500
for a year was because I was just being myself, just shooting the breeze.

828
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Howard Stern is the same.

829
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,500
It may be one part of Howard Stern, but he's just being himself and he's saying what he's

830
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,500
thinking and he's saying hey, nice boobies, you know, because he means it.

831
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
And I think that's what people like, is honesty.

832
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:00,500
We're so fucking tired of, you know, television screaming at us and editing in effects, particularly

833
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,500
editing, you know, concealing the real truth behind what happened.

834
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:03,500
All the reality shit.

835
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
from hours of tape and sound effects are put in and voiceovers, all to position you and

836
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
help your brain understand the story that they're trying to tell.

837
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And people I think, that's why people go back to theater.

838
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
That's why actors go back to theater.

839
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
They want to have something real that's live and it's just not exciting after a while.

840
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And I think that's what's happened with radio and I think that's why we're here

841
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
with podcasts.

842
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
The only freedom I haven't enjoyed, mind you, even in the very liberal United States

843
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
of Europe, which still doesn't have a constitution, is freedom of choice of music.

844
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Now at MTV in the beginning we could say a lot more, but at a certain point it was you

845
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
can't rag on any artists.

846
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You can't say Alana Miles, yeah, she's Miss Doug Morris who works for Atlantic Records.

847
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
You couldn't say that.

848
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
That was a big no-no.

849
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You know, in fact we had to say Michael Jackson, the king of pop.

850
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Did I ever tell you that story?

851
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
That MTV has always been pre-recorded except for some of the live events.

852
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And on Thursday we record for Saturday and Sunday.

853
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
On Friday we record for months.

854
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
So it was a double shift on Thursday.

855
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
We had to do two shows worth.

856
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,500
So a lot of the VJs are there.

857
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
It's one after another.

858
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,500
We're taping these segments.

859
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,500
We didn't ever see the videos while we were taping, right?

860
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Those were in.

861
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Long Island.

862
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And so it was Michael Jackson weekend, all a part of the big Michael Jackson will only

863
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
appear on the Video Music Awards if we make Michael Jackson.

864
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And we all had to come back on Friday and do three shifts.

865
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So including Mondays, we had to do Saturday and Sunday over again because part of the deal

866
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that was negotiated between MTV and Michael Jackson is that every single time we would

867
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
use his name, you would have to comma, pause and say the king of pot.

868
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
So it had to be Michael Jackson, the king of pot.

869
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That freedom wasn't there to say Michael Jackson, who is still probably a really good musician

870
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
but looks so fucking freaky.

871
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And even on the radio, the radio stations need to have some kind of automation.

872
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
They need to have some kind of playlist so that it's the way radio works in today's

873
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
commercial environment.

874
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
If you're talking top 40 stations, they're really only playing 100 records, if even that.

875
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And they just repeat them over and over and over again because the top 40 station, your

876
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
average listening time is 15 minutes, if that.

877
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And it better be a number one hit song playing when you tune in or a big hit from a recurrent

878
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
about 8 to 10 years ago.

879
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Now other types of stations have a much like an easy listening or a mix, the best of

880
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
the 70s, 80s and 90s.

881
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They'll have a little broader playlist but still you can't have the disc jockeys or the

882
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
air talent choosing the records all the time because you may get some weird doubles.

883
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And of course all about control.

884
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,500
know, there's business behind the records that are played.

885
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
So I've never been in control of what I wanted to play.

886
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Yeah, you can always do one yourself.

887
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
You can always switch stuff around the playlist if you want to.

888
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,500
If you know the music directly.

889
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But you never had that freedom.

890
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And now not only do I have the freedom to do that,

891
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
but I have a library at my disposal

892
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
that is so humongous.

893
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I've got everything, the Beach Boys.

894
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I want to get some Beach Boys.

895
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I had good vibrations, but it was like a shitty MP3.

896
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Only one minute of it.

897
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Went to LimeWire, downloaded it, ready to go.

898
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But it's not just for that.

899
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There's podcasts will be archived

900
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
and will be stored on peer-to-peer networks.

901
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It's a beautiful thing.

902
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So back to the words, the cuss words, et cetera.

903
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I think the only real thing I said is fuck.

904
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I tried it, my daughter who's 14 also is trying to grok this whole concept of, why is this

905
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
word not good?

906
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Why is this finger not good?

907
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And there's no one who can explain the difference better than our friend, George Carlin, here

908
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:14,000
to give you the seven words you can't say on TV or radio for that matter, but in a podcast,

909
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
it's okay.

910
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I love words.

911
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I thank you for hearing my words.

912
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I want to tell you something about words that I think is important.

913
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I love, as I say, they're my work, they're my play, they're my passion.

914
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Words are all we have really.

915
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,000
We have thoughts, but thoughts are fluid, you know.

916
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And then we assign a word to a thought.

917
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And we're stuck with that word for that thought.

918
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So be careful with words.

919
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I like to think, yeah, the same words, you know, that hurt can heal.

920
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's a matter of how you pick them.

921
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
There are some people that aren't into all the words.

922
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
There are some people that would have you not use certain words.

923
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Yeah, there are 400,000 words in the...

924
00:59:52,500 --> 01:00:03,500
language and there are seven of them you can't say on television. What a ratio that is. 399,993 to 7.

925
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
They must really be bad.

926
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
They'd have to be outrageous

927
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
to be separated from a group that large.

928
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
All of you over here, you seven.

929
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Bad words.

930
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That's what they told us they were, remember? That's a bad word.

931
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
No bad words. Bad thoughts. Bad intentions. And words.

932
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You know the seven, don't you, that you can't say on television?

933
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock, sucka, motherfucker, and tits.

934
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Those are the heavy sevens.

935
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Those are the ones that'll infect your soul,

936
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,500
curve your spine,

937
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,500
and keep the country from winning the war.

938
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Shit piss fuck cunt cock fuck a motherfucker and tits, wow.

939
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,500
And tits doesn't even belong on the list, you know?

940
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Such a friendly sounding word. Sounds like a nickname, right?

941
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Hey, tits, come here!

942
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,500
Right, tits meet tuts, tuts tits, tuts tuts, man.

943
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Sounds like a snack, doesn't it, man?

944
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,500
Yes, I know, it is, right.

945
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
And I don't mean your sexist snack.

946
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
I mean new Nabisco tits!

947
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
New cheese tits

948
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,500
Corn tits and pizza tits and sesame tits onion tits

949
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Tater tits

950
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Bet you can't eat just one!

951
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,500
I usually switch off

952
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
But I mean, that word does not belong on the list.

953
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Actually, none of the words belong on the list, but you can understand why some of them are there.

954
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm not completely insensitive to people's feelings, you know, I can dig why some of those words got on the list.

955
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Like, cocksucker and motherfucker, those are...

956
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:41,500
heavyweight words. There's a lot going on there.

957
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Besides the literal translation and the emotional feeling, I mean, they're just busy words.

958
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
There's a lot of syllables to contend with.

959
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And those K's, those regressive sounds, they jump out at you, man.

960
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Cuckaboo, the fucker!

961
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
like an assault on you, you know?

962
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,500
I can dig, then.

963
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Now, we mentioned shit earlier, of course, and, uh,

964
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,500
two of the other four-letter Anglo-Saxon words are piss and cunt,

965
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
which go together, of course, but forget about it.

966
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
Little accidental humor, I further.

967
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,500
The reason the piss and cunt are on the list is that a long time ago

968
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I don't mind fucking shit, but PNC are a-

969
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
P and C are...

970
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:44,500
glad to such stupid sentences is okay you fuckers I'm going to take them now

971
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,500
Of course, the word fuck.

972
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Fuck I don't really love his some more accidental humor. I don't really want to get into that now

973
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
because I think it takes too long but I do mean that I mean I think the word fuck

974
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
is a very important word it's beginning of life and yet it's a word we use to

975
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
hurt one another quite often and people much wiser than I have said I'd rather

976
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
have my son watch a film with two people

977
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,500
people trying to kill one another and I of course can agree it's a great sentiment

978
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
I wish I know who said it first and I agree with that but

979
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I'd like to substitute the word fuck for the word kill

980
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
in all those movie cliches we grew up with, right?

981
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Okay, Sheriff, we're gonna fuck you now!

982
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But we're gonna fuck you slow!

983
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
So maybe next year I'll have a whole fucking rap on that word and I hope so.

984
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
There are two way words, those are the seven you can never say on television under any circumstances.

985
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Forget those seven, they're out.

986
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,500
But there are some two-way words, those double meaning words.

987
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500
Remember the ones you giggled at in sixth grade?

988
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,500
And the cockroach three times!

989
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,500
Say the cockroach three times!

990
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
It's in the Bible!

991
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:40,500
There are some two-way words like it's okay for Kurt Gowdy to say Roberto Canetti has two balls on him!

992
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,500
I can't say I think he heard his balls on that play, Tony.

993
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Please don't even... He must have hurt them by now.

994
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And the other two-way word that goes with that one is prick.

995
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It's okay if it goes to your finger.

996
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yes, you can prick your finger, but don't finger your prick, no, no.

997
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
The always amazing George Carlin with a classic, classic routine, the seven dirty words you

998
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
can't say, some words you can't say on television.

999
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And I think that really sums it up, you know.

1000
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
We just go on a little bit overboard with the word usage in English language at least.

1001
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And which reminds me, I really should cue up some Eddie Murphy for you next time.

1002
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
You know, I've played a couple of George Carlin bits.

1003
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Eddie Murphy would be good too.

1004
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
He's got some classic bits.

1005
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And podcasts are great for comedy because, you know, we still have the freedom to do

1006
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
what we want on them.

1007
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So if you, you know, you comedians, give us the joke of the day.

1008
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Give us the Italian pickup line of the day.

1009
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Give us anything.

1010
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
We're looking forward to it.

1011
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And that's it for the source code for today.

1012
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I tried to keep it to an hour, but George Carlin ran just a little bit long.

1013
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
We're about to...

1014
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
And I want to thank you very much for checking the show out.

1015
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Of course, the Daily Source Code is recorded live in front of a K9 studio audience from Flanders.

1016
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000

1017
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
See you tomorrow everybody, bye!
