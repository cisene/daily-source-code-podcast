1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm gonna go from Curry Castle.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So once again it's the Thorscott.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good afternoon or good evening or maybe even good morning.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
to this program. Welcome. My name is Adam Curry. It's Thursday. It is the, what is it?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
2nd of September 2004. And this is actually this is my first real source code where I've had time

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to sit down and get some audio clips together. Really write out a, well, what we call in the radio business

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
a script of what we're going to talk about today. We also call the run down it, but it works just like a

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
start at the top and you work your way down. I have it in my radio user outliner, which is I've

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
actually been using for radio production for, well, for the past year during the warning show.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So source code, where users and developers party together. We're going to do our best party really

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
hard today. I want to talk a little bit about how you, or how I put my programs together. I want to

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
talk about what we actually some vocabulary, maybe even about what we're doing here because

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
they're all kinds of

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,500
words, audio blogs, shows, morning coffee notes, evil genius chronicles. I mean, there

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
are all kinds of names floating around. I want to try and see if we can come up with

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,500
some standardized thoughts on that and what we call stuff. It's important to, you know,

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,500
if I say one word that you understand, what word I'm talking about, just as an example,

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,500
if I ask my daughter, Christina, I was 14 and if I say, what's a bookmark, the first thing

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,500
she's going to say, I guarantee you, is not going to be a strip, a thin strip that you put

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,500
in between the pages of a book. Also available at Tiffany's in Sterling Silver. No, of course,

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
not. It's going to be, well, that's something on your browser that you can remember what

22
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,500
page you were at, which of course means the same thing. But then again, it doesn't all together.

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,500
I actually want to talk about this later, but I guess we'll do it now since I've already gotten

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,500
into it. So I'm calling these things programs, which is a perfectly valid use of the word program

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
because it's, so,

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It is a content in some form that you're absorbing.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And we talk about programs in the broadcast world.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Interestingly enough, we also talk about programs in the computer world and the world of

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
internet.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We also talk about formats in the world of computers.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
RSS is a format.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Isn't that funny?

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We talk about formats in television and radio.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And a format in radio is an example as well.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We have an oldies format.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We play a 50 song at the top of the hour.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then we'll play a 70 song.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then we'll play something from the 80s.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Then we'll go back to the 60s.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And it's a format.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a formula really for how programs or if you want to call records in that case, little

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
mini programs are scheduled.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And a program, yeah, what is a program?

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It could be an application, a program that does something on your computer.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, granted, maybe this is really only the data that programs use, but it's only from

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
whatever vantage point you look at.

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,500
at it. So I think that these bits and bytes that are coming to you through electrical wires and

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,500
some of it through a thin air and then produce something on your computer is a program. It's

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,500
doing something. You start it up and it goes. Yeah, the icon is an MP3 file, but I think program works

50
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:50,500
very well. So I listened to Dave's 43-minute program, which is Morning Coffee Notes, he was driving,

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
he was up in Canada.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And it was really cool because I noticed something absolutely brilliant about what Dave is

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
doing.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He started off his show, cranking up the B-52s on his car radio.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And I know I think as a Mike just plugged directly and it was laptop and he forget the name of

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
his software, he's using what he's posted about a couple times.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And so it records very well, but when he cranks up the sound, it doesn't sound all that bad

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
if you compare it to, for instance, mixing in an MP3 into his recording feed.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This was just analog.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The microphone was basically picking up the song, but it's brilliant because there's

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
an audio program creation interface that we all know how to use the car radio.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When you want to talk over the radio, you know how to turn it down and it goes down.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You could adjust the level of the room so that you know that your voice is loud enough

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
so other people or a microphone can hear you at that moment over the music.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And also, you know how to stop and queue up a next record.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's an interface that you understand.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And really the car is a great place to...

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,500
record these types of programs. I did one yesterday, and although I didn't use all the benefits

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,500
of the car, besides the audio system, which is great, as I said, for putting in bits

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,500
as long as you have a CD player or a cassette player. But it's also, in most cases, a very

71
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,500
closed, silent environment. It's like your own little recording booth. We all have, if

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,500
we have a car, then you have your own recording booth. And in my car, I have an Audi, man,

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,500
it's really quiet on the inside. Especially, of course, if you're standing still,

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
or if you're driving this whole different story, you theoretically have a power supply

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,500
in there, or you need a DC to AC converter. And there's all kinds of benefits. And if you

76
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,500
have a hands-free phone setup, because it's so quiet in a car, usually, you could use that,

77
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,500
the microphone will be able to pick up the conversation well enough. I mean, think

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
about it. If you're in the car, and you can hear the person on the phone, then you should

79
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
be able to put your mic in the right spot.

80
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
And then just about, you know,

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If you're doing stuff on a laptop or a desktop, this computer, and you're editing, there's

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
so many different tools that you don't need to purchase a big program to use.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can use essential skills such as copy and paste to get the job done.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I use QuickTime quite a lot.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Just open up an MP3 in a QuickTime player.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
For instance, I have a song queued up here by Boston, which I want to play for you.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
All I have to do is just select that quick time window and hit the space bar and automatically

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
start playing.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It comes up really softly.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then, if I want to control the volume, I hit up the key and the arrow down.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So now I've turned it down quite a ways and I can turn it back up again.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You could do all kinds of things.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you just hold down the shift key and then hit the space bar, it's going to play

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
for a couple of seconds here.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll hit the space bar again.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was holding down the shift key that whole time.

97
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Now I'll do a control C which would be on Windows, it's Apple Key C on the Mac.

98
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,500
So I copied that little bit, now I hit control N for a new player window, I hit control V for paste,

99
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
and now it pasted in that bit that I just copied.

100
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
So I could paste that again until I'd have it twice.

101
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Okay so hopefully you get the general idea. That's just a kind of show that there's all kinds of

102
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,500
tools that we already use that are perfect for today's requirements for recording a show.

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,500
But still, anyone who's looking to develop something, there's a huge block hit for a very simple

104
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:54,500
interface with the right controls on it to do desktop program creation of audio programs at least.

105
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
All right so let me play this song of the day because I haven't thinking about it.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Because it is nice.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But uh, second day of freedom.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Here, Curry Castle.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It is indeed more than a field.

110
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm trying to think of hope, I'm having my music, forget the...

111
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And dream of a girl I used to know

112
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I caught the life in the city of New York

113
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Music

114
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh

115
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
More than a feeling on the source code.

116
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Ah, great song.

117
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Great, great, great, great, great song.

118
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,500
And more, think about it, these programs are really going to start competing with radio,

119
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,500
but only specifically with radio during drive time, which is what we call that in radio business,

120
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,500
is the morning drive time and the afternoon drive time is when people are driving.

121
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Why do you want that?

122
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Because that's when the most people have nothing better to do than listen to the radio

123
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,500
or use their cell phone, but I'm still quite confident and the numbers do prove it.

124
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,500
That if you have something interesting enough or it's listen worthy that you will beat out

125
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,500
over idle conversation.

126
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
So we are competing.

127
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Well, we're also competing with the record companies.

128
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,500
So now people can have different programs on their commute tune from work, whether they're

129
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
driving or jogging or cycling or walking whatever.

130
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
But the same goes for record companies who will learn that.

131
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And iTunes music store, I mean, we'll be computing with a whole bunch of interesting

132
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
people.

133
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And the great thing is, you know, it doesn't have to really cost more than web logging

134
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
from where I see it, except for this space and bandwidth.

135
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But that's the next step.

136
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's where BitTorrent comes in.

137
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But I don't think we're ready for that yet.

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Quick story.

139
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You may have seen on the news in the States last Tuesday.

140
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
There was a helicopter crash in Lantana, Florida, a bit of aviation news for you.

141
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And that was actually a flying buddy of mine.

142
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I just wanted to tell the story really briefly because maybe you saw it on the news.

143
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And what his experience was I talked to him earlier.

144
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He was doing his check ride for CPL, his commercial pilot license rating.

145
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And he was asked to do an auto rotation, which is basically when your engine stops,

146
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you need to land the helicopter.

147
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And luckily you can land the helicopter quite safely, quite easily.

148
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The only trick is you gotta do it right the first time.

149
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There's no second chance.

150
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're down, you're down.

151
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
if you didn't do it nicely, then it could be messy.

152
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
And if you walk away, that's a good day and a good landing.

153
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
But of course, you could land in a rooftop.

154
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
You could land all kinds of places because you don't really need much just enough air speed

155
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:56,500
at the time when it happens. So anyway, that process is called auto rotation, which means the rotor

156
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
blades are spinning and getting a certain drag due to the inertia that was already in there when they

157
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
were spinning. So, you know, there was still some spinning motion going on. And then the wind

158
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,500
literally rushing up through the blades keeps them turning. So you can slow your descent enough

159
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
so that right when you're at the very bottom, you do what we call as a flare. So you pull the stick back

160
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,500
which stops the helicopter. And then you're going to give it as much takeoff power as possible, which,

161
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,500
of course, you don't have. You're really only turning the blades to create an upward effect. And then you

162
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,500
can just settle to the ground and you can put it down lightly. So they were practicing one of those.

163
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,500
And the way you do it is...

164
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the examiner turns the throttle all the way down so the engine is idling and then you enter

165
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
auto rotation and then in this case he asks my buddy to recover at 150 feet which means at 150 feet

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you're going to turn on the you're going to roll the throttle back on, pull up the collective which

167
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
gives you a powered flight again and you continue on your way so when they rolled up the throttle at 150 feet

168
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the engine died. Now they had obviously they had enough forward speed to make it down but here's

169
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the crazy thing that I don't know why they did this but they just it's not right too. They decided

170
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
to try and restart the engine in that last 150 feet and this is a Robinson 22 and if you

171
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
have flown them you don't want to you what you want to do is you want to wait 10 seconds till you're

172
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
on the ground and then you want to see if you can restart it basically. So they landed in a cornfield

173
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and the drawback of that is that they still had a bit too much of forward speed.

174
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're on skids it's not a flat surface.

175
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,500
So the aircraft turned 90 degrees and they rolled over five times.

176
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,500
And when you land in a helicopter and roll over, it's kind of the reverse of a snowball

177
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
effect.

178
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
You know, everything comes flying off.

179
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Literally, it was left as this little capsule with the two guys seeing it and both of them

180
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
walked away from it.

181
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
So excellent landing, a very good day for them.

182
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,500
But it was, they were bruised, of course, and it happened right near the airport.

183
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
So everyone was on the scene.

184
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:11,500
But what was messy about it is he's a Dutchman and the FBI, really, man, they flew in immediately.

185
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Homeland Security was all over it because he was a foreigner who had crashed during a helicopter

186
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
course in Florida.

187
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,500
His girlfriend had to go back to, she was also there, had to go back to the Netherlands

188
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
for some college exam.

189
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,500
So she had changed the ticket at the last moment and went back three days earlier.

190
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,500
So it was really, really messy and it took them a good day and a half to get to.

191
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
it all. But he said that once everything was clear that he was all on the up and up,

192
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
there were very courteous and made sure that he felt okay about everything. And they

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
weren't total Nazis, but it definitely was pretty heavy, he said. So anyway, I'm glad that

194
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
he's very glad that he's okay and I went on the ground and was hurt. And I have my doubts

195
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
about the Robinson 22. I have to say, every single month, if you look at FAA.gov or the NTSB.gov

196
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that's even better look at their accident database, these Robinson 22s, man, there's at

197
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
least five or six a month that come out of the sky.

198
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay, continuing on and this by no means is going to be a 15 minute source code because there's

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
just too much to discuss. And you know what? It doesn't matter because isn't that exactly

200
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
what these iPod devices are for is to, if you're bored with the music I play as my song

201
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
of the day, zap through it, you know, or kill me, whatever, just cut me off.

202
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
something else. That's the beauty. When I listen to conferences from, you know, like

203
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,500
IT conversations once in a while puts up a speech from a conference. And if it is a part

204
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
that's boring, you know, something like park or just skim right through it. Beautiful.

205
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
So already, you know, you're under something good and I've blogged about this before when

206
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,500
people start to parody what you're doing in Steve Garfield, that's the name that Dave Winer

207
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,500
was looking for. Did a video parody of me doing an audio blog, which is hilarious. And I

208
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
love it because you know, that's the sincere form of flattery is when somebody manteach

209
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,500
you. But there's a couple of misconceptions about what we're doing. You know, very

210
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,500
much like when web logs just started and to this very day, this comparisons between people

211
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,500
who write on web logs and people who write and get paid for it in print publications mainly

212
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,500
or sometimes even online publications. Journalist versus bloggers, this whole debate, well,

213
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,500
that's going to be the exact same thing with these shows, with these programs because

214
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Is it radio? Is it a blog post? What are you trying to do? It's unprofessional. It sounds like

215
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
it's weird. You're recording in your car. There's a studio. It's not high quality. It

216
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
would have all these same discussions from the professional people. But the one thing that

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
what happened there sound like like...

218
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm sorry.

219
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Well, that was the battery on my wireless mic that died, and now my hard drive is spinning

220
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
along, as I'm talking on the internal speaker.

221
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
So all right, that's a bummer.

222
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
But that's exactly what I'm talking about.

223
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
It could have happened at a better time, actually.

224
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
That's perfect.

225
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
See, in a professional setup, that never would have happened, because of course you've had

226
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
three backups, and the battery would have been switched over in 0.2 milliseconds.

227
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
It wouldn't have been a problem.

228
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,500
I was going to say is you can always tell the professional audio professional, the

229
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,500
real audio professional when they put on the audio professional voice.

230
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Which sounds like this everybody.

231
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I mean, this is exactly what radio has become.

232
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,500
If you listen to anything owned by Clear Channel, literally, it's one guy sitting in one studio

233
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
with, you know, 15 stations that start local jingles.

234
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,500
So it sounds like Bob, or the lob sponge is coming to you from W-H-T-Z.

235
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,500
And I think the less we do with the big voice shit, the better.

236
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Anyway, so people are calling these blog posts, which they're not.

237
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,500
And I think the blog posts, you know, that's even worse than trying to shoehorn an old metaphor

238
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,500
into something new on the Internet.

239
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:46,500
It's like trying to shove a metaphor into an internet metaphor that's a metaphor of something in the old analog world.

240
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
don't need to do that. We're just using, I think what we're doing here is just using web

241
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
logs, the infrastructure to distribute this stuff. It's RSS 2.0, it's the archive or web

242
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
log. That's the kind of stuff that's important. You can go find old shows and we've already

243
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
solved all of that. We don't have to create new stuff. So this is, I think, totally a bootstrap.

244
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Just hook everything on top and it should ride. We're going to make it shine up a bit on

245
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the outside so that users, no interest in development. Don't see it. Just get the benefit

246
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
of it. There was a clip that was floating out there, which was the manifesto against

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
audio blogs. If you haven't heard it, it's all over the place. But what I found was the

248
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
mashup version of that, which is basically a remix of the manifesto, which talks about how

249
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
stupid the idea is of audio blogging because you can't link to anything.

250
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,500
and every URL in this clip is spoken out.

251
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
You can check this out at WhttpColumn forward slash forward slash.

252
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Obviously, you can't link from my voice to another site, a weblogger URL.

253
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
But I don't want you to sit here and listen to me.

254
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
I don't want you reading anything.

255
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Here's a little clip of the blogger mashup of the manifesto

256
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,500
and I'll see if I have another battery laying around while you guys listen to this.

257
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Listen to me and pass the volume.

258
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
The end of power is scanned.

259
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They can't skip a boy.

260
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They can't skip a boy.

261
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They can't skip a boy.

262
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They can't skip a boy.

263
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They can't skip a boy.

264
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
They can't skip a boy.

265
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
They can't skip a boy.

266
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They can't skip a boy.

267
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They can't skip a boy.

268
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They can't skip a boy.

269
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They can't skip a boy.

270
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
They can't skip a boy.

271
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They can't skip a boy.

272
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They can't skip a boy.

273
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They can't skip a boy.

274
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
They can't skip a boy.

275
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They can't skip a boy.

276
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They can't skip a boy.

277
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
They can't skip a boy.

278
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They can't skip a boy.

279
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They can't skip a boy.

280
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
They can't skip a boy.

281
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They can't skip a boy.

282
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They can't skip a boy.

283
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
For the first time in human history, you can have anything you write read by millions of

284
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
people, whether within days or within hours.

285
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And all it takes to sound, imagination, and the discipline to put it something worth

286
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
waiting.

287
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There are no obstacles anymore.

288
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So why must we create new ones?

289
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Just because you're going to be able to do a real time, three-dimensional, high-definition,

290
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
interactive virtual reality, fly through with the inside of your cat.

291
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Does that mean you should?

292
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Does that mean it belongs on your website?

293
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This is not the legacy that we want to leave.

294
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The stops are ridiculous self-indulgence.

295
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And shut up and write.

296
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And if you want to copy this without having to listen to all of it, then bye.

297
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
My God you confine me.

Audio hype and manifesto.txt

301
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Well great everybody good song and I...

302
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Hello?

303
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Hello, oh crap.

304
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Okay, so there you have it.

305
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,500
In 50 years of television, we're still having the same argument.

306
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Writing is better.

307
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
No, everything has its place.

308
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Everything has its place.

309
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Okay, moving right along.

310
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I've spoken a couple times about Dave Weiner.

311
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,500
He did an excellent morning coffee notes from his car.

312
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
I encourage you to check it out.

313
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
You can listen to it at scripting.com.

314
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,500
And he apparently hadn't heard a couple of episodes of source code and loaded up on him for his drive.

315
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,500
And he's been driving for hours every single day across country.

316
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
And I was up in Canada as I said.

317
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,500
So he had like a total overdose of Adam Curry.

318
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,500
It must have been an hour and a half worth at least of crap.

319
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
But he said he loved it.

320
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,500
And he actually inspired me to talk about this, you know, the pro guys versus what we're doing in our programs.

321
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
And he says he loves all the, you know, the knowledge.

322
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
on secroteurs, all the crap that happens when shit doesn't work and my wife walks in

323
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and that makes total sense is exactly what we love about web logs and the beginning and

324
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
what we're still love about.

325
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's raw, you know, it's, yeah, you can make it as slick and professional as you want, but

326
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
be yourself and if you can find the right tools to capture that, then I think it's great.

327
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We've had a private conversation about, and of course he is right partially about the concept of the iPod

328
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
platform.

329
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I think everyone understands when I talk about the iPod platform.

330
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's like, okay, here's this thing that millions of them out there and all we're doing is we're storing our

331
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
shit on them and we're buying shit from the man, especially for Dave Slusher, to put on it, you know,

332
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
or we're ripping the man off or whatever.

333
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's not quite working yet.

334
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And there's so much more can be done with it because, you know, we're connecting to our computer

335
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
but we're not really connecting them to anything except to a program that lets you update stuff on it.

336
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,500
So let's move that perception over to this iPod can do so much more.

337
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
I can subscribe to stuff.

338
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,500
The problem, of course, is that iPod is a trademark of Apple computers.

339
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
And there are so many other devices out there.

340
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Granted, HP is now selling their version of an iPod.

341
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,500
But there's tons of other stuff.

342
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,500
And I'm going to get back to that just a little bit later when I talk some technology stuff

343
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,500
about, well, something new that can be developed.

344
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,500
And I think should be developed to get away from where we are right now, which is basically

345
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,500
updating iTunes, which automatically talks to iPod.

346
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
But of course we do have it now on Linux, on Mac, and a Windows.

347
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,500
So we're off to a good start here, definitely, just messing around.

348
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
I think this is amazing.

349
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,500
But of course, the question is, do we need a new name or do we not care about it?

350
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,500
And personally, I think there's a lot of value to be had from, you know, no one's trying to

351
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
commercialize the name iPod.

352
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
platform, but we could probably write on the co-tails of Apple's marketing and go quite

353
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
a ways with that.

354
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And there's danger in that as well, but it's just like iPodder.

355
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I called my script iPodder that downloads everything onto your iPod automatically.

356
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And I actually went back, because I remember Dave Winer wrote about it, the five steps to

357
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
picking a name for your company.

358
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And I went through all the steps and iPodder was exactly the right name, but of course,

359
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I broke on the URL.

360
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The domain name is not available in any conceivable form that I'd like.

361
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So of course that name is also, I guess, worthless unless I can capture the domain name.

362
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But again, I'm not interested in commercializing this nor do I think there's any value to it

363
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
in what it does by itself.

364
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Every computer manufacturer, every iPod device like MP3 manufacturing, other fuckers

365
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,000
should...

366
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,500
and you know, bundle this with it and just make it all work so that we can get on with

367
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,500
making programs for it. That's what the excitement is for me at least. You know, I just don't

368
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,500
see we can make any money on that and I'm not looking for that quite frankly.

369
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:40,500
One thing I have done, and Dave's suggestion is I definitely needed for the source code

370
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:48,500
to have a better way to point people to it because, and that's where part of that manifesto

371
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,500
is true is, you know, well, where do I find the archive for source code? You know, I've

372
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:01,500
gotten this from a friend where can I find the RSS link? So I was lucky enough to register

373
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,500
dailysourcecode.com and I think that's probably propagated by now. So if you go to the browser,

374
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,500
you get the archives of all the different programs and of course you can subscribe to the RSS

375
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,500
feed there with enclosures and I'll obviously I'm going to put a link there to iPodder as

376
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
well. Okay.

377
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So I see a format for these programs emerging, which is interesting.

378
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And maybe I'm just noticing it because I'm used to listening to radio and picking up the way a format is put together.

379
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But we actually have a format that I see, which is a tune at the beginning or some music at the beginning and often at the end sometimes music underneath.

380
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But we are seeing some mixed up stuff there.

381
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Also time stamping at the beginning.

382
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This is my program for this is the date that I'm recording this.

383
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I thought for a second everyone kind of agreed that 15 minutes is right.

384
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But I was just again, I was thinking about that.

385
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No, of course not right.

386
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If your commute is 40 minutes and I'm cutting 50 minutes, you know, you'll either sit in the parking lot for 10 like you do with radio or you'll wear it up the steps or you'll pause it.

387
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And you'll continue on your lunch break, or you'll never listen to it again.

388
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
In that case, hopefully you're going to tell me so that I can.

389
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,500
keep score of what the listeners want. If it's just way too long, please let me know.

390
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I think, of course, less is more. I have to agree. But at a certain point, you're just boring.

391
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,500
And if you don't know, if you're talking to yourself and you're not boring yourself,

392
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
then it's either really interesting or you need to be checked.

393
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:53,500
I picked up a program from RasterWeb. Is that what I want to say? Was that Raster?

394
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Oh, shoot. I think I didn't queue that up properly. Well, we're going to do this

395
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:07,500
queuing together then. So we'll find the right spot. He has an objection to the format that I use

396
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,500
in the Dave Slusher uses or a part of the format that we use. Let me just search along with you.

397
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I'm using QuickTime here. So I'll speed through it and queue up to the bit that I want you to hear.

398
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
To stay home. We are.

399
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Drop it for the next. Yeah, we work.

400
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's about it.

401
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, one thing I didn't want to mention is that it's a bad idea.

402
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm going to try to keep it clean.

403
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You know, I try not to work blue.

404
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I've noticed that at the curry and Dave Slesher, they are ill-naughty.

405
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Say some of the naughty words and you know what words I'm talking about there.

406
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Start with taxes and apps and sometimes A's.

407
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
There might be some other ones, but you know, I don't even want to get into that.

408
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You know, this is a family broadcast here.

409
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Keep it clean.

410
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Keep it me.

411
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Okay. So obviously, totally your choice.

412
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But I can tell you right now if you ever listen to a source code,

413
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
it's me and it's raw as what you get and there's all kinds of profanity in there.

414
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And it may not just be words. It could just even be the thoughts.

415
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So another format that I stumbled across.

416
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This one came through the blog bigger media feed which I'm not quite sure what.

417
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
into that because they just pick up stuff from out there apparently and perhaps the stuff

418
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
well. It would make sense that it's coming through a spidering or indexing of some sort

419
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and they provide an RSS feed which is updated continuously and it's just weird, you know

420
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
it's sometimes once in a while the source code comes back on it but there's all kinds of

421
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
wacky stuff and some of the I guess we call audio blog posts are actually coming through.

422
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
These are horrible because they'll come through like with a title that is audio one sound quality

423
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
horrendous usually because it's recorded through a telephone and no tags or metadata whatsoever.

424
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So I just didn't possible mean to trace where it came from which is really too bad for some people

425
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
in this case perhaps exceptionally so because here's another format that can be this iPod platform

426
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
can be used for with RSS think about personal ads.

427
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Big life, boss.

428
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Big life, boss.

429
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Big life, boss.

430
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
I'm very, very, very happy.

431
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Okay, so what I'd rather do is point you to that clip, but I have nowhere to point you

432
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
to.

433
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,500
So that's another thing we have to continue to look at.

434
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:56,500
And there are many freeware, shareware, open source programs that you can use to add metadata

435
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
to your program.

436
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
And if you don't know what metadata is, and I think it's a horrible name, by the way,

437
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,500
it's basically just all the catalog stuff that you want so that, you know, hold on a second,

438
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
that's my phone.

439
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Where is it?

440
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Where's that?

441
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,500
I'll call it back later.

442
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
It's the guy from the air show.

443
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I'm going to the air show on Saturday and Lely Stutt, mid-Northen part of Holland in the

444
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Polterlands, and I'll be sure to take some pictures and post them.

445
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
He's calling about my slot time for landing.

446
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Where was I?

447
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Right.

448
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
So.

449
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So metadata is basically just a little program and you fire it up this application and

450
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
you select your file, your MP3 file, and then you can add the name, the artist, the composer.

451
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Of course it's total crap because it's all geared for music where I want it.

452
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So that's differently.

453
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And you choose a category.

454
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's important by the way.

455
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You want to choose speech so that it gets categorized properly in people's playlists and library

456
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
systems.

457
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But composer, what kind of crap is that?

458
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So I always put my email address in there and my website at my web blog address.

459
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Just a question I wanted to throw out there that you could respond to.

460
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
My hard drive is starting to get full.

461
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I've got about three gigs left and I've been playing around with stuff continuously for

462
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
the past two weeks.

463
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You know the drill.

464
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Deleting this and that, find anything larger than 10 megs.

465
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What is it?

466
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Kill your darling's time.

467
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That's a message.

468
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Kill your darling's time is what it is.

469
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And I don't want to do that.

470
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And clearly what's happened is my.

471
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,500
iTunes library and my iFoto library have filled up my hard drive now.

472
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I like having.

473
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Stuff available pictures is not not too bad you know i don't mind archiving that off which archive it to DVDs is that the best firewire drive word about firewire drive ever since my last story.

474
00:36:52,500 --> 00:37:02,500
And is it is it does i photo allow for an export that you might say i want to see that picture real quick or should i throw a server somewhere i'm just at a loss.

475
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:09,500
What to do now you know i just need more space on my laptop i just need more space i don't want to lug around an extra drive if i.

476
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Either need to write something really big a big file or if i want to find that particular.

477
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:22,500
A photo now the iTunes actually is interesting i think it's just going to take me an afternoon and some thought but.

478
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I believe that i can make it so with some shareware and open source programs that are out there that i'll basically use my ipod as my music and digital audio library and i think.

479
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and just clean out the entire disk on my hard drive of anything else.

480
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's got to be 16 to 17 gigs so that if I want to hear something on my laptop,

481
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
you know, I can just fire it up and either it'll stream it in from the iPod

482
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
or it'll do a quick copy or something like that.

483
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You know, I'll figure something out.

484
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But if you have any ideas or how, you know, let me know how you do it.

485
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And how we can make that easier for us because, you know, I'm running this problem.

486
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Other people are going to run into this problem.

487
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So again, here's where.

488
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Users and developers get to party together.

489
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Just got a link from my buddy Michiel Fainstra that the Dutch Telegraph,

490
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the online edition iPodder and link to iPodder from Mac and iPodder for Windows.

491
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And it's calling this a very interesting thing, which is cool because the Telegraph is,

492
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
what is that comparable with?

493
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's the largest newspaper by far.

494
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It has well over a million daily subscribers for our country.

495
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That's a lot.

496
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,500
But I think like USA today kind of same type of bubble gum content.

497
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Moving right along and I'm almost done.

498
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,500
There's a couple more things I want to let you hear and want to talk about.

499
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,500
David slusher released getting closures version 2.0.

500
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Now I still have right after them done with this I'm going to sit down and read through his giga

501
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,500
ginormous email and get acquainted with him and talk to him on a really on a one to one

502
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,500
level about what we're doing since we haven't officially met.

503
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
I just haven't replied yet.

504
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
It's really what I'm saying.

505
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,500
But he released a version 2.0 of his get enclosures and all kinds of great stuff in there with

506
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:23,500
the caching and it now does a AC AC AC files apples format which I see conversations is using

507
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,500
so you can bookmark something on your iPod and it'll you can go back to it later if you

508
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
decided to go watch listen to something else.

509
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,500
So all kinds of good stuff only it's got a major bug in it.

510
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And I'm basically receiving 20 copies of stuff

511
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and my iTunes playlists are being repopulated

512
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and there's all kinds of duplicates everywhere.

513
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So I think we're stuck in some kind of loop day

514
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and I'm gonna help you work through it.

515
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I had this problem myself when I was doing

516
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the iPodder script and quite frankly,

517
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
it may be the Apple script that my Apple script

518
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you're using that's hosting.

519
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So let's dig into that together so we can fix it

520
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
because I love your script.

521
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't use the iPodder myself.

522
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I love your script and want to help you develop it even further.

523
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Okay, and then an email from Andrew Davy

524
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and he says that he's been listening

525
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
to the source code from Broadcast One.

526
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
He's a student freelance coder.

527
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
He says great to listen to show the bridges

528
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the gap between users and developers.

529
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
tremendous complement. Now I said, I'm going to quote him here, I know that iPod and iTunes go hand in hand.

530
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You've mentioned before about needing solutions for other portable audio devices on other platforms, Windows, etc.

531
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, Windows Media Player 9 supports a large number of portable devices and is programmable,

532
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
either via external applications using COM objects and also internally via plugins.

533
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So in theory, someone can write a script to download and close as an add them to the Windows Media Player 9 Media Library.

534
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Furthermore, a plugin could then automatically upload a new device, a new audio to any attached device.

535
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So we clearly need to look into this. Windows Media Player 9 hackers.

536
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If you understand what COM objects are, I'm sure it's just a way to talk to the player

537
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,000
through something that Windows owns or we can write a plugin, think about that a plugin.

538
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
That would be great for... and maybe that's the way to go.

539
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I wonder what Winamp has. Winamp, I know, supports plugins. That may be the perfect place to do it. Damn. All right. So thank you, Andrew Davy for that excellent, excellent idea.

540
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Okay. I'm going to wind up with a clip here that I caught off of Memory Lane. That's the talk interview show that Halley suit does for IT Conversations.com.

541
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:25,500
And she was interviewing David Weinberger, who almost recently he's known for his work on the Dean campaign. And he was talking about the Dean campaign and his experience. And I picked up this one piece that I wanted to share with you because it really sums up the current political process were in and the way it's been for centuries probably.

542
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:32,500
But just listen what he has to say because he was there close up with the Dean campaign. So here the thing that to me was thrilling about the Dean camp.

543
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and I project an assume it was others as well.

544
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Other Diniacs was that here we had a chance to take the campaign back

545
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
from these lying hypocritical, chemical,

546
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
political managers who have taken over our country.

547
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Right, who are marketing democracy.

548
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Not marketing democracy.

549
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The language of politics now is language of marketing.

550
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
All right, you listen to them speak about the campaigns

551
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and how they're going to win

552
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and it is exactly the language of marketing.

553
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's demographic breakdowns,

554
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
it's having messages and delivering messages through a number of...

555
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Exactly, they have learned politics from the marketers

556
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and it seems to work.

557
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But the price of that is you get your person 50% plus one.

558
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But the result of it is that you have these horrendous campaigns

559
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
like the one that's currently going on between Kerry and Bush.

560
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That is, it's marketing without the restraints.

561
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
As bad as it can...

562
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Well, there you go.

563
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,500
So while that clip was playing, the battery on my transmitter died and I don't have another

564
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,500
spare.

565
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
But that's okay because we're at the end of the show for today and I hope I got across

566
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
what I was trying to get across.

567
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,500
If you want to respond, I want to comment on anything please just drop me an email, adam

568
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,500
at curry.com, curri.com, or check out my website live.curry.com.

569
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
And I will be back tomorrow.

570
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Let's meet users and developers for the source.

571
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Music

572
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm sorry.
