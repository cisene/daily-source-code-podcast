1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Koji is folks wide. It's so time.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That is curry.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The power of the door.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How did everybody welcome to the Daily Source code?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's Wednesday.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
November 24th, 2004.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage in the United Kingdom.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is the Daily Source code.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's hard to say that.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good evening.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've got a grit, you know.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Someone called me the It's all going to podcast me out of the day.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I guess it's fair for me to say.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We've got a really great shoe for everybody.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's all going to ever say it ever.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I wonder if it's the ever.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh man.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Still no bandwidth to speak of.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Looks like that's going to be another seven days from this moment on.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Although my phone line now has officially been verified.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So we're no longer on the professional thing.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're official, which means.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Eventually we're going to get build for having a

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A diet of connection open for 23 hours of the day.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now we're on the door.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We've got a couple of things lined up for you today,

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which I think are kind of cool.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We've got some non-RIA music for you.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which actually comes from the cottage itself.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So talk about that later on.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Got a couple of comments.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come on, the net.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, and tonight.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
At least it's tonight here.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's 1026 p.m.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We're going to get Patricia in here to talk about.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, another one of Patricia's hippie stories.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Actually, I don't think it's a hippie story.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Actually, we were even married.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think when this particular instance occurred.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Which should be talking about on today's source code.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Something that I've teased before.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It is a her story about Stevie Nix.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, I'm going to break the rules for just a second here,

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
while we get into the mood.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A lot of little bit of feet would make.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you learn so bad?

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You need someone's help.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To lead me through the night.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I need someone's arms.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So let's squeeze midnight.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't want the night begins.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm out of hand.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because I need.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your love so bad.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I need some lips.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
To feel next to mine.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I need someone to stand up.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tell me what I have.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I wear the lights alone.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it's time to go.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's what I need.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I love so bad.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So why don't you get it up.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And bring it all to me.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All right, and on a piece of paper baby.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So we can't be left to me.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There will be that you love me.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And bring it all to me.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And stop by the blue fire.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I need someone's help.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To feel next to mine.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I need someone's help.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
To feel next to mine.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I need someone's help.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To feel next to mine.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I need someone's help.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
To feel next to me.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And bring it all to me.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I need someone's help.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
To feel next to mine.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because I need someone's help.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To feel next to mine.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
To feel next to mine.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:39,720
Yeah, that's a bummer.

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,680
I thought there's going to be the full version.

96
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,480
It's like the single version, three minutes, forty-six seconds.

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Damn.

98
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Did you love so bad?

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,040
Fleetwood Mac on your daily source code for Wednesday, November 24th, 2004.

100
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,520
Oh man, so much stuff happening today.

101
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
There were some actually a friend of ours, was in the neighborhood you called up

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
today.

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm visiting someone else in the neighborhood, had some tea with them, Patricia and I went

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
out.

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh man.

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
What do we do?

107
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:24,000
We got all kinds of trash, waste baskets, dog food bowls, we had some grocery shopping

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,600
and I'm still totally tripping from the flueberg, although it's much better, I had a sweaty

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:38,880
ass night, literally a sweaty ass night, not good and Patricia just put a clean sheets on

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
the bed too.

111
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay, so let me get Patricia, I'm going to turn on the roving mic here, I'll know

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
what to say.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
On?

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,600
It's a big advantage of smaller dwellings, there's even here each other when you call

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
on.

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Huh?

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,040
Are you there?

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,440
Showtime baby.

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,240
Come on, we're on the air.

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah, come on up.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,320
I have a mic just for you, it's like really professional.

122
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:20,160
We should take a picture of this right now, that's horrible.

123
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,440
Yes, of course, he is sitting chair, this is like the guest chair, so it's like the

124
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
tonight's show.

125
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Can I just put the microphone on you?

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Yep.

127
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Who do I say tonight?

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,920
Show.

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Let's make sure I can hear you.

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Hello?

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Hello.

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,480
Okay, let me turn you up just a little bit there, let's say.

133
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:50,320
Okay, so I actually just played the flueberg mic, you do your love so bad.

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:58,760
First of all, what do you think about the United Kingdom, but living here?

135
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, so far, I think if I compare it to Holland, I think a lot of Americans think

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that Dutch people are so nice, don't you think so and so friendly and we always look like

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
yeah?

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Well, that's because they're confused with Scandinavians.

139
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
I think so.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Yeah, or German.

141
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,040
Well, actually, it's the higher up you go the nicer they get when I think they say.

142
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,280
Yeah, Swedes are really nice, and we're dealing with you talking.

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Well, it's Dutch.

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Oh, he said Dutch now.

145
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
No, it's Dutch.

146
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Oh, Holland days.

147
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Oh, yeah.

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
That's probably confused.

149
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,280
It's the Holland days sauce from Holland?

150
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Is it?

152
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,280
But it's so far because we haven't been out a lot.

153
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
No, no.

154
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
No, because we're unpacking.

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Yeah, we've been out.

156
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Between boxes and boxes, we dream of boxes and everybody who moved knows that it's a pain

157
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
in the air.

158
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Yeah.

159
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Well, especially international moves.

160
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
It's time you're unaware.

161
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
You don't know which box it is.

162
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Yeah.

163
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,280
You can't read the things as on it, you know, written by the movers.

164
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,280
See, people just don't understand how horrible that is, particularly for you.

165
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Yeah.

166
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Well, particularly, I think for you.

167
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Yeah, but that's your, you're, you're, you're working very, very organized.

168
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Yeah.

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm organized.

170
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
I am a perfectionist.

171
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I have to say.

172
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,280
And you look lovely in that outfit.

173
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Thank you.

174
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:36,280
And so it's so hard to sit between all those boxes and, and, can't, it's just not, it doesn't look good.

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
I, on the other hand, feel right at home.

176
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,280
And we have to say, and they know that we're coming from a castle.

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Yeah.

178
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
And we try to put the castle in the house.

179
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
In the house.

180
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Very difficult.

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
That's hard.

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
You know, you can do that.

183
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
To say the least.

184
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,280
So what we're going to do is sort of a charity.

185
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
We're going to look it up in the yellow pages.

186
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Yeah.

187
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,280
And see if we can, you know, we have to give things away.

188
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Yeah.

189
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Because I was just talking to a friend.

190
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I said, isn't it strange that if you go, say, on vacation or you go in for a weekend, you take one bag.

191
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
You have your, you know, your stuff in there.

192
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Your t-shirts and your jeans and, and sort of, and a toilet bag.

193
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
And that's it.

194
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,280
And again, and all those days, you never miss anything.

195
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
No, you know, well, maybe some clothes, but other stuff.

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
No, but she don't miss anything.

197
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
No.

198
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
And look, you know, you're schlepping all this stuff with you.

199
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
And find nothing.

200
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah.

201
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Why?

202
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
You know, we, we are ants.

203
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Yeah.

204
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Yep.

205
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Yeah.

206
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Money can buy me love.

207
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Exactly.

208
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Okay.

209
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
That too.

210
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,280
We brought you here tonight on the daily source code.

211
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,280
And the last time we spoke, we had a hippie story.

212
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
The early seven days David Bowie.

213
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,280
And man, thank you again for letting the world know that I am, um, better endowed than,

214
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
than David Bowie.

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Let me tell you that that has been an incredible go boost.

216
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Yes.

217
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
It's very important for me.

218
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,280
And I know there are lots of guys out there who understand exactly what I'm talking about.

219
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Yeah.

220
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,280
And tonight, we have another story from Patricia's archives.

221
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Uh, and this is a nice one.

222
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Which one too?

223
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
This is, well, thank you.

224
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
We have many more, right?

225
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Yeah.

226
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
We have plenty.

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Right.

228
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
So when I run out of shit to say on this show, then I could just bring you in.

229
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Uh, Stevie Nix was, uh, a store.

230
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
It's a short one.

231
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Oh.

232
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Okay.

233
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
A shorty but goody.

234
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Uh, yeah.

235
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Okay.

236
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
It's very short action.

237
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,280
It's, it's, it's not, not really, uh, something, uh, really important.

238
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Am I better endowed than Stevie Nix?

239
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Oh, that's, yeah.

240
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Well, no.

241
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,280
So you have to, this is also about, about size.

242
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Um, I, how long has to go?

243
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
We were in LA.

244
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Mm-hmm.

245
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
And you had to tape a show for MTV.

246
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Mm-hmm.

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Remember that?

248
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
We were not married yet.

249
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Oh, we weren't.

250
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Also, this was 1987, 88.

251
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
I think it was in the beginning.

252
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, yes.

253
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
We just moved to, uh, to New York.

254
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Okay.

255
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
So that was 87.

256
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Yeah.

257
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,280
And you had to go out to LA and you took me with you.

258
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Because it was better weather there.

259
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
So it was very nice.

260
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:27,280
And we went out to a lovely restaurant that was one of the famous hot spots that we needed to see.

261
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Which one was that?

262
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
The dome?

263
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
The dome.

264
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Right.

265
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Oh, it wasn't Lionel Richie there that night as well.

266
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Yeah.

267
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I was so proud of this.

268
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,280
They always said, like, you have to go there because lots, lots and lots.

269
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah.

270
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I don't think it's like that anymore.

271
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
I think it's completely, it may not even be there anymore.

272
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Right.

273
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,280
But in these days, you know, it was that day with the sheep.

274
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
She hot spot.

275
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Right.

276
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
And there we were.

277
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
So we were there.

278
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
We were in the restaurant.

279
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
And who do we with?

280
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Do you remember?

281
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Was it just MTV people Charlie Midnight?

282
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Maybe.

283
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
No, no, no, no, no.

284
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I wasn't Charlie Midnight.

285
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
I think it was only.

286
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Scott Shannon, maybe.

287
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Dana Miller.

288
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Now, I probably Scott Shannon.

289
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
I don't know.

290
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Scott Shannon, everybody.

291
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
If I would have.

292
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Back and see you.

293
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Well, maybe it was only the two of us because I told you right away.

294
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,280
You mean just the two of us.

295
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Just the two of us.

296
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Now, so we said there.

297
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
And while you ordered, I said have to go to the bathroom quickly.

298
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Ladies, really.

299
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,280
So I have to go to the ladies room.

300
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,280
And while I'm in the ladies room, there were, I think, three doors.

301
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
And there were all locked.

302
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,280
One of the doors went open.

303
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
And out came Stephen X.

304
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Okay, let me just reset this.

305
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
So you walk into the ladies room.

306
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
There's three stalls.

307
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
All three are busy.

308
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
This is it.

309
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Up here.

310
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Did you look underneath to see the fee?

311
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
No, no, no, no.

312
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
I don't think the doors like that.

313
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
No, we don't do that.

314
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Oh, guys do that.

315
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
No, no, no, no.

316
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Who the hell?

317
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
No, but when you walk in, you want to make sure there's no one in there.

318
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
So you look underneath.

319
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
No, no, no, no.

320
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
They were closed.

321
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
So Stephen X.

322
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Stephen X.

323
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm like, oh, Stephen X.

324
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
I'm just going to do like.

325
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
What was she wearing?

326
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
No, I don't remember.

327
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
It's something black.

328
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I remember that.

329
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Okay.

330
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Was it like her flowing clothes?

331
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Of course.

332
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Of course.

333
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
And so she came out of there.

334
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
The door went out.

335
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Oh, oh, oh.

336
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Oh, she taller than you.

337
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
She taller than you.

338
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
No, she's tiny.

339
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
She's not that big.

340
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Really?

341
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Well, I can't remember.

342
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
She's not not a very tall name.

343
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Really?

344
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
I thought you were.

345
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
No.

346
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Okay.

347
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
So she came out.

348
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,280
And actually behind her came sort of a roofed.

349
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,280
So the way terrible smell.

350
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,280
She was like, yeah, she was coming out of the straw.

351
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
I was coming out of the straw.

352
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
That's the way she came out.

353
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,280
But I had no choice because the other door was.

354
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Stinky Nicks.

355
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Stinky Nicks.

356
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
So.

357
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Why are you going?

358
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,280
I had to, you know, go into that door.

359
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
You know, in that bathroom.

360
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Because the other one, the other one,

361
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
They'll do.

362
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
And who was the other one?

363
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Like Oprah.

364
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,760
I don't know if I'm a waltz or something.

365
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,760
So I went into that one and the seat was still hot.

366
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,240
I don't know if I felt very warm.

367
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,840
But we have to say, before I sat down,

368
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,680
I thought you were a...

369
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,680
I saw that it hadn't, she flushed, but it was still there.

370
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,760
So that was a big...

371
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,160
It was a hair.

372
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,360
It was a hair.

373
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,920
Turling, probably too heavy

374
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
to flunk.

375
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:48,440
And then I said, I'm like, Jesus, you know, you're flushed in these turds.

376
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,720
Yeah, right.

377
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Yeah.

378
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,040
So every time I see her, I have to think, too.

379
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Turd.

380
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Excellent.

381
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Hold on a second.

382
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
That was excellent.

383
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Thank you.

384
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,640
That was an excellent story.

385
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Aren't you proud of yourself?

386
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Well, you know.

387
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,440
OK, we have some other exciting news that happened today.

388
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,720
Today, we bought the masters of Mamboitulliano, the song that you recorded.

389
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,600
Just two months ago, three months ago.

390
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,960
So I was thinking, first time I'm going to play it on the show.

391
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,960
I was thinking, why don't we make it available for anyone to play on a podcast?

392
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Yeah.

393
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
It's a good idea.

394
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,400
So it's a big band.

395
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
It's one of the different bands.

396
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
Yeah, it's up to tell me about the song.

397
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,040
Tell me about how you got it all set up and...

398
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,480
Well, actually, it is from Mamboitulliano's thing.

399
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
That was Dutch.

400
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,080
What do you want to say?

402
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,040
It's so clear.

403
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,680
Rose made a clue.

404
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Rose made a clue.

405
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,520
Yeah, it's late.

406
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,080
Yeah, I also have Frank Sinatra did it, too.

407
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't think, I don't know.

408
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
No, Dean Martin.

409
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,440
I have Frank Sinatra.

410
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
No, Dean Martin.

411
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
I have Frank Sinatra.

412
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,680
It's a very famous song.

413
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah.

414
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
And it's...

415
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,480
I think I have that.

416
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,440
I think a 50's song.

417
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,480
It's always a great.

418
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,720
It's a wonderful, wonderful song.

419
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
It's a...

420
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,680
It's a Mambo, which is, of course, more Spanish.

421
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,560
But it's an Italian Mambo.

422
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
It's Italian Mambo.

423
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,040
It's an Italian Mambo, yeah.

424
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,240
Okay.

425
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,720
And it's called Mambo.

426
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Well, that...

427
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,600
First of all, this isn't just like some little thing you did here.

428
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,440
You had like everything that all the instruments are real.

429
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Played by the music.

430
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Yeah, it's not like...

431
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
It's not like...

432
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
It was in real time.

433
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
You guys are overdubs.

434
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,800
I thought you recorded that whole thing.

435
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,960
I thought you recorded that whole thing.

436
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

437
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Life.

438
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I sang it live with it.

439
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Yeah.

440
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,360
And afterwards, I did some backing vocals with Ivan, my sister.

441
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Right.

442
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,080
But I sang it right away with the band.

443
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,520
Like, Frank Sinatra used to do first studio.

444
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,760
That was the band.

445
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,920
That was me.

446
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,760
And...

447
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
You did some pickups here.

448
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,080
You must have done some pickups.

449
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Just some insert.

450
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
No, no.

451
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
I don't know.

452
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
No, I don't need some.

453
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
I don't know.

454
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
That's right, baby.

455
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
That's right.

456
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
And you're a turd's flush.

457
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
All right.

458
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
See you.

459
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
All right.

460
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,560
So we'll be sure to put this up for download.

461
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560

462
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560

Mambo, if you don't know.

579
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,120
We're gonna go here on the daily source code.

580
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,880
You know, you should do something with your voice, huh?

581
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,840
Oh, I don't know that.

582
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
That's awesome.

583
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,880
Oh, my mic.

584
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
It's okay, here's another one.

585
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,120
So we'll at least that under the Creative Commons license,

586
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,120
which means anyone can use it non-commercialy.

587
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,360
We'll choose for that one, not no.

588
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,920
Oh, we're gonna have a DVD out soon.

589
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,760
You know what I'm just saying?

590
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,320
Anyone can use this song in their podcast

591
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,480
that can use it non-commercial as long as they create it.

592
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,800
It's ours, so we can do whatever you want to do.

593
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Isn't that fun?

594
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Isn't that fun?

595
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Yeah, I love that.

596
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
That's cool.

597
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
No.

598
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
No.

599
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
We cannot do that.

600
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
That's cool.

601
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
No.

602
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
That's cool, baby.

603
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Anything else?

604
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
No.

605
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
No.

606
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Okay.

607
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
It's nice here in your studio.

608
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Yeah, it's nice.

609
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
It's very nice.

610
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Why don't you take off your dress?

611
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh.

612
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Okay.

613
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Oops.

614
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I'm gonna have a nice cup of tea.

615
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Yes.

616
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Okay.

617
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
All right, see?

618
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
You take off.

619
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,440
Let's speak something English here.

620
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Oh, but...

621
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Crazy American.

622
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Yeah.

623
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Yeah.

624
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah.

625
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
I have to learn some English here.

626
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Well, sweetie, darling.

627
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Go downstairs.

628
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Okay, yeah.

629
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,000
Could you make me a cup or two?

630
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
A cup or two?

631
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
A cup or two?

632
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
A cup or two?

633
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
A cup or two?

634
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
All right.

635
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,480
All right, then.

636
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,680
Patricia Pi, everybody.

637
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Alrighty.

638
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,320
Source code continues.

639
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Let's see.

640
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
More comedy.

641
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,000
Hello, and welcome to Adam Curry's One Minute Moving Tip.

642
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,360
Things you need to know when you're moving.

643
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,560
First of all, put all of your worldly belongings into cardboard boxes.

644
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,360
Now be sure to tape them up a nice and tight and the way all the way.

645
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
What was that?

646
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Look at the...

647
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,760
Well, it looks like that box needs just a little bit more tailor.

648
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Hmm.

649
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,280
More you're gonna have problems getting that through customs.

650
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,400
Just a little something for you, Adam, to help you get through through this crazy move

651
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
to the UK.

652
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Good luck.

653
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Boy on.

654
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,520
When you walked in the door and you changed your shoes, you switched to a sweater

655
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,120
and said, how do you do neighbor?

656
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,720
How do you do?

657
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,440
I remember the look in your sparkle eyes that said clearly.

658
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I love you.

659
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,160
Don't do the nice neighbor.

660
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,440
You saw me looking at you.

661
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,440
I'll picture picture up on the wall of the old street standing tall and I'll

662
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,840
maybe go round, spin it away, Charlie.

663
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,560
Oh, Charlie.

664
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,400
Where did you go today?

665
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,200
Well, we played with Santa Wemper walks in the park, you were a gentleman.

666
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,640
We were home in front of the neighbor.

667
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,640
It's pretty slippery, make me feel free.

668
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,080
Chef Brock gets showed and has to bake a pie.

669
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Well, let it elame, give him the evil and neighbor.

670
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,720
You never acted that way.

671
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,080
In the whole world, you said there's only one need and in your world.

672
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,680
I was happy to be your neighbor.

673
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Oh, with the wood with lady Aberlin, lady Aberlin, she was so pretty.

674
00:24:42,680 --> 00:25:01,120
I came home today with a way on my mind, life isn't simple anymore.

675
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:09,120
But I know where I can find you, you said there's only one need and in your world.

676
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,440
I was happy to be your neighbor.

677
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:22,240
Oh, with the wood with lady Aberlin, you said there's only one need and in your world.

678
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,040
I was happy to be your neighbor.

679
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:37,680
Oh, with the wood with lady Aberlin, lady Aberlin, she was so pretty.

680
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,840
Thank you, friend.

681
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,680
She was so pretty.

682
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,320
Hey, Adam, I just want to give you the quote unquote shout out from Nashville, Tennessee.

683
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
Love your show, love what you're doing, love this whole podcast thing.

684
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
Keep up the good work.

685
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,200
Oh, I am boy online.

686
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,520
Yeah, before that, you heard Lassipia's Bitties.

687
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,920
Yeah, my favorite.

688
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,440
I had their whole new album and I'm allowed to play every single track.

689
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,160
So my does all work through them, digging it that was neighbor.

690
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,320
And you know, you should do that.

691
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,400
You go over and say, how do your neighbor once in a while?

692
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,960
We've got new neighbors now.

693
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,120
We've met the neighbors on the left.

694
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,240
Hope to meet the neighbors on the right pretty soon.

695
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Neighbors are a good thing.

696
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,880
Neighbors are important.

697
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,480
Quick plug for those of you that are new subscribers or, well, actually, the reason I'm doing this

698
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,800
is because, you know, you may only be hearing this on Thursday by the time it gets uploaded.

699
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,240
The BBC's Culture Show will be on BBC 2 Thursday night.

700
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,880
So that's tomorrow night at 7 p.m.

701
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,720
UK time.

702
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,280
So 8 p.m.

703
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,880
You're central European time.

704
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,960
And if you go to bbc.co.uk slash culture, I think that's the link.

705
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,760
I'll make sure I put the correct link in the production notes for today's show.

706
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,360
Then you can probably see a reasonable online archive.

707
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
What they do with the BBC is they're kind of in the middle of trying to figure out what

708
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
they want to do with download.

709
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,920
So they make a download of a show available for about seven days and they take it off,

710
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,880
which is, I guess, is, you know, some kind of loophole in their own policy.

711
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,200
There's also a couple of people who'll be recording a high quality digital version.

712
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,720
And as soon as I get some links, we'll be sure to put that up so you can see it.

713
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I'm pumped.

714
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,880
I'm hoping that it's going to be good.

715
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,520
You never know.

716
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:28,360
And I talked yesterday about extending RSS and how I was working with August and

717
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,400
Ray of iPod Rex and of course with Dave on coming up with some, you know, some interesting

718
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,040
ways of, you know, adding stuff that we really need for our podcast.

719
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,800
One of them is, of course, what I'm working on is these OPML production notes.

720
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,040
And how do we include that and how can we make iPoders aware that there's a show notes

721
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,320
included with the show.

722
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,120
And I haven't been able to respond yet because of my bandwidth woes.

723
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,560
By the way, tomorrow, right after the trash guy comes and I help him load up all the

724
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,960
ship we were accumulated, I'm going to go into town and, and really hop on the, on the

725
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,600
high speed, high Wi-Fi because I'm, I really need to catch up with my podcast.

726
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:18,520
So we now have, yeah, we're working on and I'm looking at it right now, the podcast RSS

727
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:24,440
module, which will be a name space, which I think is going to be really great.

728
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,960
It's really going to give us a lot of the tools that we've been looking for on the

729
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,440
development side of, of ease of use and ease of production and connecting more bits

730
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,040
together in podcasting.

731
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,360
And I guess we'll be releasing this to the iPod of developers list pretty soon.

732
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,040
At first, I, even I had to like, you know, look at this.

733
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Hey, is this right?

734
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Is it really that simple?

735
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,800
This is giving us, if it's giving us everything we want, then it must be wrong.

736
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,440
No, but it was right.

737
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,400
So I'm, I'm way excited about that.

738
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,880
And I just need to get some more bandwidth so I can concentrate a little bit more on this

739
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,600
stuff instead of watching, you know, shit download.

740
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, it's horrible.

741
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Okay.

742
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,720
Boy, we've gone through almost everything I want to do.

743
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,400
Oh, no, there's one thing I wanted to play for you.

744
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,160
And we're currently, what are we at, almost 30 minutes into the show, perfect timing for

745
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
today.

746
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,520
And I'll have to look up who sent this to me.

747
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,120
This is like a new, in your face, hard edge kind of poetry.

748
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,360
It's called disillusioned filibuster.

749
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,680
And it's a, I'm pretty sure it's a live performance piece.

750
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,840
It's totally, you know, performance poetry art.

751
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,240
So it's a little bit distorted, so I'll have to work on the levels.

752
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,600
But listen to it and then, you'll catch on pretty quick.

753
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,320
It's, there's no real title to it, but the whole theme of this disillusioned filibuster

754
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,120
is America, your panties are showing.

755
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,240
They're the night outside, we'll be talking about the life in times of really

756
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,120
cars, where one friend checked another friend and said, yo, you're slick of saying

757
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,120
you're saying, well, I'm telling my friend, my country, America, I can't, I can't, I can't

758
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
see.

759
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Your slip is hanging.

760
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,560
Somebody is looking at your ass, nation building in Iraq, regime changing in Africa,

761
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,120
closing your eyes to genocide in the far, you are showing, you're ass, you showed it, you

762
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,160
showed it, you showed your ass in territory of war, as when you let refugees from

763
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Cuba come to Miami, but you repatriate the Haitians, what they want to come here, you

764
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,160
said, no, back home, told them they couldn't stay, your slip is hanging America, your

765
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,360
slip is hanging right, you ain't got no problems with Mexicans crossing the barrel

766
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,560
because they can work for you for less than minimum wage, they can get involved in rights

767
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,160
labor, they can get involved in being slaves and indentured servants and that's in

768
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,840
your best interest and number one, they can vote for you, the Mexican vote can get you

769
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
elected, so you don't have no problem with them crossing the borders and coming over to

770
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Arizona, no, you don't have no problem with that, America, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't see,

771
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
your slip is hanging.

772
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,840
And you think you think I'm the only one that sees your ass, America, look out the window,

773
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I know this is your house in that, you think you can walk around naked and think you can walk around

774
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,840
disrespecting people, think you can act like you want to, do what you want to because you

775
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,840
in your own house, but America, I can, I can, I can't, I can see, your slip is hanging

776
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,840
and America, I'm not the only one who sees your ass, world of news tonight, so I'll show

777
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,840
you, show your ass in front of the morgue, when you commit a war crimes, breaking the Geneva

778
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,840
contract, show your independence of war on TV, show your independence of war on naked, show

779
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,840
your independence of war being disrespected, show your independence of war, maximize your

780
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,840
slip, your slip is showing America, your slip is showing women, when you capture the president of

781
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Iraq and and show them all TV being interrogated, show them all TV appearing weak and

782
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,840
right, right, when he showed us all TV, when they show us all TV, it becomes a

783
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,840
world crime, from America, America, America, I can, I can, I can, I can see, your slip

784
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,840
is hanging, you are showing your ass to the world, and you are showing your ass to the

785
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,840
black caucus too, every time you will meet with you, you are to wrap up, dial up,

786
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,840
take it up in your whole empire, they're lost to it, service can come to the king unless

787
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,840
they are selling, they're showing them respect, instead of showing them kindness, America,

788
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,840
I show them the black caucus, they are ass, and still we are still so vulnerable

789
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,840
to believe that America is the leading authority of morality, do people of morality go

790
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,840
around stripping in front of people, no, no, people of morality go around showing

791
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,840
their ass to everybody they don't like, hey, no, somebody somewhere needs to say

792
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,840
something, somebody somewhere needs to do something, America, America, your slip is

793
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,840
hanging, America, you are showing your ass like you didn't hate it, when a

794
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,840
democratically elected president of Haiti was told he had to leave a coup d'état

795
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,840
maxi, you want to speak this to this, he was told he had to leave, they, America,

796
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,840
got together with guy for leap and committed a coup d'état and took the

797
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,840
credit of Haiti out to him and his wife, Milquid, you got to leave or die,

798
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,840
or die, or die, or die, America, America, America, America, I can see, I can see,

799
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,840
your slip is hanging, you have a fight another country for democracy and yet

800
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,840
when we have democracy, a democratically elected president in another country, you

801
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,840
don't support him, you would join your truth because he's not doing what you

802
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,840
want him to, he's not being manipulated, he want him to, and because of that,

803
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,840
because of that, you commit a coup d'état, America, America, America,

804
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,840
man, man, can see, I can see your slip, your slip, your slip is hanging,

805
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,840
and I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it, peace, peace.

806
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Man, that's some powerful stuff, now that is exactly what Paul

807
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Boutin, Boutin, Boutin, Boutin, meant when he was talking about why doesn't

808
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Bano use his incredible voice and power through podcasting to start to change

809
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
the world.

810
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Yeah, sure it's great that we can sell a black eye pod with all the YouTube

811
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,840
songs on it, but why don't we add a little something else there, Bano?

812
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Shoot dude, you've got your own freaking eye pod.

813
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Is it just a thought maybe to put something on there?

814
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,840
You know, like, hey, feed the world or something, just put a couple MP3,

815
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,840
I'll do good with you Bano, put an AAC file on there, you know, so it's bookmarkable

816
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,840
and it's D-R-M, perfect, go for it, dude, that would be awesome.

817
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,840
That just blew me away, I mean it's more about Haiti at the end there, but just the whole,

818
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,840
yeah, you know, disillusioned filibuster, pretty interesting stuff.

819
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
And that's it for today's source code.

820
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,840
More bandwidth tomorrow as we slipper away the Wi-Fi.

826
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
until I get some real bandwidth.

827
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,840
And again, I'll be downloading lots of stuff.
