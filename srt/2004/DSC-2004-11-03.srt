1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Before we get started, let me remind you of the following.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,120
The results of events predicted in these things

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,000
may be very materialistic from actual results.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Doctors that could cause actual events

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,800
results to differ from expectations included,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
lack of growth, intense competition in our industry,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,840
integration failures, changes in government regulations,

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
operational failures, or looking to England's representatives.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,160
All right, so with volumes of today,

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,240
it should not be relied upon as representing our nation

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
and the depth of any subsequent case.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
While we name the lights up, they call it,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,480
let me tell you the truth of the future.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,680
We need to, not to be so even for an interesting thing.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,120
Augustine, all's live!

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,320
Adam Curry!

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,880
Our honor to all of you.

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,280
Howdy everybody, and good evening!

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,160
From the bunker in Amsterdam, being head of the lens,

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,240
it's your daily source code for Wednesday, November 3, 2004.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,640
Post-delection and post-exceptance speech

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,440
of our president George Dembibber.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,680
The power of the Lord is strong!

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Well, I'm here in the bunker, since I'm staying overnight here.

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
I want to be on time at the airport.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,920
My flight leaves at five minutes as well,

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,160
and I've had to come out and come from Belgium.

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,680
I would like to leave around the shoot for 7 a.m.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
to make sure that I, uh, we get stuck in traffic on my way to the airport.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,560
So much easier to stay here, while we still have the place.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
Yeah, like it's selling really fast. I think not.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,360
And by the way, if you're really rich, and you want a cool place

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
to rent an Amsterdam, let me know.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,760
It's like a really cool pad, okay?

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,920
I mean, like a chick magnet pad.

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,440
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,160
All right, let's get this podcast going for today.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,000
Just watch President Bush,

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,560
except for that of course I'll have a little bit of John Kerry's

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:10,920
speech as well well there you have it that's the ball game I was you know I

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,800
got a kind of a weird feeling watching the popular boat which of course is

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
also very interesting and there was a definite 3 million margin there there's

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,400
no dispute and apparently the first time since George H. Walker Bush was a

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,440
president that they not only the electoral votes were one but also the

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,480
popular vote and there was that you know that minute or so that I'm saying wow you

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,880
know I'm in the minority not used to that but oh sorry but as I was just

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,040
talking to Christina my daughter my 14 year old daughter on the father said well

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,280
you know the way the way we do it in America is if our you know if your guy

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,320
isn't chosen as president then you you got to support the guy that was chosen

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,120
and respect the majority in the vote but you know I see it as a great

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,320
opportunity for keeping our eye on the ball and getting ready for the next

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,720
election as as I heard Dave say on a mini podcast on his way to San Francisco

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,760
in the car you know one thing we know for sure in four years Bush will definitely

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,120
be out of the White House so plenty of opportunity and you know wouldn't be

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,400
nice if we got a blogger in the White House in in 2008 now Christina is

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,840
really angry she's pissed off and she's particularly pissed off she came up with

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,880
some statistic and I think she put it on her weblog she has a weblog that is

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,640
pretty much a good Charlotte weblog for the band good Charlotte it's called the

59
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,680
land of the young in the hopeless calm which points actually to Christina

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,640
dot menilla sites dot com now she's a vanilla user from way back when that

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,120
service was first native available for free and of course it's still

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,160
supported by the good folks at user land and she was really pissed about

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,240
this statistic that only one out of ten americans under the age of twenty

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,560
four voted and she said you know she's saying you know what the hell was all

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,840
those rock against Bush CDs you know they sold so many CDs but where are

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,560
these people they didn't go and vote they just couldn't be bothered to get up

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,040
off of their ass and I was really impressed you know with the with the

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,000
just with the fire that the girl has you know so she's just super

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
disappointed I said well you know we've got all the tools we've got our web

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,280
blogs we've got our podcasts and you know we can keep an eye on these guys and I

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,360
like buddies from Morocco when I went when I was over there after Taylor from

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,920
Hulk was murdered at the coffee shop so there was an old's a proverb in in Morocco

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,080
that was and of course it loses something in the translation he kind of

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,080
translated it from Arabic to French slash Dutch and I'm gonna translate it

75
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,400
from that into English but basically the same says that there's no way that you

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,360
can gain a better new friend by dropping an old friend even if you hate him

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
because you never know enough about a new friend there is no such thing as a

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,760
new best friend and as I said it loses a little bit in the translation but I

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,000
think I think what you know the point here is and maybe this is a point that

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Republicans had all along and maybe they have a point that maybe this is not

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,760
the time to switch you know we know this guy I know he's up to no good a lot of

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,800
other people know he's up to no good I think we can certainly stump that out we

83
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,160
should be able to and it you know it might have taken four years anyway to to

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,600
rid all of the you know the horrible connections that are and you know the

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,240
relationships and all the stuff that's that's going on in big business and

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,280
big government and et cetera et cetera so what better way for everyone who

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,320
voted for Kerry who's a little bit bummed out now and of course you know we've

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,480
got some attitude and judgment to do there's no better way to just kind of

89
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,160
shake it all out of your system by sharing it with the homosexuals for

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,160
me I guess that's why they call it the blues Elton John on your daddy's

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,200
source code don't wish it away don't look at it like it's forever

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:41,120
between you and me I could almost accept the things I don't get better

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:56,120
and while I'm away just don't feel on the inside and I want to belong

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:04,880
before you and they're wrong please stay at our hearts we'll we're high

95
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:17,240
and I guess that's why they call it the blues John on my hands

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:26,240
we'll be tough man with you let me look like children let them like lovers

97

103
