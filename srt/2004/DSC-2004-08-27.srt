00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Hi everybody, it is the source code for Friday, August 27th, 2004.

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Good afternoon or good morning or good evening, wherever you are, wherever you're listening

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
to this, either you clicked on the link on the website or you might be subscribing to

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
it through RSS.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Thank you very much for subscribing.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I've been thinking a lot about what we need to do with this show in particular

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
because I'm even getting pretty bored of talking about myself.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
And then last night it hit me as I was trying to get to sleep around, I had to go to bed

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,500
early, only two more days, Monday and Tuesday, the last two days of the morning show.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,500
And I was thinking that really what maybe at this audio blog or audio show can be about,

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
maybe it can just be really for users and developers to bring them together.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
I mean, I'm...

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
100% a user on all sides of the broadcast equation.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I really like receiving stuff and I like making stuff,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
sending it out as well.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And I think that so far we've been pretty successful at

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
bringing together a number of developers to work on the

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
iPod platform and get stuff working.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And these may not even be developers per se.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
These could be just users who have a little more

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
knowledge and experience at making the computers do things

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
that they want them to do.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I'm going to see if at all we can make this a

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
platform of its own for users and developers.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And if you have a comment, obviously you can leave a

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
comment on the web blog or send me an email

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
adamantcurry.com.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But maybe if you have something to contribute, you can

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
create your own audio blog post.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Send me a URL point to it and I'll pick it up.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then maybe we can share some of your ideas or

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
questions or stuff that you're looking for or things that we

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,500
need to make our computers do and how we can connect them all together through the internet.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,500
And I made a very important discovery yesterday, although the application wiretap for Mac OS

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,500
10 had been pointed out to me a couple of times by people in my quest for getting the right

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,500
audio software to record these with.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
The interface really, I had downloaded it, I think the interface just confused me so

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
much. I didn't realize that it does exactly what I wanted to do, namely record all the

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
audio that would normally come out of my speaker. I want that recorded digitally just by listening

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
to the core audio bits or whatever it is. And that's exactly what wiretap does. I didn't

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,500
think it did because when I looked at the preferences file and I think it's selected by default,

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
it says save files to and then you give it a place to save to and then it says

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,500
you can add prefix if you want, which can be the aim. And so when I clicked on the application

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
name it seemed only to want to save files.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
save files with the application name that was at the front that was recording.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I figured well it only records one application at a time.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then yesterday while I was doing the source code, Cindy Camilleri came online on iChat

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and since she doesn't come online when usually when I am because we are in different, she's

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
in New York and I'm in obviously in Belgium.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I always have iChat saying you know, Skipper is here which is her nickname, Skipper.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And I heard the iChat alert that she was online while I was recording and I didn't think that

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you'd hear it.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But then I listened back to the yesterday show, yep sure enough it was there.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I started experimenting and indeed it records everything.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So instead of a mixing console now in front of me, I basically have all my applications

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
open that I normally use to play bits of audio or use in an audio show like this.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have three quick time windows open.

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,500
the Rachmaninoff remix which is, well, by default now become the tune for source code.

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I have a song of the day all queued up and also I have iTunes standing by in case I think

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
of something I need to search and iTunes is great for that, just typing your search

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
and immediately you get your results.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Okay, before I go on to with more about what source code could be and a little update

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,500
on iPodder, here's something that came in through my own iPodder, at least I'm using

64
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:46,500
the get enclosure.pearl script and this came in from, what was this, blog digger

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,500
and this is from their their media RSS file and apparently some German guy has

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,500
written a book called blogs and his name is Don Alfonso and here is an audio

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
show that was out there on the internet somewhere and I just want to play a

68
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
little bit of it because it's kind of cool to hear Germans talk about web logs.

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
15.40, you can hear the exact same thing in Germany.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
These texts are only available on the Internet.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The book is a special logbook for the reader.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It shows a new world and often also a radical point of view.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The book is about blogs.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The title of the book is also published in the beginning of September in the book of Schwarzkopf and Schwarzkopf.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A book published by Don Alfonso and Kai...

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What's the name again?

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don Alfonso?

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Kai-Pal.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Exactly.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Kai-Pal.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The book is about blogs.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
16 webloggers write about text and form on the Internet and why they take over the Internet.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I love it.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, so if you read German there's a book called Blogs.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Blogs is out now in Germany.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, so about the source code, I'd like to see this turn into some form of a platform

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
where users and developers can talk about how we can work together and make our collective lives better.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I know one thing for sure that all of the...

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
users I know, if they are using shareware and they use it consistently or if there's a registration

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
fee.

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Most everyone always says the same thing, hey, I want to pay my dues and make sure people

92
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
get paid.

93
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
So I think there is a market there.

94
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,500
It's probably on a per user basis, small license fees, but there's a lot of software to be

95
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,500
made and if we can aggregate the ideas when it comes to per topic, obviously, then

96
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,500
maybe we can get some economies of scale going like has happened with iPodder.

97
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,500
So the history real quick, I created this script, an Apple script that takes a list of

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,500
RSS feeds with MP3 enclosures, downloads those and contrary to popular belief, by the way,

99
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
it does check to see if the file has already been downloaded.

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,500
It doesn't download again unless the file has been removed because I use the curl

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
minus F switch.

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
It downloads them and then it transfers them to your iTunes, which if you have a

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
iPod automatically syncs up to your iPod and in iTunes it actually creates a playlist which

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
is equal or equivalent to the name of the channel that or the RSS feed that you're downloading.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It takes all that information from the RSS feed.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So a couple different versions showed up.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We have a Pearl version which I'm actually using myself now and there is now a Windows

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
version and apparently there's nothing extra to install, no bits that you need.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So I'm going to just download the script and it's good to go.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's made by Peter Overbeke and I'm pretty sure he's Dutch.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I haven't met him other than online.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I've linked to him today on my web blog.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's opportunities.nl slash wordpress and he even sent me a ping about it because he's

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
up to, he's done like three versions now and it's really ready to be tested.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So please give Peter's script a test because if we can get this working for Windows, and

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
by the way it works with the iTunes, the Windows version of iTunes.

117
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,500
If we can get this working, then this concept of an iPod platform, meaning all mp3 devices,

118
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,500
that can download stuff without you doing anything and just have shows ready for you, I think

119
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,500
we're just on the verge of a huge potential being unleashed here.

120
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
So again, if you could, and I've linked to it on my web blog, check out the iPodder

121
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
for Windows and let's say get some feedback on how it's doing and if it's working and if it's

122
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,500
performing. And then of course, the next step, which is needed for both platforms, both for

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Windows and the Mac, and for Linux and anything else that we can find that people have this desire,

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:07,500
is getting the shows, the mp3s from iTunes to non-ipod mp3 players. And I have a feeling

125
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,500
that's going to be a little bit more challenging. So just about at the end for today, yes, that was

126
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
really long time.

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
them. As I said, I'm trying to keep these around 15 minutes, which is, you know, just believing

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
in Andy Warhol's vision.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Today, 14 years ago, Patricia turned to me and said, we need to get this child up. And

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
we knew that we were going to have a C-section way ahead of time because Christina was a

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
breach. And we went to the hospital and Dr. Ladosi was there and Dr. Sony, the wife

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sony with an eye at the hospital, St. Barnabas in New Jersey. And they said, okay,

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you know, we're gonna have this kid today. And it was around seven o'clock and it was

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
a really great vibe in the operating room. And as the doctor literally picked

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Christina up out of Patricia, it was just an amazing sight. On the radio, it

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
was Light FM was on and the Beatles in my life started to play. And it was

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
something that we will never, ever forget. Now, of course, it would be easy for me

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to play.

139
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
the Beatles right now and we'd all have an emotional moment.

140
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,500
But since my daughter, Christina, turns 14 today, I figure I'd honor her since she does

141
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,500
share the bar slash recording studio slash computer room with me.

142
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I'd honor her by playing the brand new song by her favorite band.

143
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
And of course, I need to remind you that you do have to vote for them for the viewers'

144
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,500
choice for the upcoming MTV Video Music Awards, which I believe are next Wednesday.

145
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
They're all time favorite and I've met these guys.

146
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
They are great, broke, bunch of musicians, very, very talented.

147
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Is Good Charlotte.

148
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Check out their new one, Predictable.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm still I don't know why

150
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not switchin'

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I knew it all along

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You're so predictable

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I knew something would go wrong

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's all a way back

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So you don't have to call

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll say anything at all

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're so predictable

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're so predictable

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So take your red tip

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's your broken promises

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And all the time you stole

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because I am done with this

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can give it away, give it away

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm doing everything I should've

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And now I'm making a change

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm living to death

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm giving back what you gave it

168
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't need anything

169
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I knew it all along

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're so predictable

171
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I did something with you

172
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm in the middle of a fight

173
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I see you now, I have to go

174
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I say anything at all

175
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
So free to bow

176
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm in the middle of a fight

177
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Everyone needs every time I travel

178
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm in the middle of a fight

179
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm so broken, I'm so cold

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm so hurt inside, I'm so scared

181
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
I'm afraid of, I don't even know

182
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
The story's been running out of here

183
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm searching for a way

184
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm dreaming you won't come back

185
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
I want you in my story

186
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm ready to come and fight

187
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I knew it all along, you're so pretty to phone I knew something would go wrong, and I'm fine

188
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:33,500
You don't have to call, I'll say anything at all, so pretty to phone

189
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Good Charlotte, predictable.

190
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,500
And believe me, I am just cherishing for as long as possible the fact that my daughter

191
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
and I actually like a lot of the same music.

192
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
So that's their new one.

193
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
And be on the lookout for the CD.

194
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Right.

195
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Okay, that's it for the source code for today.

196
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Just within my 15 minute time limit weekend coming up.

197
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
And then two more shows Monday and Tuesday, got a big party.

198
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
And then my new life starts.

199
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,500
And I can get to, well, the one thing I want to start doing is having the source code up

200
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,500
and available every morning before, preferably before 8 o'clock East Coast time in the United

201
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
States.

202
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
All right, well, have yourselves a great weekend.

203
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Hopefully you'll check out the shows this Saturday and Sunday.

204
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
If not, talk to you on Monday and have a good one.

205
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Bye-bye.

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The power of your intelligence.

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The power of your intelligence.
