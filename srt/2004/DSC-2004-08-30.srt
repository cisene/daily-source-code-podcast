1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good morning, good morning, good evening, wherever you might be, checking out the source code.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Adam Curry, it is Monday, August 30th, 2004.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And sorry about the weekend, I just didn't feel like doing anything really.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And quite honestly, I liked that a lot.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So why don't we agree that the source code is going to be a weekday feature.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And I will as often as possible, try to have something up Sunday night so that you

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
can listen to it on your Monday morning commute.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And God, I'd always like to have it ready for you for your morning commute.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it's Adam Curry coming to you from Curry Council in Belgium.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tomorrow is the very last radio show that I do on the very last morning show that I do

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for Veronica Radio.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As a big party afterwards.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:11,500
last until late probably. So that being said, you may not expect a source code tomorrow

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:19,500
just because of all the festivities. But otherwise, I'm going to turn this into a daily feature

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
that should be up every morning between 7 and 8 New York time.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,500
And the source code, as we discussed last time, which was last Friday, it's where users

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,500
and developers come to party, right? And when I thought about that over the weekend, we

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
have so many things that we can be doing. And there are projects that we're working on.

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,500
One of the projects, of course, is iPodder. And by now we have a shoot, I don't know,

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,500
we must have five different versions of it, all kind of doing the same thing. And I think

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,500
that what we probably need is some central place other than a weblog where we can, especially

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
when we branch out and do a project like this, we can keep track of it all because there's

23
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
a stuff is falling between.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the cracks, we don't have a central place. And I'm notoriously very bad at organizing

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that kind of stuff. And then I thought maybe we should start a source forge page, a source

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
forge.org, which is, I presume is really good for managing projects, development projects,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
because we've had a new release of iPodder for Windows, which I will talk about a little

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
bit later. But that's exciting because now we have something that actually does the same thing

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
that we've been using on our Macs for a couple of weeks now. All you do is you run the script

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that goes out, it checks a file of feeds to bring in the enclosures, it puts them all

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
into their own directory, and it actually controls iTunes on Windows. So yeah, with that

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
script, and I will talk about that a bit later because I have a couple of, I have some thoughts

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
about it, with that script and an iPod, you can automatically have your iPod updated.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So it seems like we're talking more and more about technology from a user and a developer

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
perspective.

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,500
And actually I wasn't going to mention this until Gmail went live, but I was so hurt

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,500
up until this morning that I didn't have a Gmail account.

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
It seems like everybody in the world had a Gmail account.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Everybody got one from their friend.

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Personally, I would have expected one from Google themselves, but didn't get that.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
And it wasn't until this morning when my co-host on the radio show said, hey, I got a Gmail

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
account.

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Would you like one?

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Can you be my Gmail friend?

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
So I'll be looking into that.

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
And I'm sure that as that goes live, there will be a lot to talk about.

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Google seems to be doing some pretty exciting stuff.

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Let me think about video and audio blogging.

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I had some thoughts about that because more and more is happening now.

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I've been checking out more audio blogs and video blogs in the past couple of days.

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:05,500
And to me, it is crystal clear that we can make a huge jump start with our video.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
with distributing bundles of passion.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's Dave Slusher would call it.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or content or whatever,

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
just this kind of shit.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The shit we want to share with each other, thank you.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That is it.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And the infrastructure is already there.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you have a web,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
if you're going to a video or audio blog,

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you're going to post something,

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you want to distribute it,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you want to publish it,

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you want to get out to the world,

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you may already,

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you probably already have a,

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
some kind of blog software.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And all the bits are there,

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
with RSS 2.0,

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the enclosures,

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
the aggregators aren't quite there yet.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Of course, we're now building our own aggregators,

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
essentially making our devices aggregators.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then I think is where we have to take our mindset,

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we have to get beyond the computer

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
so that when someone who just doesn't need to understand

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
how it works is told,

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
well, you can subscribe to this show,

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
all they should have to do is think of,

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
okay, I installed this software.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't know where it went, it's gone,

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it says thank you very much, it'll work now.

83
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,500
have to do is jack in my iPod every day or charge it as usual and new stuff just shows up.

84
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
So that is where we have to get to that part. And everything in between I think can be done

85
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:25,500
at the desktop level with, well, they'd be communicating to a blog server or it could be something

86
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
just as simple as putting up an RSS feed on an FTP site. You know, there are all different

87
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,500
versions of that that'll work. For publishing, for receiving, we really have to take out all that

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:45,500
all that middle stuff. Excuse me. We're very, very, very close. But still, it feels like,

89
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,500
by default, and it's not wrong, but it feels like we are approaching it from

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,500
possibly a difficult angle. Because what I see people doing is saying, okay, I'm going to make a

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,500
weblog entry and then I'm going to attach a video blog to that where really what you want is you want

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,500
your DVD player or whatever it is, whatever device is going to be...

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
sitting in front of your viewing station.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now that could very well be a computer,

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but in some cases maybe it should be your television.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And that device also has to be an aggregator.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It has to be perceived as an aggregator

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in order for people to understand what we're trying to do.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Because that's the simplest.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You just don't have to think about it.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It shows up.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're going to hit all kinds of speed bumps

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
when it comes to subscriptions.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I mean, we already saw that with web logs.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because eventually you're going to have to tell people,

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
please copy your L, paste it into this file, and then it'll be OK.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And even that's too much.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do we go with preference pains or how do we do with that?

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So these are all thoughts that we need to talk about.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I really would like some feedback on that.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, by the way, I've lowered the bit rate on source code

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so that the quality should remain reasonably decent.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the file size will just go down a bit

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
because, man, we're really eating a hard drive space doing this.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I mean, that's exactly what I knew would happen.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Once.

117
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
minute you get into something and you're developing and you want shows to be there for

118
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
other developers to work on nothing's worse than creating an aggregator and nothing coming

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
in, right?

120
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,500
And on that point, consumer note, about a year and a half ago we did a reality show about

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
us, which was broadcast here in the Netherlands.

122
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
And what was cool about it is we also produced it ourselves.

123
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,500
And we did the entire thing on Final Cut Pro and used the Firewire drives and DV cams.

124
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
And the only, I think, real professional part that we used was besides people who knew

125
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,500
what they were doing, professionally trained people, a lot of experience and video production.

126
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Well, we bought some good wireless mics, the one I'm using right now.

127
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,500
We also bought about two terabytes worth of storage data from Lassie.

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,500
And I just wanted to touch on that because I'm not too happy with the way, well, first

129
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
of all, with their product.

130
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
We have a whole slew of the, you know, see how big it is.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
these are 80 gigs, I think.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, I think it's 80 gig drive, LeCise, which are fire wire.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They have their own power supply, which is kind of a drag by itself, but it didn't matter.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
These are, they look at, they look the part, you know, of heavy duty industrial hard drives.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We also got a couple of the two of the half terabytes, like 550 gigabyte drives, which we

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
affectionately called the big swinging disc.

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And within a year's time, and some a little bit longer, usually just outside the warranty,

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
80% of these drives has failed.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
80% which is a real hassle when you're in the middle of producing something that has to

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
get on the air and you just have to move on with stuff, particularly when you're using

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Final Cut Pro where you render everything after the fact.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So you're always working up against the deadline of knowing that you'll have to have at least

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
an hour or two hours or sometimes long depending on how many layers of video and audio you

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
have for it to render.

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
out. And then you select to go through post audio and sound sweetening. So it's a real

146
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
drag when you have to stop in the middle and something's fucked up and you've lost

147
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
your data essentially. Well, it turns out you haven't lost your data with these LICI drives.

148
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:36,500
The bus, the firewire bus, this is according to LICI, burns out very easily with max because

149
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,500
of a discrepancy in the voltage of the Macintosh firewire port. Now, I know that these things aren't

150
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,500
quite fleshed out as a standard, but they definitely sell the C drives as a Macintosh compatible.

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,500
And they know about this problem. So it really pisses me off that we've had so many failures

152
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,500
in all such sort times as well. And they won't replace the ports. They'll give you a new drive

153
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,500
if it's under warranty. But they won't just say, okay, well, because my data's on these discs,

154
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
right, it's just sitting there and it's spinning and it's happy. It's just not getting any joy

155
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
from through firewire. So it's just not being asked to do anything.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And they don't want to replace the ports.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They say, well, you could buy another drive, and then you could switch the actual platters

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or the drives and you, you know, like fuck that, fuck that.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is me off.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This should be better.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Anyway, until further notice, I strongly recommend you do not purchase LaCe FireWire drives

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
if you're intending on doing anything that you do that, where you care about your data.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Quite honestly, that's just about everything.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, down to iPodder for a second here.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now, as I've been looking around the net, looking at what people are doing, there is an incredible

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
amount of work that already has been done on iTunes.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, just a massive amount, all kinds of scripts to do the most wacky things you could think

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
of and not one single person except for the people who have been working on iPodder has

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
come up with anything even close to it.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So this, I mean, first of all, there's a lot of people wanting to make iTunes and I.

171
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
iPod, do more stuff, and I'd like to try and capitalize on that and get people interested

172
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,500
and excited in being able to spread shows around and subscribe to stuff simply and make

173
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,500
it easy for people and really connect your iPod to something and pull out all of the fodder

174
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
of downloading and transferring and updating and creating playlists.

175
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Now, we'll do that all for you and make it completely automatic.

176
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,500
In fact, I was thinking that if we could come up with three versions that we all love of iPod

177
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
or whatever.

178
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,500
It could be for a Mac, for Windows, for Linux, whatever we need it for.

179
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
That a site that or someone who wants to distribute audio, or in this case, audio, that they

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,500
could actually distribute that program or any version of that or link to a download page

181
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,500
that would come with only their feed file and then you could add to it yourself.

182
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
We should be able to open that up somehow and make it work for everybody.

183
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Now, Peter created iPodder for...

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Windows and I'm really excited about this because what I did is I took the

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
time to work on to work on it. Check it out on Windows 2000.

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Professional have that running on a laptop here. I haven't worked with Windows

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
in a long time. That's worked pretty snappy compared to the Mac. It's a little

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
bit faster, but anyway, that's a whole different discussion. So you download his

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
script, which is runs on Windows. Something Windows scripting. There is a little

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
note about it in the readme file. And all you have to basically do is just make

191
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
sure that you have the scripting engine on your machine. Mine had it, so I

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
presume that's probably the fault installed these days with Windows, although I

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
don't know for sure. And I also need iTunes, which I didn't have yet. So I downloaded

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
iTunes, that ran. Then I fired up the script. I saw it go out. It has little

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Windows telling me what it's doing. And then it failed because I hadn't set the

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
download directory, which you have to do manually in the feeds file. I was set to

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
D, colon, back.

198
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I said it to my own download directory, my own download drive.

199
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
So then I ran it again and boom, it worked.

200
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I brought the stuff in, it updated the iTunes playlist.

201
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Fucking fantastic.

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
And this is so important because as much as I love my Mac,

203
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
it's death if you think we can do anything just doing it on the Mac.

204
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
We've got to get Windows involved.

205
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
So the only thing I'd really like and maybe there's something we only talk about

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
after we get some kind of page up or we work on this development together.

207
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,500
So if we have a source source, source for page or something of the like

208
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,500
is if we could just take one little step and if we have an installer.

209
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
And this is the way I dream it.

210
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
For Windows and Mac doesn't matter Linux or whatever.

211
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,500
You download this program, you've got to be very clear what it does.

212
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You know, the description has to say, turns your iPod into an aggregator.

213
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
You know, connect to show subscribe whatever it is.

214
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
We've got to work on that language.

215
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You download it, you install it, it says, okay, here's what I'm doing.

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm doing where do you want the files to be downloaded?

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You select a directory boom.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's your download directory.

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It checks to see if you have iTunes installed.

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It checks to see if you have the right scripting environment

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
on Windows or whatever it is.

222
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Just run through a couple of checks.

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If not download it, do it seamlessly.

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's the thing that the only thing that's really wrong

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
with iPodder for the Mac is you have to download

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
this X and L tool in order for it to work.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That should be automatic for people.

228
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
They shouldn't have to do anything,

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
but double click and just answer one or two questions

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and maybe select a download directory.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And then it is, and by the way,

232
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
it should also set up a cron job

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and we should explain what we're doing.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That maybe you can make that configurable for the user

235
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
later on.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I want to check that these intervals

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
are these times to see if there's new shows.

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Maybe we don't tell them about it all,

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but we have to let them know that we're making

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
the computer do something, obviously.

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And that should be all set up automatically.

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And it should download a first couple of files.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And then notification is something.

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
else. Personally, I don't think we need a notification, but maybe we could just create a

245
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,500
smart playlist, which I've done in my setup. Whenever there's new content, new shows

246
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:39,500
that bundles of passion, Dave, that come in from out there, that particular playlist is

247
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,500
updated as well. So the different ways to do the notification, maybe there's more options

248
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,500
in there. Maybe you want to receive an email that, hey, the new show is up. So that would

249
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
be just wonderful. I'd love to get some feedback on that. Particularly on what we should do

250
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
on centralizing some of this development works. I don't want it to just kind of dribble out.

251
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,500
We need to get this going. And then we need to talk to people, getting them to support

252
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,500
what we're doing. IT conversations is already great. Dave Liner's coffee notes. He just did

253
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,500
an update the other day from the cars. He's driving through Madison, Wisconsin. Dave Slusher,

254
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,500
there's so many people already getting into this that I think we're still on a good track.

255
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
We just need to centralize some things.

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, here's something that's interesting about the big rock and roll dudes.

257
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
MTV Video Music Awards were last night in the States for the first time for Miami.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Of course, now I have a 14-year-old who's even more interested in the show than I am.

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Check this out.

260
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Even though they pertain to have a global television network, which they do, of course, and they

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
have lots of potential viewers, the show did not air live in Europe on any of the MTV stations

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
as far as I'm aware.

263
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It won't air until Wednesday, mind you, when everyone already knows who's won.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The disappointment, the good Charlotte didn't win.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Viewers Choice Award was pretty big this morning in the Curry Household, but so all of

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that's already been done.

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then they're going to broadcast like an edited or watered down version of the award show,

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
where I want the full three-hour, raunchy, whatever shit goes on show.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
In fact, I'd actually pay money to have the totally unsensored version, if there wasn't

270
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
anything to be censored.

271
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So, I'm hoping fingers crossed that someone out there recorded it and we'll put it...

272
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
up a bit torrent because it's just ridiculous.

273
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
And MTV should be doing that themselves.

274
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
They're crazy.

275
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Now, why do we have to wait three days until we can see it?

276
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
It makes no sense to me for any award show.

277
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,500
The Academy Awards aren't that dense about it.

278
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,500
And actually, BitTorrent works great for those moments when you want something big like Windows

279
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Service Pack 2, which was also distributed via BitTorrent, which has appeared to be your

280
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
sharing system.

281
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
And really, it's what they call it, file swarming or whatever.

282
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
And it adds funny because I spoke to Dave briefly.

283
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:10,500
And remember, he wanted to load up on some movies for when he got the Canada.

284
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And well, basically, I said, you know, if you're looking for older movies, take a while

285
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
to download, because you may only have one or two or three people or maybe only one seeding

286
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
that particular file.

287
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,500
So it could take a long time to download what really works great when something's new or something's

288
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:26,500
really...

289
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
popular. And then I gave him of course a couple of torrents to some new porn movies.

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So he understood that and he came back and said, well, if I just want some old Saturday night

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
live episodes, how do I get that? I said, well, you can probably find it. There may be someone

292
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
seeding that online, but probably unlikely. And he came up with an idea is, well, maybe we

293
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
all have to just kind of put a weblog together and we'll update each other and say, hey, today

294
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Saturday night live day and we all put our stuff up online and we become, in effect, the transmitter.

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You know what? Ad hoc transmitter gives everyone a zippy download who joins the group.

296
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know, it's interesting to think about because that could be pretty powerful if you can create

297
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that kind of bandwidth. Ad hoc and just doing it as end users are not someone in the middle.

298
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Not quite sure how it'll work, but I do think that we all could, yeah, we can definitely all get

299
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
together and make it happen. She wears it take, you know, run a little script somewhere or just open

300
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
something up and leave it running. Shouldn't be a problem at all. And likewise, for the song of the

301
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
And I've already gone way over my time limit, but I do want to play a song of the day for you.

302
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
It was very easy to download this one.

303
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:42,500
I had 53 hosts within seconds, and yet it's a song that's over 20 years old.

304
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:50,500
The unfortunate news reached everybody, just the other just yesterday, that Laura Branigan

305
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
passed away.

306
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,500
She died in upstate New York, East Cog, I think, 47-year-old, 47 years old of an aneurysm.

307
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I didn't know her very well, but we had met a couple of times, both in Holland and somewhere

308
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
in TV.

309
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm thinking Marty Grah.

310
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,500
So that's why I probably don't remember very well.

311
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,500
But it's shocking when someone that young goes.

312
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Anyway, we have our music to remember by.

313
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Not many hits from Laura Branigan, but this is one that everyone remembers.

314
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,500
And I just wanted to play it for you so we can all think about her, her self-control.

315
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's the night, turn around in the night

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Look, roll, do the world something break

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Where in my eyes you're walking down the street

318
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm not so good

319
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Take myself, take myself, roll, roll

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Come here, and only do the night

321
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:41,500
You take me to you take my down come close

322
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I love the night I love the night

323
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I let the sky, I set you on the earth

324
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But you can't do it, you can't do it

325
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You take the sun, you take the sun

326
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hi! I'm a creature tonight

327
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I hope you lose the wings

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Against the moon, the marks I can't stop

329
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I need it, tomorrow I'm not allowed

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm really not

331
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I know the light is new

332
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm a spirit, I'm a spirit

333
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Something's fun, make myself believe it

334
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
This night will never go

335
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm a spirit, I'm a spirit

336
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
All the night, it's like a pain to go

337
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
In the day, nothing matters

338
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's like a time of time

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm on the Greece of the Philippines

340
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I have a number of women trying to fight

341
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm a person, a mouth, a white, a sound just leaving

342
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
To my old, a ghost

343
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I said, night, I really didn't know

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm a lady, it's not a day

345
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I must leave, something's wrong

346
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Make myself believe it, it's night, we never go

347
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'm a woman, a woman

348
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Oh

349
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,500
So just imagine everyone running off to the record store trying to buy that single by Laura Brandt again just to remember

350
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
By no way wouldn't happen. It's just not in stock. It's not possible

351
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Through Peter Peer. It was very easy. The download was amazing. It only took about 40 seconds to bring it in.

352
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,500
And they're going to wind up the source code with that today. So tomorrow of course I have the final morning radio show

353
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,500
That could mean that there may not be a source code up or maybe may very very late

354
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
And as of September 1st that's when we start

355
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
new life. And tomorrow, by the way, I'm going to play a new song in my wife made. She's

356
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
working on a DVD of her career, which spans 40 years, and she's recording a couple new

357
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
tracks. And I've got one that I will share with you tomorrow. So we'll see you then on

358
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
the source code, everybody, until then, take care.

359
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:37,000

361
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Because of the time when we're all together, we're not allowed to be together anymore.

362
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
I've been bored of seeing you every day and time.

363
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
But you're not allowed to be with me.

364
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I'll stay by your side.

365
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll stay by your side and time.

366
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I'll stay by your side and time.

367
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
I'll stay by your side and time.
