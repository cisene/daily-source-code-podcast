00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Hi everybody. Welcome to a very short daily source code for Thursday, December 2, 2004. I'm

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,720
a little bit pissed off. We did all day for my DSL line to be switched on, made all kinds

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,240
of other decisions and choices which did not involve going to Starbucks, thinking I have

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,040
plenty of time to do all my prepping and get all my stuff ready and have everything all

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,080
set to go for a source code. So I didn't work out and so I just decided to be almost

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:39,360
not online today and went analog, went out and bought some newspapers and I got the

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,440
Guardian, which I've known and I read online, I've been subscribed to their RSS feeds

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:53,520
for a long time. The Guardian.co.uk and picked up the paper version today and in the

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,120
G2 section, it's like a page and a half spread with a great graphic titled personal

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,080
soundtracks. Audio programming has become cheap and easy to make and has led to the rapid

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,440
spread of the podcasting phenomenon, then hammerously reports. There is an online version

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,880
and tomorrow I'll link to that. But I think it's very cool and it's just awesome to be cited

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:32,960
as, here it comes, Adam Curry, a London-based weblogger. Okay, almost got it right. So instead

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,840
of doing a regular source code, I want to read this one column to you from another part

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,920
of the Guardian. Actually it's a comment and analysis. So let me see, yeah, Felicity

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,200
Lauren, she's the Guardian Consumer Affairs correspondent. I did this column just really struck

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,960
me. I don't know if there is even an online version of it or not, but I enjoyed reading

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,320
this and it gave me a lot to think about and maybe it will do the same for you. So on

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,640
today's source code, I yield the floor for the distinguished gentleman, Felicity Lawrence.

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,240
This food racket just can't go on. A full-scale consumer rebellion is needed to change the

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,680
way we eat. That comes at point in most discussions about how to help people eat better

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,720
when everybody gets stuck on cheese. If you would have traffic lights on food, read for

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,680
bad, dream for good, orange for in between, what on earth would you do with cheese? This is

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
the point at which the absurdity of the food debate overwhelms me. It's not that I'm against

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,560
traffic lights. Actually, I think they might help a bit. It's just that when the car's

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,760
been hijacked and you're herdling in the wrong direction, I'm not sure they are up to

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,440
the job on on their own. Our food is being produced in a way that has devastating consequences

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,840
for the environment, for social justice, and for our individual health. In less than a

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,040
generation, it has been industrialized and globalized. Processed food is routinely adulterated

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,680
with artery clogging fats, a besegenic sugars and constipating starches, which are then disguised

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,920
by chemical colorings and flavorings without which they would be unpalatable. We have come

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,760
to depend on this junk food, and it is making us sick. On nutritionally depleted diet

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,200
is now kneeling on par with tobacco as the cause of ill health and premature death. Manufacturers

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,360
use these raw materials instead of good quality fresh food, because enormous subsidies

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,760
mostly paid by Western taxpayers have made them cheap. About 70% of the value of the US

36
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,560
soy of being comes from the US government, no wonder soy of derivatives are found in

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,600
two-thirds of all processed foods. Subsidized US corn is turned into ubiquitous corn

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,080
sweeteners and modified starches for the same reason. The money made from food is shifted

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,720
from those at the bottom of the chain, the farmers and producers. To those at the top, the

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,200
tiny number of big transnational food processors, manufacturers and retailers who control

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,680
our food as never before. Protectionist subsidies have done little to save farmers who are going

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,960
out of business everywhere. The value of agricultural commodities on which so much of the

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,320
developing world depends for its livelihood has slumped. As other barriers to trade have

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,560
been removed, inequalities in wealth have grown. Half the world now stars for lack of food

45
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,240
while the other half suffers from diseases of excess. The money made from these commodities

46
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,840
is concentrated in the hands of the cartels that control trade in them. Just five giant

47
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,920
coffee manufacturers control over half the world's coffee beans. Ten years ago coffee producing

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,920
countries kept 30% of the retail value of the coffee we buy. Today they keep just 10%.

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,960
When we buy a jar of instant coffee, we pay 7,000% more than the farmer got for it.

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,680
These concentrations of power are repeated across the food chain. Some 45% of grain trade is

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,480
controlled by one US company, Cargill. The power of transnational manufacturers is mirrored by

52
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,240
the emergence of dominant food rate retailers. In the near future, just four of five retailers

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,240
will have one global domination with a handful of others dominating regionally. Three quarters of

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,360
grocery sales in the United Kingdom are in the hands of four supermarket groups. They have a

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,600
stranglehold on how our food is made and distributed. They've created a system that is in its use

56
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,880
of new information technology and logistics, both miraculous and impossibly destructive.

57
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,640
Thanks to the barcode, food is flown around the world to meet the supermarkets requirements for

58
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,360
just in time ordering. Their demand for cosmetic perfection and a perpetual global summer

59
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,880
can be met by producers only if they use agrochemicals intensively and allow for a

60
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,480
big fucking word, degree of waste. A third of canyon green beans are thrown away because they are the

61
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,920
wrong size or shape. This new business model has made the supermarkets highly profitable,

62
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,960
but it depends on the extraving it use of that most politically charged and polluting of substances

63
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,440
crude oil for the food miles, for the pesticides, for the packaging that makes up 40% of our domestic

64
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,040
waste. It depends on an endless supply of cheap outsourced labor that can be turned on and off like

65
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,240
a tap. Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers now live in Britain in conditions that would make

66
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,480
Dickens blush. The way we eat is not just ecologically unsustainable, but also morally

67
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,960
and even biologically unsustainable. Making it better requires radical structural change.

68
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,080
It needs tighter competition policies, it needs reform of subsidies and trade rules,

69
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,440
it needs regulation of business none of which government is inclined to do. So making our food

70
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,120
better will also require a massive consumer rebellion. In my experience when people are well-informed

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,720
about how this globalized food is made, they no longer want to eat it, but they have no problem

72
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,760
with well-made cheese. And I'm going to leave it at that for the source code for today.

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:26,640
Tomorrow I surely do hope we have broadband. Bye.
