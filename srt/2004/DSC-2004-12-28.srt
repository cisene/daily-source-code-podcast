Hey everybody how you doing welcome It's your day Lisa for SKoSp

14
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,260
This is where I used the developer's party together and we're closing on the end of the year

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,860
and there's so much inside. So much cool stuff going on. I've got some excellent stuff that I found for you

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,100
of course I didn't find that people sent it to me, but some interesting iPod news today.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,020
I've also got some positive tunes going back to the 60s and I'm sitting here and

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:00,700
curry cottage enjoying my own venti. It's the cappuccino venti. It's straight from the

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:07,260
senseo machine. I love it. They have those in the States. They must have the senseo machine

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,340
a wonderful Dutch invention I believe. I think it was developed by Phillips. Of course

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,060
are mainly known for their light bulbs and not necessarily for their coffee machines, but

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,420
wow you slip a pod in one of those coffee pods or pads. Some people call them pods and

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,700
some people call them pads, but it's perfect. It's exactly what I need for a source code.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,700
As Mr. Non-Smoker. Okay, the end law is left yesterday. I was really sad. I mean these

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,060
these two folks are almost 80 and the airport is really close by so I was no I mean and they

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,300
know how to travel with airplanes and no no problem at all for them to just we had a car

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,980
to come up take them to the airport. They had a like a five hour delay. The airplane that they were

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,180
supposed to go on had technical problems and they just said and the ground staff just left. They just

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,780
left the gate and said sorry you know can't help you right now and then the the big board

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,340
showed later that the flight was canceled. It's totally horrible so they were supposed to be on a

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,260
five fifteen flight. They wound up going on a nine thirty flight and of course it really

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,300
made much sense for them to come all the way back. Only to turn around and go back to the airport

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,260
again. So that was that was sad and fucked up. So they finally got home around midnight. And today

34
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,820
in fact right now it is ten minutes too noon. Christina and I are about to rush off to Heathrow

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,420
to pick up her one of her girlfriends, one of her best friends in the whole world I share,

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:42,140
who is British, who she met at the British School of Amsterdam where they went to school together

37
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,740
for a number of years. I show also has or had or they're still trying to find out a house in

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,540
Thailand right in Puket and so maybe we'll get some more information from her or from her parents.

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,620
Anyway so we're going to pick up the airport she's flying isn't ummy and on a company minor which

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,460
means you got to be literally at the gate to pick her up. So we should be able to fit in 40 minutes

41
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,780
of source code today and the great news came in yesterday after I had already cut the show and was

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,620
in fact on my way to Starbucks to upload it we were parking in the garage and I had the girls with

43
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,580
the Christina and Patricia because they wanted to do some shopping of course all the sales are on right.

44
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,620
After boxing day sales that's what you really want and Bob who was um mom's husband called

45
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,140
and he said we just spoke to the doctor they got the results back because what they do is they you know

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,140
they take this lung out they don't just discard it in the corner you know like oh just throw it

47
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,580
on the tarp over there no they go in the exam and that and yesterday they gave her an official

48
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,180
cancer-free declaration and that calls for a celebration.

49
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,060
A little bit of foundations for you everybody to make you happy

50
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:19,020
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

52
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:33,180

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,740
I love you, you love you, everybody I love you

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,340
I love you, I love you I love you I love you, I love you I love you I love you

55
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,500
Baby, try to find it, baby, it's time

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll make you have it, I'll be home

57
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,460
I'll play beside the phone waiting for you

58
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,660
Why do you kill me up there?

59
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,260
For the company, there's the left me down

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,020
Unless you're on it and where's the phone?

61
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,380
Never come baby, when you see you will

62
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,420
But I love your skin, I need you

63
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,300
I need you, what a nanny one dog

64
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,980
You know that I have from the sky

65
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,940
So kill me up there, but if I don't bring my heart

66
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,140
If you were my type, and I could be the one you were done

67
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,820
And you just let me know

68
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,420
But I'll do you want to, want my track to do you

69
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,580
Why do I need you, what a nanny one dog

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,860
Baby, baby, try to find it, baby

71
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,460
I need you, what a nanny one dog

72
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,500
I'll make you have it, I'll be home

73
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I'll be beside the phone waiting for you

74
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,460
Why do you kill me up there?

75
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,420
For the company, there's the left me down

76
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,260
Unless you're on it and where's the phone?

77
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,980
Unless you're on it and where's the left me down

78
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,700
But I love your skin, I need you, what a nanny one dog

79
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,700
You know that I have from the sky

80
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,860
So kill me up there, but if I don't bring my heart

81
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,700
Take it to the bridge, everybody

82
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,740
I need you, what a nanny one dog

83
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,340
That's probably the shittiest, shittiest encoding I have with that song

84
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,100
And I have it a couple million times

85
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Build me a buttercup foundations

86
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,940
That was from I think 1967, 1968 something like that

87
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,620
This is one of those songs that I'm sure you have if you have a lover of friend

88
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,940
Someone that you share memories of music with together the soundtrack of your lives intersect somewhere

89
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,420
Then you probably have a song that when it comes on the radio

90
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,140
You call that person up and you hold the phone up to the radio

91
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,380
This is one of the songs that Patricia and I always do that with

92
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
If that plays on the radio, she'll call me up immediately and I have a whole voicemail full of

93
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,220
Of times where she called me when I was on airplanes or in tunnels or in meetings and I had the phones switched off

94
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,100
But this is one of those happy songs just makes you even though it was the cruddies

95
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,860
I mean, I'll have to remove this from my from my iTunes library and get a new one because it's just just no good

96
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,860
I've been working with Firefox for the past couple of days. I've been

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,500
Ever since I got OS 10 and I was pretty much one of the first people to switch to OS 10

98
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,820
And I've been going along with the upgrades every single step of the way. I used

99
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,180
Who can be calling me right now, please?

100
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,460
Okay, whatever. I'll talk to that person later

101
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,220
Isn't that cool with GSM phones? I don't know if you do that but when someone calls and I just look at the number and if it's so

102
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,100
Basically this was a number. It wasn't something was in my dress book because I didn't recognize it so it's someone I don't know

103
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
And then

104
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,700
You know, you can just hit you can do two things you can reject the call which sends it directly the voicemail

105
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,540
Which I don't like doing because that pretty much

106
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,060
Gives the call or clue that you rejected them if you know if it doesn't go straight to voicemail because you're phone is off

107
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,740
Bringing one or two times and going to voicemail is a dead giveaway

108
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,060
Which could also be a signal because I do use that with some people and vice versa like okay

109
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,140
He or she is busy they'll call me back. They recognize it was me. They sent it away

110
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,380
What I always do is I hit the silent button. I have it on my Sony Ericsson 700. I

111
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,860
Hit the silent button and so it keeps ringing and goes to voicemail therefore giving the caller who I don't know in this case

112
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,620
No clue that I that I saw the call come in and rejected it. Well, do we use our phones differently than it then we use to or what

113
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,420
Remember the phone was ringing and was a phone's ringing?

114
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,140
You go see now

115
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
This person is

116
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,020
Wow that I'm getting like phone calls on every single fucking device here. What is this?

117
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,940
Uh, okay. Well, I don't know don't have to figure it out later

118
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,900
Right back to Firefox. So um when uh always 10 first came out. I was using internet explorer

119
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Which was bundled pretty quickly. I think and

120
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:24,460
It wasn't long until Safari came out and I immediately started using Safari mainly because it integrated so well with with the macro

121
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:32,060
And I've been hearing a lot about Firefox. I've been reading about it and I finally decided to bite the bullet and to install it

122
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,540
Got to tell you I'm pretty happy. I'm pretty happy with Firefox a couple of

123
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,020
Things that if I just haven't figured out or aren't in there yet

124
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
The most

125
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,220
Obvious is I you know it used to be on Safari if you want to switch between tabs you'd hold down the apple key

126
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,100
And the shift key and then arrow left to right would shift between tabs. That doesn't work anymore

127
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,060
If I want to go all the way page up it used to be apple key and then the up key

128
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
That doesn't work either

129
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,260
You have to use like the control key and you can page up

130
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,140
Or down but not all the way to the top or all the way to the bottom haven't figured that one out yet

131
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,780
I don't use any of the RSS stuff

132
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,660
I understand what they're trying to do like it auto discovers an RSS page and you

133
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,340
Click on it and I just I don't know where to find this shit. I just want to regular aggregator that doesn't really do it for me yet

134
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
That's just interface stuff I guess

135
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Everything else I like

136
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,980
Except for the fact that when I open something in my OPML application

137
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
That calls for a web browser it calls for

138
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:52,460
Explorer and I don't know how to set that to call Safari the cool thing that I did find out though is if you actually want to set a different browser as you default for all other applications

139
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
You do that in the Safari preferences

140
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:02,060
How great is that you so you put you set that up in your current browser is where you set up the preferences to use a different browser

141
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,620
At really slays me in fact. It's probably the same let me see if it's the same with

142
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,700
Not the same with firebox luckily

143
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:17,980
So anyway um liking it a lot and I got an email that apparently the version that I'm using is not the real

144
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,940
G4 or G5 optimized version of Firefox I put a link to it in the show notes for today's podcast

145
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,780
The real Mac Firefox client is still lurking out there and hadn't been released for for some

146
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,220
Some reason which is unclear to me

147
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,780
But I guess that if this is you know this is kind of like the the pre release version

148
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,260
I'm liking it very much. It is definitely faster. It's faster when I'm using it on the modem link

149
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:51,580
Because that's what I still have at home January 4th is when the 4 megabit pipe is supposed to be laid down to the front door and in the front door

150
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,540
I learned a lot about working on slow bandwidth let me tell you and Firefox definitely does quite a good job

151
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,860
There's also all kinds of hacks you can apply you can set it up so that so you can determine how many connections it will open

152
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,940
When it starts rendering after how many seconds of receiving data

153
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,140
And that's the nice stuff about open source you know is that that basically if you don't like the way it performs

154
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,340
You can go in and change it yourself and we'll be talking about that a little bit later in the show because there's some exciting open source news on the way

155
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,580
In fact open source sex coming up in just a second but first George Carlin who we talked about and in fact

156
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,100
I played a whole bit from his audio book yesterday

157
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,300
The auto book titled what is that?

158
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,380
Well, so I'm please bring the pork chops when let me just open up iTunes and get that for you

159
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:48,620
So here I was playing this awesome bit about George Carlin about two hours or maybe three hours after I post the whole show

160
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,540
I get an email saying hey, do you know the George Carlin check it in the rehab?

161
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,540
No, didn't know that brain droppings. That's the title

162
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,100
Is that it? Yeah brain droppings the title of his new book

163
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,660
His audio book which I suggest you got and buy because drunk stone or not the guy makes some excellent points

164
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,940
And I really like what he says, but apparently good old

165
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,820
Good old George Carlin went in to rehab for addiction to

166
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,780
wine and vicaridin a

167
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,660
lovely combination for the Christmas

168
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
You are great

169
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:28,940
Okay, open source sex new podcast if you impaying attention to the iPod or directory which is updating like a motherfucker of these days

170
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,060
I mean now ever since I built the iPod directory scanner

171
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,060
We've just got podcast after podcast being added categories and of course now the people who are maintaining the category nodes are

172
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,500
Waking it up saying hey wait a minute. There's a lot of life in this thing and I'm gonna start scanning and checking for

173
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,940
Activity on the nodes themselves because at the for instance the

174
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,940
The radio node was given back to me by Todd Matham because he at the or at least temporarily

175
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm saving it for him if he wants to take it back

176
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,460
But there's some other nodes that may just not be you know people may not be responsive to the request for links coming in

177
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,460
So I am gonna pay a bit of attention to that

178
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,460
Because now you see that it's really working and if you add something somewhere way down the chain

179
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,700
Say in the indie feeds of the music directory which is being maintained in a whole different country different content from where I am

180
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,420
That will percolate with the iPod or directory scan up to the home page and to the what's new node of the directory

181
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,420
So it does make a lot of sense to to maintain your nodes and keep that going because

182
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:36,140
What have been adding like 10 15 new podcasts the day with the scanner? It's really awesome and I can see that all the other

183
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,980
Directors are benefiting tremendously from this since all that data is available

184
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,780
Just select the XML icon on the iPod or directory pages and then I'll give you the opml file

185
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:53,500
Which is the entire tree? It's all the directories all the data that you can flow right into your into your ipodder

186
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,020
Application or into your outline or god knows what you want to do with it. Be my guest

187
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,620
Violet blue you've probably seen her website or maybe heard of her website called tiny nibbles

188
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,980
dot com finally time for podcast

189
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,420
This is filet blue and you're listening to open source sex

190
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,380
To find out more about me visit my website tiny nibbles dot com or simply google my name

191
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,820
To that I'll be reading the first couple of chapters from the BDSM novel the castle by anti-Morley

192
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,380
And there are a few things you should know about the castle and the other two books of morelies that I'll be reading

193
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,420
They're pretty intense and they deal with some sexual themes that some people might think are a bit too much

194
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,500
No, there's no incess

195
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Yeah, yeah boing boing boing

196
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,460
Are sex with underage people or anything? You okay like that. No, no, there are some intense fantasies acted out here

197
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,140
And while it's perfectly clear at every point that these are consensual fantasies

198
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,860
There is a lot playing into non-consent and yes, there are some pretty convincingly staged

199
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,820
For sex scenarios and some night play if this is not for you skip this podcast and resume listening with the next installment

200
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,780
Okay, so I'm gonna pause this here for a second because clear this whole podcast. It's basically a reading of a

201
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,300
Part of a novel about 30 minutes into the whole podcast

202
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,340
What I'm missing here because I like what what violet blue is doing

203
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,740
I

204
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:23,260
The stories in some cases are total turn on. Oh, um, let's listen to a little bit of the story first and then I'll tell you what I think we need to do with this podcast

205
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:31,340
Before I slept tonight, I would have been taken in every conceivable way. Okay. You understand what I'm saying right? It's not completely safe or work

206
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
What we need is a better quality

207
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:42,940
Recording with violet and I'm willing to help her anyway necessary if we could get a real close mic sound and it doesn't sound so

208
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
You know far off

209
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,860
Distant if we can get a closer mic. It'll be that much more exciting to hear

210
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,620
I'm I'm subscribing to the

211
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,820
Open source sex podcast. I've a feeling that that could be one of the greats because

212
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,460
It really is truly about open source sex and it's you know not

213
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
It's not anything like yeast radio

214
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:15,500
Hello, this has mad winestein once again with another day of yeast radio coming to you live on the

215
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,980
Internet as George Bush would call it. Well, we're not going to talk about her just yet

216
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,140
First we're going to explain why I'm using the

217
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,340
The hand held microphone please do today as opposed to the

218
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,500
As opposed to the lovely of microphone I've been using for the past week or so

219
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,140
The reason is

220
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Lesbians and gentlemen

221
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,380
That's I make it

222
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,020
Another not safe for work podcast clearly nothing to strap on

223
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:57,580
Strap on yeah, okay. Well listen listen to yeast radio because even though Madge winestein is

224
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,420
The most abusive podcast or imaginable when it comes to language

225
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,460
He she makes some incredibly good political points and

226
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:16,140
Social political points and it's something that you need to listen to by yourself and make your own decision

227
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,300
If you ever want us to do it again. I personally enjoyed very much and it's on my

228
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,540
It's on my list of podcast that I subscribe to it's in the iPodder usually these are pretty short 10 15 minutes

229
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,260
So, you know, I like the shorter podcast something you definitely need to check check out

230
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,140
yeast radio you can get to all the podcasts and everything you hear on today's show

231
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,940
Obviously through the production show notes and of course through the iPod or directory

232
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
I was talking about

233
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,740
the delay

234
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,740
That makes me sound like I'm drunk sometimes here actually I'm gonna I'm gonna reset it here for some okay, so now it's been reset

235
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Paul sent me an email about that

236
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
I'm gonna just get Paul's email

237
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
What did he say said

238
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,540
Thing by the problem you have with a slight delay in your headphones while recording your podcast can't be sure

239
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,660
But this sounds like a problem faced by all musicians when recording a life performance directly to a computer called latency

240
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,940
Exactly what it is it is exactly what it is generated by the vast amount of processing the computer has to do to the

241
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,580
Audio data before it reaches your headphones got it and it there is quite a bit, you know, it's going through

242
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,300
Excuse me first of all, it's going into the breakout box which really gives it

243
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,620
the least latency

244
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,700
Imagineable and if I plug my headphone directly into the breakout box it would be great because then I'm getting a direct hard-wired connection

245
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,060
the problem is I won't hear the end mix

246
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,380
Which includes the processing so I run the microphone through the

247
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,540
Monomizer through the dynamics compressor through the ten band EQ and through a little bit of reverb

248
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,660
I would miss all that so when you're doing radio or when you're doing a podcast and you do it the way I do it

249
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,740
Which is as performance art in real time we're cutting it straight to a straight to the disk and and I'm not

250
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,700
You know going back and putting songs in and putting bits in and editing out stuff you don't like

251
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,500
You really need everything at your fingertips and you need to be able to hear exactly what the listener is hearing

252
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,940
Which is why in fact

253
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,740
It became a real big problem when digital broadcast came around a via satellite back in the old days back in the old days kids

254
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,420
When we have basically the antenna on the roof

255
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:35,900
You know we'd be playing records with needles on vinyl you just listen you know we'd have a little like a just a regular old

256
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,620
tuner

257
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:47,180
Amplifier set up that you might find in any any living room and we plug the headphones into that that because then you'd have or that would be the total air signal

258
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,380
You'd listen to of course you want to be able to pre-fade or listen listen to you know cue stuff up outside of the broadcast

259
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,660
But you wanted to hear exactly what people at home were hearing which is what everyone tries to do

260
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,380
I mean

261
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,020
Have you ever been to a recording studio or maybe you've seen this they have the few manga speakers

262
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,500
But then usually on the console there these little what we call reference speakers little square boxes not cheap by the way, but

263
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,700
Some actually have extremely cheap ones and the reason why is they'll do the mix the way they want to hear it in the studio

264
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,780
That's cranking and pounding and whatever they're looking for but then they're gonna listen to it

265
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,660
Does it listen and to see what it's gonna sound like at home at on someone's portable radio in the car

266
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,780
Which of course is you know that reference is changing every single day

267
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,100
But that's what people do in the in the professional audio industry and that's what I want as well

268
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,420
So I want to hear everything and I want to hear the mix

269
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,180
So when I when I'm mixing and music this is the problem another problem because that mix is only coming through the total signal

270
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,820
I'm not going back into the breakout box where I would then supposedly plug my headphone into

271
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,020
So it just doesn't work if you want to do it in in the fashion that I'm doing it in without

272
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,700
Without eventually getting some delay and to delay it builds up over time

273
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,020
It's like there's some some buffer or some cash or something that's not being flushed out

274
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,860
Often enough because if I basically if I un-high jack

275
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,140
The breakout box that have my mic plugged into that everything runs through and I high jack

276
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,740
Again, which is what I just did a couple minutes ago

277
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,820
Then it's good for at least another five or ten minutes before it starts to slow down and actually

278
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,100
It usually happens when I start pumping other audio around when the when the slow down starts to build up

279
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,340
So there's

280
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:37,100
There's not really a solution other than to create a complete external mix and use external boxes and I don't think that's necessary

281
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
I think it's just a matter of working with

282
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Working with developers

283
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,980
Who make this stuff and I and I think that the audio hijack pro guys

284
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,860
I got to talk to them because they're they are coming very very close to the stuff that I think works for for creating

285
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Podcasts and if we could integrate just a couple of a couple of things and change a couple of bits with the interface

286
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,540
I think we'd actually

287
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,420
Be somewhere very very close to fucking awesome

288
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,820
Hey, you know that Don and Drew and and Pete of course

289
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,700
Raster web all live in Wisconsin

290
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,460
Renek oops, did you hear that that was weird? Let me recapture hold on

291
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,500
Okay, I ran across a podcast that had some wacky news from Wisconsin

292
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,860
Don't listen to the best of distorted you daily

293
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:35,500
Let's get into the news of the weird right now first things first this happened picture this if you will a man in Wisconsin

294
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,380
Was doing his laundry at a laundry mat when he thought I'll just do my clothes that I'm wearing too

295
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,380
So he gets bug naked buck ass naked

296
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,100
There are other people no there are other people in the laundry mat, right?

297
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,820
So he puts all of his clothes in the washer. He's naked. Uh, well women

298
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,740
Started laughing at him apparently he had a small penis

299
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,300
They were the women started laughing at him. He gets mad and he storms off

300
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,460
The police described the man as being six foot three inches

301
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,620
Six foot three inches, no, I'm not saying that the three inches was how big his penis was although it could have been

302
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,860
He did have a small penis with he did have a muscular build though

303
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,340
May have been wearing a baseball cap, so if anyone in the Wisconsin area sees a naked man running around with a baseball cap in a small cock

304
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Call the laundry mat until then where you saw the man because his laundry is just sitting there waiting for him to pick it up

305
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
I just love that

306
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,020
Okay, so in Wisconsin news for everybody a couple of things I wanted to run through

307
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,020
I got an email from Mike Corley all of a sudden. I see all these

308
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Websites pointing to this great

309
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:52,940
Fantastic new invention called parachutes for private airplanes and I want to talk about that for a second because mainly the

310
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,220
There's a private aircraft manufacturer that makes this serious S a C I R I S and

311
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:05,260
And I and there's links in the show notes to videos of this particular aircraft basically

312
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,860
Ballistic research is a company that came up with a 16 or 17,000 dollar parachute system with rockets

313
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,900
So if the concept is is if you run into trouble with your airplane

314
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,140
You pull this lever. I need like 30 pounds of of power to you know pull this lever and then

315
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:28,140
Rockets shoot out the top of your airplane. We're talking like you know like a S S no 172 size airplane

316
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,660
So a four four-seater airplane right and it blows out the top or just you know rips through the canopy whatever

317
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:43,020
Basically rendering your airplane pretty fucked up, but then it deploys a parachute that lets you float down to earth

318
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,980
Couple things about this first of all this is not new this has been around for quite a while the

319
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:54,860
Serious aircraft has been sold with this as an option at least for a year. I think so you know why people are catching on to it now

320
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,340
But also what it is it's a bad idea because it gives you a false sense of security

321
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,060
I don't know if you've ever done a parachute jump. I haven't but I can tell you one thing

322
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,940
It's not like you you don't land like a frickin feather, okay? And there's a reason why all the

323
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:17,020
Demonstration videos are done over the Bahávei desert and not over like a populated area or water or whatever

324
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,780
Because you're gonna come down pretty damn hard your plane you will probably live

325
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,020
Because the seats that you're in can take 30 gs worth of impact so that's gravitational force impact

326
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,700
So you probably will hurt your back, but won't break it, but your aircraft's gonna be destroyed and that's only if you don't land

327
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,980
somewhere where there's other people buildings power lines highways freeways whatever

328
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,980
it also I think it makes for bad pilots because

329
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,780
There would be very few situations other than a fucking wing coming off in a goddamn spiral

330
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:54,140
Which may not be able to you know be a situation where you can deploy your parachute anyway

331
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,100
I would rather try and land the aircraft that makes a hell of a lot more sense to me

332
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,700
And there was all kinds of limitations, but it's really it's just I think it creates bad pilots like

333
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,220
Oh, you know if I get I forget into a situation that I can't handle add snow problems

334
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,180
I've always got my backup parachute that is not the way to go

335
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,340
Anyway, a lot of people talking about the parachutes and I think it makes

336
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,780
It's just making people feel safer and if $16,000 will make you feel safer

337
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:29,420
Then that could be worth it to you or to someone who's flying you, but I'm not a big believer in this in the airplane parachutes

338
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,260
And no they're not gonna be installed on 747s, you know

339
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:41,020
Maybe we should do a little bit more to control alcohol in regular traffic and we'll say more lies than these freaking parachutes

340
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,900
And I'd love for any aviators to weigh in with the audio comments and feedback

341
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:53,100
Adam and curry dot com time for some music mashups big thing of the day got an email from Niels

342
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,580
I think Niels is from Holland this need look I got a lot of mashup people from

343
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,860
From Holland maybe Niels isn't from Holland. Not sure anyway. He did a live mashup

344
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,740
Which he says it's it's live with errors and all they want to play for you today because a couple songs all strung together

345
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,100
You're gonna dig it. It's the mpm rock mashup here on your daily source code

346
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:49,580
I'm so happy because today I found my friends

347
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:55,180
I'm so ugly that's okay

348
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:49,580
I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I

349
00:29:49,580 --> 00:30:14,260
I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm so happy that I'm out

350
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,260
Back to where you want to go

351
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,260
Back to where you want to go

352
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,260

354
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
They were standing

355
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260

Cowbell.

386
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,300
Yes boy, one.

387
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,600
I got him hib.

388
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:09,720
He only presents him.

389
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,120
The only person you hit is Martin Capber

390
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,140
He really really really domu

391
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:41,140
It's a big space.

392
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:46,140
Cowbell.

393
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Doesn't work in the wood.

394
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,140
I gotta have more cowbell.

395
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,140
Cowbell.

396
00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Cowbell.

397
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Cowbell.

398
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Cowbell.

399
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Cowbell.

400
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,140
Cowbell.

401
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Cowbell.

402
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Cowbell.

403
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Space, space, space.

404
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Excellent.

405
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,140
Excellent.

406
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:19,140
That's the big mystery of the sample rate on the daily source code.

407
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:29,140
That's the sample rate of the mp3.
