1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm counting casting with Adam Curry.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The power of the Lord is coming.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Howdy.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thursday, November 11th, 2004,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
coming to you from Curry Castle and Flanches Belgium.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Flanches.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And to the Belgium.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's your daily source code.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm Adam Curry here in the barn.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Studio in the complex.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The power of the Lord is coming.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, how you doing everybody?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, in kind of a stay at home day,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Christina didn't have to go to school.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What was the deal for Christina?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How come we didn't have to go to school today?

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Back at the school.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Back at the school.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, it's a Belgian holiday.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And so, the international school has a holiday.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even though it's a Belgian holiday.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Really.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How many Belgian teachers work at the international school?

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Huh?

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Another teacher.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, what is Vapa Stilston?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What is that about?

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's that holiday about?

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The end of the war.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Something about the end of the second world.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The first world war is not it.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I think it's the first world war.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You got to stay home.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
As long as you got to stay home, right?

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, howdy.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Y'all.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is the source code.

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Patricia is in Amsterdam.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She's working with Movers over the next two days.

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Getting stuff packed up there.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now, at the same time, on Monday, moving into the bunker in Amsterdam is the Dutch version of the apprentice,

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the Trump reality show.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or, I should say, it's not really the Dutch version because they pretty much just stole the format and of twisted around

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that it's kind of the same thing.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Only don't have to pay any format rights.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, a famous lawyer named, but on Moscow, he will be the guy that needs to eventually have an apprentice to replace him.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And he's actually a pretty funny guy.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's a kind of like a celebrity lawyer.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He does a lot of high profile cases.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He's been doing more and more.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Really showbiz, like celebrity related stuff recently.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Which is okay.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, it's the courts.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's all show business.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, there'll be, I think, to start off with 10 candidates, that gets little down to eight pretty quickly,

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
who will all be living at the bunker, working at the bunker, and trying to get that coveted spot of being the next,

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Brom Moskovitz, entertainment lawyer at large.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, that will last for about three and a half months.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, you know, also, we have to get all this stuff moving in and out.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm really happy about that because, you know, you make a killing on renting out the TV production, believe me.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And on Monday, the movers come here.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We're there also packing Tuesday, then Wednesday, Patricia's in England, getting all the stuff set,

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
then on Thursday, Christina's when you and I go over, so we have to stay in the castle.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All there's going to be is one bed here.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
One bed.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How about a TV?

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do we get to keep one TV set?

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Or we just keep the internet connection.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And we just laptop it.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, let me guess a good shot at DVD.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The one that I picked up for you with Don and Drew.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tomorrow, which is Friday, the BBC are dropping by to see the frickin' mess that this place is.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They insisted they wanted to see how a podcast is made.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, they're going to get it.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's for sure.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Everything around me is pretty much boxes and stuff is piled up highs.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I've been keeping up to speed on that.

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And the name of this BBC show, it's BBC 2 television,

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
is the culture show.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Tonight, actually, is the first episode.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's coming on.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think it's on right now.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But there seem to be archives of it coming up on the BBC TV 2 website.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
BBC 2 website.

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So hopefully we can watch that over the internet as well.

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I guess they just want to know what podcasting is about more or less.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I got a mouse finger.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Or just a trackpad finger.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, they talked about having iPod or ears.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And actually, I'm now wearing Altic Lansing headset, which is...

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's a real bitch to put on.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's kind of a plastic headset with the headphone parts.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Kind of...

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I guess you're...

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You kind of hang them on your...

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A little bit half on your ears.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then there's the plastic bar that goes through the back of the head.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So it's kind of like a foldable headset that you really don't put on the top of your head.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But more in the back here in the neck.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It takes a while to figure out how to put it on.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then it may still be just wearing it some foolish feedback words away.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But it seems to work and the quality is good.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The sound level is also good.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And there's nothing sticking in my ear because

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I said it's kind of irritated from having all these...

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
These ear buds stuck in them for hours on end recording and listening to podcasts.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And now my finger...

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
...that I use the Mac power book to record everything with.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I use it for everything.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I've been mousing so much on a track pad lately that now my index finger my right hand hurts.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And whatever I need to exert any power with it.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So there's this...

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What is this?

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There's a Bluetooth mouse that I got, which is pretty awesome.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And just click it once and it kind of hooks up to the power book.

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And then you can take over all track commands with this Bluetooth mouse.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What's nice about it is it has a right click and a left click.

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's a two button mouse and it has a scroll wheel on top,

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
which is something sorely missing from most Mac mice these days.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So I've been using that to alleviate the mouse finger.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Getting back here in Holland.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Situation post-dalephone hospital murder is not good, my friends.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Free speech is under attack.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
People are burning up each other's churches, mosques, schools.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Now in the media it may come across a little bit bigger than it all actually is.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But there are actually schools being burnt down.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And people are lighting fire to churches and mosques.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everyone's trying to calm the situation down.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Politicians are freaking out.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's crazy is that there's two politicians who have also been quite vocal about muslim culture

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and integration into the Dutch culture.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
One of the Mackehid builders.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And the other one is Ion here she is,

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
who actually made that movie with Teo von Hoch.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The movie that probably ultimately was one of the direct reasons

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that he was assassinated, murdered, brutally.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Not that that should be any reason whatsoever for any type of art or free expression.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But all the papers now and I don't understand how you can do this.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you're in a governmental leading role,

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
sure you should have all the protection you need and you should get all kinds of protection

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and it should be known that you have protection.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And you should have really amazingly good personal security and protection.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But what they do here is they say, well, you know,

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
well, the literal word is umlahtoku,

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
which means they've dived under or they're in hiding.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So they're saying that, oh, I'm hiding and I wake up one morning in this house

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and I have lunch at a different place and I go to bed in that place

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and I haven't seen my home in two weeks.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm like, what the hell is that?

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I mean, how bad is the situation that these politicians are actually going into hiding?

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That makes no sense to me as a leadership role to say,

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
we're in hiding, that seems like chicken shit.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So it's not good.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And the media, of course, is flipping out on this.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They love it.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They have some fear to play on and they're using everything they can.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And everyone's jumping in.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's like a big, you know, pile jump of people trying to calm down the nation

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and get stuff, you know,

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
people just going for whatever they can.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's really, it's kind of nasty.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And everyone's confused and people are frightened.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I'd have to say the thing that you hear the most now is folks saying,

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
well, you know, we think we're just going to leave the country.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And, you know, was it like 20, 30,000 people ready to go at this moment?

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So it's not good.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And of course, this all just coincidentally coincides with our leaving,

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
moving to the UK next week.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That wasn't planned, but boy, I'm not sorry about it.

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not sorry about it right now.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How about you, Christina?

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How do you feel about leaving right now?

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey, you don't want to go?

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why not?

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You want to stay at school?

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You'd like all your friends at school?

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, that sucks.

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Two months ago, it was no problem.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, I knew it to myself.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, we needed a question, did.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What about your health?

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, you didn't know the kids at school?

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, you're going to meet new kids from new lands.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You sound really enthusiastic.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What are you on your MSN?

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Alrighty.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, onto a couple of podcasts, then.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Some stuff that I've picked up and stuff that I want to share.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We also got some music to play.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Actually, a couple of songs that are all non-R-I-A-A music for you on the daily source code.

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There's a new, or there actually has been a note in the podcast directory entitled Religion.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And there's been more podcasts coming out.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And that note of the iPod.org directory is growing quite slowly.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And just going to play a little bit of a new, what I call a Godcast, a God podcast that came in.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Not so much is to listen to the message.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But I'm always happy when religious broadcasts are show up.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Because if there's one thing those guys know, it's how to make money.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not begins, begins kind of a journey for us as a church.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
As we're going to begin to kind of explore what community is through the voices of our community.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And in preparation for this, I wrote a little something here.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It says that there's no need.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know if they're actively soliciting donations.

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But they're not about four or five different religious broadcasts.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And that's a really good thing.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You know, this is a great avenue, a great outlet for people to share their church sermons,

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
or temple gatherings, or whatever it is.

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's totally appropriate.

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And yes, indeed.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can also probably do quite well at getting some real donations.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And thank we encourage that, too.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was perusing through my latest subscriptions.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And all the shows that I am subscribed to with my iPod.

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, I listened to a lot of podcasts that come through an audio.weblogs.com, which is

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
a really great place to sample them.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I'm subscribed to the show Coverville.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Have been ever since the Abba Coverville show, which just totally killed me.

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And today, there was a referral to the Daily Source Code in Coverville.

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And that was about the David Bowie story that Patricia told.

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
By the way, still to come as she's not here tonight, but hopefully tomorrow night Patricia

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
will tell the Stevie Nick story.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don of Don Andrew has been bugging me to get her to tell this.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a short story and it's just gross.

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So, you know, I know you're all going to love it.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But right now, here that little bit and actually a song that goes along with it from a coverville

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
from the episode from two days ago.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm going to go ahead and get to a song that kind of got inspired to play here by.

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Wow, I guess it's Adam Curry again.

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm going to mention him a couple of times on my show.

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But his wife apparently had a trist with David Bowie around the time that space oddity

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
was becoming popular.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So I decided, well, I'll dig up a cover version of space oddity.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So here it is. Enjoy.

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Come on.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Come on.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Come on.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come on.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Come on.

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Start the mission and make us look new.

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on.

265
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Come on.

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Come on.

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Come on.

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Come on.

269
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Come on.

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Come on.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Come on.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come, Come on.

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Come on, come on.

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Come on.

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Come on.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Come on.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Come on.

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on.

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Come on.

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come on.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Come on.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Come on.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
Come on.

284
00:13:49,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Where am I sitting in a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent

285
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:49,200
and going to get a tent and going to get a tent and going to get a tent

286
00:14:49,200 --> 00:15:19,200

288
00:15:49,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Coming to you via satellite, it's Coverville, featuring space audity there performed by

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,520
the Flying Pickets, a former kind of a theater troupe out of London back in the 80s

290
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:22,080
that had Occupella and one of their productions, and during the show, realized that they

291
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,920
enjoyed doing the Occupella a lot more than doing the theater group.

292
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,080
Okay, there you go, courtesy of Coverville, podcast, you should check out, actually a podcast

293
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:37,280
which I've made a part of what I'm just calling the pod squad, and people asked me

294
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,720
all the time, particularly journalists asked me, you know, so what do you listen to?

295
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,880
Can you mention some other podcasts, and of course I send them off to the directorie,

296
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,480
I send them off to audio.weblogs.com to check out stuff there.

297
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,920
So finally, I've just gotten so tired of people asking me the same question over and over again.

298
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,960
I put together a list, and I link to it today from iPod.org, so you can find it there.

299
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,040
And it's basically just, well, what it really is, the underlying files and OPML file, I actually

300
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,240
link to it in the posting of RSS feeds that I'm currently subscribed to, I took a couple

301
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,280
out that, you know, that I don't want you to know that I subscribe to.

302
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,720
But the other ones are just kind of the things that I definitely always have streaming into

303
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
my iPod.

304
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,200
So you can check that out, and what actually, what I'm hoping that some of the iPod or folks

305
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,200
might look at is since this is also an OPML file, it's kind of like a reading list,

306
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,520
so maybe you could compare it to programming, like a network, or maybe this is my personal

307
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
station or something, I don't know.

308
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,920
But what would be cool is if you could drag that OPML file into iPod or have it subscribed

309
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:58,600
to all of those programs and, you know, give you an option, you know, subscribe to all

310
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,520
of them or make them all as one feed so that there's only basically one channel, so

311
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,760
it would be, you know, in this case, it would be the pod squad and anything that's new

312
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,360
on the pod squad would come into one playlist.

313
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,960
The most important thing, of course, is if you take that whole OPML file out, is then

314
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,280
it needs to unsubscribe and all of those different feeds.

315
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,320
So anyway, just some stuff to work with, and I gotta tell you, I've been so swamped with

316
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
doing stuff here.

317
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,040
Got the contracts finally sorted out by the way for the UK House and what we transferred

318
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:35,480
to our down payments and everything seems to be on track if banking traffic will hopefully

319
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,160
get money from 0.8 a.m. be in time.

320
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,760
Anyway, what was I saying, yeah, because of all the, all the, just all the craziness around

321
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,040
here, I haven't really had time to check out the iPod or developers list, I've got to

322
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
dive back into that.

323
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Hopefully this weekend, after I take care of filling up a couple of boxes with stuff that

324
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,320
were definitely not taking with us.

325
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,800
Remember the George Carlin stuff piece?

326
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,840
Well, you know, that's what I'm doing, trying to cut down on all the stuff.

327
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:11,680
A podcast that I, that is also, by the way, on my pod squad list, is Aldo Castineda.

328
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,120
He presented himself pretty early on in the podcasting days, looking and do some stuff

329
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
with the, actually, he was immediately looking for business models and trying to figure out

330
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
how to get some money flowing through these podcasts.

331
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,480
And he has his own podcast called the Biter 2 of Business News.

332
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,080
It's really interesting because, well, the whole thing is actually, I'll play the intro

333
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
to it.

334
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,840
It's kind of soft, but I'll shut up in a minute and you can hear it.

335
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
It's a format and it's very short.

336
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,200
It's based on Julia Child, actually, so listen to just a bit here, but Biter 2 of Business

337
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
News.

338
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Well, I was great.

339
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Do it yourself, first.

340
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,240
So I have a whole chicken carcass here, and I'm just gonna whack it up with my fever, and

341
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,360
I have a pumice rubber hammer, and that makes it what she's doing to do things.

342
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,920
This is a Megabyte or two of Business Legal and Financial News, served in one or two minute

343
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:13,000
bite-sized chunks inspired by Julia Child, welcome to my kitchen.

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Super fast, a Biter 2 of Business Legal and Financial News.

345
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm the guy who manages the law finance and Business Sections on iPodder.org.

346
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,800
So I just wanted to update everybody to two new entries in the law category.

347
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,920
The first is a weekly policy update from the Center for Democracy and Technology.

348
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,640
That'll be listed under law, and then the other one is WLF, Williams Law Firm, WebLug,

349
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,360
of legal news and observations, including a quote, the day and daily updates.

350
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,920
Both of them, I think, well, actually know the Center for Technology and Democracy is quite

351
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,400
a long podcast.

352
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:58,160
It's the audio section from a video rolling, they do weekly and put on by one of their analysts.

353
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,040
The way you hear here is Aldo, who is clearly maintaining a node in the directory, talking

354
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,560
a little bit about the new shows that are coming in on the business front there.

355
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,560
So make sure you subscribe to his podcast, always bringing you the latest stuff in the

356
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
business news.

357
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,480
That's kind of the way we got it.

358
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,240
I guess kind of got to work together to figure out what you want to listen to and what, you

359
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,120
know, how are you going to fit all these great shows into your day, right?

360
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,760
You've got to find some guide.

361
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
So check out Aldo if you're looking for business stuff.

362
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,920
Palisine and leader, if that has died or he is not a liver failure, a mysterious blood disease

363
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,840
or a poisoning plot, like Schrodinger's cat, he may be half dead and have a live while

364
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
crying.

365
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,440
Visitors fighting to take his place, connive, flora the voters who backed carry off seeking

366
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
therapy.

367
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,400
Deepest notice, because they're wary and staring at walls when there's nothing to see.

368
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,240
It's called post-delections, election, trauma, sufferers want to move to Canada or back

369
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,240
home with mama and the Scott Kiererson.

370
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
Hold on a second.

371
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
You noticed that there's no tap dancing.

372
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,080
Sounds like she didn't realize that her tap dance shoes were either not on or maybe

373
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,600
the track wasn't recording.

374
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
Well, I'll just try and help out there.

375
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Priority, no durer or has been dismissed for doing research on her own.

376
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,080
If she was holding out for Nagyoti, there would be a fewer or Scott gets the chair and

377
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,880
Derek also screaming as well.

378
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,240
This bulletin, just in era, that's condition is worse.

379
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,360
He's in a coma or he's speaking or heading for Palisine in a verse.

380
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,480
That biggest news since Osama and Lawrence voters took up for books and provided the

381
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,720
post that turns Republicans from the losers and the voters stay tuned for like breaking

382
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:53,840
up to that tap dance and podcasting news.

383
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,600
All right, little help from your friends and you'll get by, right?

384
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,000
So coming through on openpodcast.org, haven't been able to get the tap dance and podcast

385
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,080
news, their own feed yet, but working on it, my friends, working on it.

386
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
Now time for some ass knocking on the daily source code.

387
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:19,520
If you know the words feel free to sing along, please buy all means.

388
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,720
Bob Schneider, this feels good right here, this is nice.

389
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,720
All right, let's do this now, people, let's do it, here we go.

390
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,480
Let's party like some better cake, don't drop it to ground, like it's no good thing.

391
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,920
Bob, this is something like a sack of a pair, pretty little peery night, it's actually

392
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
a new fan.

393
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,680
But the match is a good match, it's a new vibe, but the people come back up pretty, blue,

394
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,520
I got to teach the world to sing the song, so we can now get together now and get the

395
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
bow.

396
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,480
Let's shake it together now.

397
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,400
I wanna do this by this mama, fucking wrong now, yeah, this time to crack it down, yeah.

398
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,760
And it's not a team can't move on, it's not a problem with the goodies together now.

399
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,280
I wanna do this by this mama, fucking wrong now, yeah, this time to crack it down, yeah.

400
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,200
And it's not a team can't move on, it's not a problem.

401
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,920
You can't even come, go, you're not because they're not all too bad, it's not too much.

402
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,480
But I'm still getting play, max relaxing the booty group, do all the crazy for this shit,

403
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm supposed to do it, I got nothing else, that was a ton of men,

404
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,600
while I took care of all the fans when I was a little kid.

405
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,640
People coming up and asking me how to go up against the land like you got to be such a bad motherfucker,

406
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,400
moment in my sea, I said, show me shit, it just came naturally, yeah, yeah.

407
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:52,240
It's just you guys, here we go, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one,

408
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,480
three, let me in.

409
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,420
I'll go with the goodies together,

410
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,860
cut down, let's do this by this mama, to go round and round,

411
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,860
Man, stop to a crackdown!

412
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,460
Yeah, so I can't even count on one stop

413
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,660
But we're with the goodies and get it all

414
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,660
I'm snare, live, morons, canals

415
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,460
From November 6th, as knocking

416
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,860
On your day in the source code

417
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,860
Hope you sang along there on that audience participation bit

418
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Ooh, nice awesome fade there on that MP3

419
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,860
But it's cool, you know, there's a lot of this stuff flowing into

420
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,860
My iTunes, I guess a lot of from the blog digger media feeds on it from the indie feeds that are out there

421
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:59,860
And also part of my personal pod squad is always the Koma 1000 news updates

422
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,860
And once again, our consumer guy, her wise mom is coming to you at the rescue to your rescue

423
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,860
If you're looking for anything electronics for the Christmas shopping season

424
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,860
The marketplace is flooded with electronics

425
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,860
In fact, these days there aren't too many places where you can't buy electronic products

426
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
I mean Walmart is selling plasma TVs

427
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
So where's the best place to shop for electronics?

428
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
It all depends on what you want

429
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
Price, service, or selection

430
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,860
That's the conclusion of a just release survey by consumer reports

431
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,860
The magazines Amanda Walker says they pulled more than 10,000 readers

432
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,860
And found that no brick and mortar store earned top marks across the board

433
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,860
No matter where they went, they really couldn't get that trifecta

434
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,860
The best service, the best price and the best selection at one spot

435
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,860
The consumer reports survey shows the best prices can be found at amazon.com

436
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
And Costco

437
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,860
4 selection and service at a big retailer

438
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Ritz cameras and circuit city came out on top

439
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,860
For best service, including the fastest checkout

440
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Consumer reports readers chose Ritz camera and radio shack

441
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,860
By the way, the number one complaint of those surveyed was

442
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,860
I can't find anyone to answer my questions

443
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,860
A complaint most common when shopping for electronics at price club stores

444
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm her wife's mom, the consumer man

445
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,860
Looking out for you on comal 1000 news

446
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
Excellent, thank you very much

447
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,860
Her radio shack, I told you that's the blogger's store

448
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Man, that's where people still help you

449
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
What's this slogan?

450
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
You got questions?

451
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
We've got answers?

452
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,860
My daddy, my now making an announcement

453
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Hi, this is Dan class

454
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Former comedian actor, stay at home dad, shut in

455
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,860
And when I'm not changing my daughter's poopy butt

456
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
Or checking out the babes at the PTA

457
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,860
I like to do a little podcast that I call

458
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
The bitterest pill

459
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Here's a little taste of the latest dose

460
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,860
Alright, here comes the promo of your balda

461
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,860
My first, when I first moved out here

462
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,860
I got a job as a production assistant for David Chase

463
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
You know who that is?

464
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,860
He was working on a show that I didn't like very much

465
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
That he created that

466
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
And I kind of wrote the guy off

467
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Like, oh, this show is his boring and son

468
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,860
And I wanted to be acting and I was really bitter

469
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,860
I hated the actors because I wanted to be one of them

470
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
You know what I mean?

471
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
I had a very bad attitude

472
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,860
David Chase of course, the guy that I thought

473
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Made a tea bad TV show, turned out to eventually

474
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Create and produce a show called The Supranos

475
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
I don't know if you've heard of it

476
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,860
It's on HBO, it's brilliant

477
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,860
It's awesome, every episode is genius

478
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,860
So that's how good a judge of character

479
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
I've been in the past but when I was doing that

480
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
I had to run on these errands

481
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,860
And one day I was in a pharmacy just outside of Beverly Hills

482
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,860
On Sunset Boulevard

483
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Picking up something or I don't know why

484
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
I don't even remember why I was there

485
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,860
But I realized that Louis Anderson is in there

486
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Who was the big, large guy who eventually

487
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Would host the family feud

488
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
But he was really big comic at the time

489
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
He was really famous

490
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Oh my god, my first celebrity sighting

491
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
It's Louis Anderson

492
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,860
And I realized that Rod Stewart is in there too

493
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,860
Oh my god, this is the greatest Rod Stewart

494
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,860
And Louis Anderson in the same celebrity sighting

495
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Okay, this is getting really good

496
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
And I tell you, you've got to listen to this

497
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
You've got to subscribe to this podcast

498
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
This is awesome

499
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,860
So you're ready, you got Louis Anderson and Rod Stewart

500
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
In the store, what's going to happen next

501
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
Well, I'm not going to spoil that here it comes

502
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
And then I realize

503
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Louis Anderson is staring at Rod Stewart's ass

504
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Just staring at it

505
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,860
But he is never stared at an ass before

506
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
It was awesome

507
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
And then about three weeks later

508
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
I was on a lot of Universal

509
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Which is where I was working Universal Studios

510
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,860
And I was coming out of an elevator

511
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
And Tracy Lords was going in the...

512
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
Okay, you're really going to listen to the podcast

513
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,860
To check that out

514
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
What were you saying Christina?

515
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
I have to wait to watch a new video

516
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
From the show, it says

517
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860
From the footage on there

518
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
How long you show on that side?

519
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
Because you can't watch it

520
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Because I'm recording, is that why?

521
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
What do you have it cut out?

522
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Do you have it ready to go?

523
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Yeah

524
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Well, let me come over there and check it out for a second

525
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Hold on

526
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Let me see what you got going

527
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Hmm

528
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
Hold on, I'll just turn this off

529
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
I'll just keep this recording

530
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Just for one second

531
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
Okay, let's see what you got

532
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
There's just a little short little thing

533
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
What is this?

534
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
From their side, see it starting

535
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Okay, so it's a piece of video

536
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
From Halloween

537
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Okay, play it

538
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
See what it is

539
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
They made it really scary

540
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
It's pretty warm

541
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
What?

542
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,860
It's pretty warm

543
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
But I gotta stay shut up

544
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
It's always nice

545
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
Is this their track?

546
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
No, they're really impolving

547
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
This is basically what I'm going to be in this side

548
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
This is just going to be for real

549
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
A home movie

550
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
No, it's just going to be too far

551
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
It's just going to be too far

552
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,860
It's just going to be too far

553
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
It's Halloween

554
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
So they made this themselves

555
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,860
With the Halloween is the only normal day of the year

556
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
For me

557
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
I got it, cool

558
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
All right, so

559
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,860
This christina's favorite band Good Charlotte

560
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,860
They seem to be putting together some pretty cool videos

561
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
From the road

562
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
With just journalists that guy who makes all their videos

563
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Cool

564
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,860

That might as well make it happen

She's all the flavours that I like to taste

As you watch it, it's in any way

607

The name of the band title the song is Shee

623
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Are you going to let the dog out?

624

Sorry

625
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Please, yeah

626
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,860
Don't let all your eyes

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Okay

628
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
See, this is what happened

629
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,860
Mom's away, mom's staying at the bunker in Amsterdam

630
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm in charge and what do I get?

631
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
No cooperation

632
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Zero

633
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
I don't even get anything

634
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
No love, I get no love

635
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
Okay

636
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
There you go

637
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
That's how this is going out

638
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Everyone's hearing it, you're giving your dad no love

639
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,860
Give a second to the silencer

640
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
The little brook died

641
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Who's that?

642
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,860
I've never thought about the little brook

643
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
I don't know my friend's name

644
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
My wife's to come over here and tell the story

645
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
But this was in

646
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
So that's in Belgium

647
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Really?

648
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
How old was she?

649
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
She was kidnapped

650
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
How long were this happened

651
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
I didn't hear about it on the news

652
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
I didn't see anything about that

653
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,860
There's so a local thing

654
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
Not many people there actually

655
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Shit

656
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,860
People never said no

657
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
They were changing things like

658
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Rest in peace at older ones

659
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,860
Yeah

660
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
That's horrible

661
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
It's a name that's old in there

662
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,860
What are you going?

663
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
Colleship

664
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Okay

665
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
I'm going to finish up the show

666
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,860
I got two more things

667
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
What's that?

668
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
I'm going to go rock in the room

669
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,860
Well that's what's 14 year olds are supposed to do

670
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,860
You're supposed to go rock in your room

671
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Okay

672
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Close the door

673
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Thank you very much

674
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,860
Let's say hi to an old buddy

00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860

00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
And I had a blast at blogger con

681
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,860
Sounds like you did as well

682
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
You know I really enjoyed the opportunity

683
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
You and I and Steve Gilmore and some others got

684
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,860
To just have a really good conversation

685
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,860
Over drinks on Friday night

686
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,860
Trader Vicks was a lot of fun

687
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
I did want to let you know

688
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,860
I think this is the first of its kind

689
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,860
But I've been asked to do a podcasting 101 presentation

690
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
At this coming weekends

691
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Southern California Mac fair

692
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
There's a once a year fair they hold

693
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,860
And I'm actually presenting both Saturday and Sunday

694
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,860
Just spreading the podcasting word so to speak

695
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
After talking with promoter

696
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
He's rearranged the schedule

697
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
And he has us in the main auditorium

698
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Right in the middle of the day

699
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
Both days so we'll have great turnout

700
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,860
We're going to go over everything

701
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
From what podcasting is for the uninitiated

702
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,860
All the way through how to do it

703
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Package it and podcast it out to the world

704
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,860
So I'm sending this to you just hopefully you've got some listeners

705
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
In the Southern California area that are just sitting on the fence

706
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
Not quite ready to pull the trigger

707
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
And I'd like to suggest they come on by

708
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,860
I never know where my next favorite podcast is going to come from

709
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,860
And hopefully it'll be somebody in the audience

710
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
This is coming weekend

711
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,860
So just trying to get some more podcasters in the coming weeks

712
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,860
You know the best part is the promoter called me the other day

713
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
And one is to know if it would be all right if I had somebody

714
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
From Apple there

715
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Introducing the new photo iPod

716
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
For the first four or five minutes of my presentation

717
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,860
I said sure to that I figured it'd increase the people in the audience

718
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,860
But better yet we get to segue right from the new photo iPod

719
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I can segue into another you've seen that

720
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
Let me show you how that things really supposed to be used

721
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,860
Should be a great weekend if

722
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,860
They can stop by my blog at mwgblog.com

723
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Look for the podcasting 101 link

724
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,860
And it'll give you all the details how to get their times and locations

725
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Also I don't want to forget to mention that August and Ray over at iPod

726
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,860
Rex have been kind enough to donate two licensed copies of their iPod

727
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,860
Rex software for us to raffle off one on Saturday and one on Sunday

728
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,860
So this is a real deal man. We are going to be spreading the podcasting word

729
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,860
Adam you keep up the good work and we'll talk to you soon

730
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
I'm Michael that's so excellent

731
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,860
And it was cool to meet Michael because I I had no idea what he did in real life

732
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,860
I shouldn't I shouldn't tell you if real life

733
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
There's another side to Michael that you don't know about it

734
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,860
Would you get him to talk about that and other

735
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Either an audio comment maybe he'll do it on on real reviews

736
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,860
But it's nothing like the great movie reviews that he does

737
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,860
So yeah sounds like some cool stuff happening

738
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,860
And you know giving away some goodies helping people to get into podcasting

739
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Excellent and yeah, of course, always happy to promote that

740
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Okay, we're you know just about

741
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Yeah, actually 40 minutes so I'm at the a lot of time that I'd like to keep it, you know, keep the show tight at

742
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,860
This is one last bit of some audio from a piece of video that has been circulating around the net

743
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,860
I had heard about it from my friend Ron Bloom who now actually has a weblog

744
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
And he's pointed to it on this weblog

745
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,860
It is a piece of video from CNN where John Ashcroft

746
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Break seemed to song and I mean not just you know just any old song

747
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,860
He sings the song let the eagle sore and he's got his vibrato going and he's

748
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,860
You got to listen to a little bit of it now. So the whole song it's different pieces cut together

749
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,860
But then this is you know we didn't know he had these hidden talents

750
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:37,860
Let the eagle song listen to that vibrato

751
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:45,860
Like she's never saw before from a rocky coast

752
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,860
To golden shore

753
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,860
Listen

754
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:09,860
And he's doing this I just want those regular conference bikes on the days

755
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,860
You know

756
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,860
Okay, so you got to see that video if you ever chance it's linked from the production notes

757
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,860
For today's daily source code and that will do it for the show tomorrow

758
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,860
We're gonna do some podcasting with the baby

759
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,860
So I think I think the name of the host is Santa or Nana next

760
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,860
We're gonna accidentally in there

761
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:49,860
So she'll probably just preconceived she'll probably one of those two bubbly English girls that'll be hosting the show

762
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,860
Look forward to that

763
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Again, I could be completely wrong and totally off the mark

764
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,860
But we will know tomorrow my friends so we'll be taking the sort of report in the source code

765
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,860
At the messy castle which we've almost moved and we're out of here

766
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
