1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We are casting all's life, and I'm curry.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hi everybody and good evening.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Or good afternoon.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Whatever it is, where you are.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Welcome to your daily source code.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's Thursday, October 21st, 2004.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not a curry coming to you from Flanders, Belgium.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're back in the bar slash studio here at Curry Castle.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's been a long day today.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As you know, I stayed over at the bunker last night in Amsterdam,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and I had the shareholders meeting today.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sat in plenty of traffic, although I did contemplate reporting the source code in the car.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I had so many clips and bits I had set up and wanted to play for,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but I decided just to wait till I got home.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We've got the in-laws here tonight.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, my pie has a little bit harder hearing,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so that you might be at the TV in the background,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
because we like to crank it up for him.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can I say hello?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And you may hear some keyboard rattling in the background,

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
as well as Christina.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you doing, huh?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What are you doing?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And TV message board.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't tell me you're posting good Charlotte stuff.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, she's yelling at people for saying good Charlotte.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's right.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Anyway, so we've got the source code cranked on this side of our community space here in the castle.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And the first thing I want to say is,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
there is almost no way to express my thanks,

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but also that of my family for the incredible outpouring of good thoughts and prayers and love.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And just wonderful words and hundreds of emails and stories that you shared.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Weblog postings.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It was really absolutely phenomenal.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And there were so many audio comments that came in.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We were all just totally dumbfounded.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It was absolutely beautiful.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I thank you so much.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I could fill three daily source codes with just the audio comments alone that were said.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was so beautiful.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so I'm not going to delve on it too long and play too much stuff.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can tell you, though, that mom underwent her PET scan today.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's the radioactive fluid.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I spoke to her after the test and she sounded great.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She was really happy with her first volume experience.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And she's really extremely positive and everything you've said and done really, really helps.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So I'm not going to, I do with this one particular audio comment I wanted to say,

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I wanted to play for you that was sent in because there were just some things that really picked me up and gave me a lot of energy, a great energy boost.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And the bit I'm going to play for you is from Raymond Port, who, well, if you don't remember,

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I met him just a couple of weeks ago for the first time while on the road in traffic.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here's what he sent to me in light of yesterday's source code.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello, world.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Anyone there?

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sounds kind of funny to start.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I know the recording of like this, but I think it's appropriate being the first audio recordings since,

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know, five, six years.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's supposed to be an audio comment to the daily source code of 20 of October, 2010 and 4.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Adam, yes, so that you got me in probably many others wondering, what does that mean?

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why is there no daily source codes?

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There must be probably a very good reason for that.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, today in the show it turned out to be actually a very bad reason.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Didn't use about your mom.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, you're telling sharing actually your feelings and explaining why and how and what it got me,

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
also emotional and probably others too.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It showed actually that there's one thing that you really have what it takes to get the reality of life into the show.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And this has happened many times before.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One time, I remember as the day of two weeks ago almost.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And that's when we kind of met when you were doing your daily source codes recording from the car.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I was passing by in traffic jam.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It got me to the energy boost that you were talking about.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I thought it would be nice to give you a little bit of energy back.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Take care in coming days, weeks, months.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And remember that many are with you in thoughts.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
See ya.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, but it was cool and college radio is cool.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And this podcast...

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, someone's holding up his iPod.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hold on, roll on your window.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Exit the net, thank you all for the name.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Here, come here.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's going on there?

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Rainbow boards.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Rainbow boards.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay dude.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Dude, we checked out a guy just drove up next to me.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And he's honking his horn and he's holding his iPod off.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And he's saying, I'm listening to the podcast.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
God damn, I said, I'm recording one right now.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a Raymond.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Buddy.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, that's very cool.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
See?

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is what I mean.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is what it's all about.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, that gives me a boost of energy.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, you can imagine that I got another boost as I heard that again.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And remember that, you know, I have a new friend.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
His name is Raymond.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know, we met two weeks ago on the highway.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thanks to the podcasting.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And just so much good and positive energy coming from all over the world.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Really, really appreciated.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And so, as I was alone in the bunker last night,

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and I had the bandwidth all to myself.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Of course, we have a high-speed connection there as well.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Only there's no bandwidth limits at all.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So, I was subscribing and checking out audio.weblogs.com

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and listening to everything new is it popped up, you know,

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
refreshing the page.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like, oh, what's this?

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know, it's a new one.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
By the way, if you want to get on audio.weblogs.com,

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it's real simple.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All you have to do is ping the server.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And it's a great place for, it's a great resource

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to go and check out what's, you know, was just updated.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, even if you have iPod or, you know,

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
just anywhere browser will let, you know,

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
if one of your favorites is updated or you might find something

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
that's completely new that you didn't know about before.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And there's information on how to ping the server

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
either through a web form or there's some technical information

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
there about how you're blogging client and blogging tool

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
can do it.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And there's lots of people all over the place who will be willing to help you.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So, as I was checking out the new shows and the regular shows,

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
my day completely, completely was made.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, I was just, I was bugging out.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was so happy.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I was listening to the Dawn and Drew show from two days earlier

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because I was catching up.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I heard, I mean, I heard just the most beautiful,

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
beautiful poem, and I want to share it with you.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I need an iPod.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I need it so bad.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I would give blow jobs on the corner.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They'd be the best you ever had.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you gave me an iPod, I'd suck on your wiener.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm half with a wiener and half Colombian being here.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh man, that really made my day.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, as promised, some indie music for you.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm going to kick it off with some Dutch guys.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, we're way happy that they're on the podcast.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Recording entirely on a Macintosh in their attic.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's my Jones and TV junkie.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, I can't tell you now.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's your long childhood dream?

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can't take it in the world.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't take it in the world.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't take it in the world.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't take it in the world.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can't take it in the world.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't take it in the world.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't take it in the world.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But something keeps me there.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I'm all alone.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll treat you turn it off again.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Maybe it won't come to an end.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't take it in the world.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can't take it in the world.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't take it in the world.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can't take it in the world.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't take it in the world.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I can't take it in the world.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No, no.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But something keeps me there.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm all alone.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll treat you turn it off again.

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Maybe it won't come to an end.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

181
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,000
I can't take it in the world.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't take it in the world.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, I can't.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, I can't take it in the world.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I like gotta carry the whole dog you've been free

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000

Go Jones on the source code TV junkie. You can find them at mojones.com moj.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Two brothers from the Netherlands who have been just touring around the country. Also parts of Belgium for the longest time.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They recorded this in their attic on a Mac. I don't know if you heard the Mac fanatics will have heard the start-up long sound there midway in the track.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I really think these guys are really really kick-ass.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And if you want to get your band or your song or it doesn't have to be rock and roll, it can be any style.

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let me know where I can download an MP3, check it out and make sure you also give me permission to do that.

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Christina was actually sitting here listening to me sing along with mojones. She said, well, play some good Charlotte.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Very hard to explain to her that we're going to get in trouble when we can't actually play that.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And what was I supposed to do, go top to epic events?

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Blackmail them. Oh, baby, what a great idea.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right, moving along. A little bit of semi-techno nerdy stuff here. Of course, try to make users and developers get together and party on the source code.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I ran across a great use of podcasting.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
From the iPod or developers mailing list and anyone can join that. You can see the link on the iPod.org homepage.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Join up and you can contribute. You don't have to join all the conversations. You don't have to understand that all.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And that works both ways by the way for users and developers.

227
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And the iPod or developer team is using, well, let Garth kid explain it himself.

228
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They're using their own technology while building the technology. Listen to a bit of this podcast.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Good morning. Welcome to the introductory iPod development team podcast. As we scale the team and power users start contributing code,

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
we need a way to keep each other up to date, despite incredibly flooded mailboxes.

231
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And the way I figure it is, what better way than to eat our own dog food.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This won't be a daily half hour, thank god, to probably most of you.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's probably going to be more intermittent small items, maybe once every few days or sometimes a few times in one day.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Who the hell am I? I'm Garth kid. It's Garth K at Gmail.com or GDK as as far as the CVS updates are concerned.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Radio, user land, early birds might remember my big mouth.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For a change, guys, I'm contributing as much code as I am would.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Actually, probably more. And to give you a break, I intend that the other developers are going to be dropping items into this cast as well.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm not going to be on 100% golf taking it off.

239
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay, Garth, get ahead of yourself there. So he goes on, he goes on for quite a bit longer.

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And actually, at the end of that first podcast, he let slip that they're working on a new release.

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And then now getting everything together and figuring out what features they want to put in there.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I suggest, if you're interested in you use the iPodder that they're working on, iPodder 1.0,

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
or Windows Mac, you should subscribe to that and check it out because maybe there's something in there that you have an idea about that you couldn't contribute to,

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
just from your own experience in using their iPodder program.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Something else that I thought was interesting set-up wise came in from a podcast.

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let's see, I wrote it down here.

247
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, shoot. I forgot what it's called, ITT.

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's a gentleman who comes.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The number one rated podcaster in the entire town of Bottle Washington.

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Right on, the creator of In the trenches.

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There it is, yeah.

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Your host, Kevin Devin.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Right, it's In the trenches, okay.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And he's setting up Skype recording on a podcast.

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Interesting way of putting it together, though.

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because apparently, it still takes two computers to really deal it right.

257
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, whatever it may be where you're at.

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Welcome to this edition of In the trenches.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
As far as that intro goes, I have to say, I like it.

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And it's mine, so until it gets old, I'm going to go ahead and keep it in there for a while.

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I altered it a little bit this week just to kind of play around with it a little bit.

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But I get others, I'll maybe put those in in this place, but for now, I'm kind of liking that one.

263
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So I'm just going to keep it there for a little bit.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So anyway, I had intended for this podcast to be done entirely.

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Via Skype.

266
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I've been working on a method to do it.

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I had done it once before, and I was pleased with that, but I wanted it something a little better.

268
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Unfortunately, tonight's attempts turn out to be worse than what I had done previously.

269
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But it did introduce a couple of cool elements into the whole mix, which I'm going to go ahead and play a clip of that anyway.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I did save some of it, I didn't throw it all on the floor, but I want to play some of it and just check it out.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's actually kind of neat.

272
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
All right, with me tonight, I have Chad Davis.

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Chad is a consultant working out of Konosha Wisconsin, and the operator operator of a blog.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Now I know what you're thinking, right?

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It sounds really noisy this connection, but wait until you find out what these guys actually have hooked up.

276
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's very cool.

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What are the interesting things of this podcast and what makes this one different from the others?

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is the equipment that we're using in this instance?

279
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Now, many people have talked about using Skype to facilitate the creation of a podcast interview or conversation.

280
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But I've noticed that folks have had a lot of problems either getting Skype to either capture both sides of the conversation or be able to route the audio internally,

281
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and almost impossible on a Microsoft or on a PC, a little bit easier on a Mac, but still there are some challenges.

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now in this instance, I'm cheating.

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm actually using two computers to facilitate this evening.

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm actually using Skype on my PC to create the conference call, okay, for one.

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The conference, I conference in the members, and I open up another session on the Mac.

286
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's an iMac 17.

287
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I launched the conference call, answered on the iMac, and then mute the mic and turn the volume all the way down on the Mac.

288
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Now the key piece of software here is a program called Audio Hydeject Pro from Rogue Amoeba, software.

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I simply hijacked the application and began recording.

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
When I'm done, I end up having an MP3 that's ready to go with the entire conversation, getting up course both ends,

291
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
because all that Mac is doing is just recording.

292
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So it's really slick in that aspect.

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Now I know what you're thinking, so why didn't you just use the iMac to do it all?

294
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, my thing is I want the ability to conference in more than just one person at a time.

295
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Right now you can't do that with Skype on the Mac platform.

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So, but I can do it on the PC.

297
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So, what I'm doing is I'm just using the best of both worlds.

298
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So, that's how I've got to set up and one thing I'm pleased with is the audio quality of Skype.

299
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's better than the way I was doing it before, which was just solely on the PC on my laptop,

300
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
but I was utilizing the speakers on my laptop to get the sound back up into the mic so that the other person could hear,

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and I could pick up both ends of the conversation.

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So, it's really kind of a cookie way of doing it there.

303
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And I didn't really like the speaking to my screen rather than having a headset.

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So, I wanted to use Chad for this initial Skype podcast for a couple of reasons.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
First off, this guy's been working on a logo for the show now for nearly the past week.

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Okay, I want to ask if I want to go for that.

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Okay.

308
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The stuff that he said to put up, let's do something else.

309
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

310
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know if I can get it to come on.

311
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You know.

312
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And it's a problem.

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't like that idea.

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So, I just want to say, I appreciate it.

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, I don't know if it is.

316
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Let him talk.

317
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hi, Pack.

318
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah, here it is.

319
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Check out at least what his Skype call is on.

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He's using an iPad on the other end of this line and you'll hear a lot of noise in the background.

321
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But that's because he's using an iPad with Skype loaded.

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So, in this instance, we're in this podcasting experience that we're doing tonight.

323
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We're using an iPad, a laptop, you know, a Toshiba laptop, and an IMAX 17.

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

325
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
All I can say about this is, damn cool.

326
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What do you do?

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Chad?

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, it's a pretty elaborate set up to do a pretty simple thing.

329
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But it works and it's only going to get easier and better.

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sure.

331
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I have a community.

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And the other thing that's kind of, you know, meat on this end.

333
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm just saying here, I mean, using my Pack and PC is, you know, I'm just running over a Wi-Fi connection.

334
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So I'm basically, you know, free of anything.

335
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay.

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, um, and now a lot of you have been sending me emails about the Skype development team,

337
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
because, you know, the Mac software for a Skype is significantly behind the Windows version of it.

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So I now, I now know that Skype Windows can do conference calling.

339
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Now, I already used Skype to do with Skype out to actually, you know, make actual telephone calls.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It is almost the perfect piece of software.

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We shouldn't have to be stringing up multiple computers together to make it work.

342
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You know, and lots of people who are trying to, you know, get me on the leads with the development team.

343
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But they must not have their ears on or something, man.

344
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Because they're, look at what people are willing to do and to what lengths for willing to go to try and use your software.

345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I hope you hear us, you know, reach out so that we can start giving you some real feedback here.

346
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You know, I've looked around.

347
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, I know that their developers apparently are in Estonia, but I can't find any, any developer lists or whatever.

348
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I just have nowhere to look.

349
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So I hope that they're listening because, you know, their software could be a very important integrated part of what podcasting is all about.

350
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So that comes from in the trenches, a great podcast.

351
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You can find it, of course, from, uh, or through iPod.org in our directory under the technology section.

352
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
See, what else do they want to hit? Oh, I've got so many cool things.

353
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I've got different all different user podcasts in today's show.

354
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And some more great RIA free music on the way by a well-known established man who've done something cool.

355
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But first, a little bit of podcast history for those of you just kind of tuning into the source code and new to the whole podcast phenomenon.

356
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Hey, it's only what? Two and a half, three months old.

357
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Bill kind of sums it up and there's next audio comment that he sends it to Dave and myself.

358
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And check out somebody else to say.

359
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And I'm Korean Dave Weiner subject to this audio note is podcasting takes off. Thanks to Adam and Dave.

360
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I've been listening to, to you and Dave, audio blogs since they, since you really ignited the movement and podcasting, which, if you can believe it,

361
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
it was only back in mid August, as I recall for Adam, it was Friday the 13th.

362
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why would you pick such a beginning? Anyhow, no sign of what was to come because things have been great.

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Adam, you're, you're podcasting is a bit more polished than Dave's.

364
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And I'm sure it's because you're experiencing the entertainment.

365
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm also much prettier.

366
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But both of you are just really set apart from the rest of the crowd.

367
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Mainly because you're attitude, you're both so excited and it comes through loud and clear in your, in your postings in your podcast.

368
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Something that I might add would be nearly impossible to convey in the usual blogging fashion with text.

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The excitement carries in to the intellectual domain as you guys feed off of each other, talking about the future of podcasting.

370
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
How the momentum is building the multitude of possibilities, trade secrets show.

371
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's for the naysayers that you're still kind of hanging around out there, but I think seller falling by the wayside.

372
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You know, they keep whining about I did an audio blog, back in blah, blah, blah, blah.

373
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But I might point out that you're just in what you do not what you say.

374
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And YouTube guys, certainly have done it for the rest of us.

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Set in the example day after day, sharing your growth with us on the HowToSide, establishingipider.org.

376
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And all the enabling infrastructure that that entails.

377
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Don't know if or when I might start podcasting, but for now I'm really enjoying the ride.

378
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
As I listen to you guys and Dave Slusher and others,

379
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Hammy some truly enjoyable tracks to entertain and educate me when I, when I choose and how I choose.

380
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Anyhow over and out, this is Bill Riskai.

381
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You can email me at bill at riskai.biz.

382
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
All right, Bill.

383
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So this might have sounded a little bit like a strokeathon, which of course is always appreciated.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But the point here is that, you know, this is really the history of, of, of, of, of, of, I bother and podcasting and just about two minutes there that Bill sent in.

385
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And, you know, I've been doing a lot of interviews, a lot of people have been calling me and Dave for publications, you know,

386
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What's going on with this podcasting? What's it all about? What is I potter?

387
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And, you know, I found that as journalists start looking more and more into it into the phenomenon that's happening here, what's going on.

388
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know, that, yeah, there's been a lot of people putting up stuff in MP3 form on the web that is not necessarily, you know, a track of a song, you know,

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's being used for all kinds of different purposes in audio.

390
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Go look at archive.org.

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I mean, there's, there's just amazing amounts of, of great sound available at the MP3 format.

392
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And it's been available for years, of course.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The only thing that was added here was, you know, just a couple of connections in the distribution.

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But I do also want to point out that Chris Leiden, who Dave worked with about a year ago,

395
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
was definitely the first person to put up a regular series of MP3s in an RSS feed as enclosures.

396
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And I'd been receiving those through my radio, userland aggregator.

397
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So, you know, it's, it's been a process. It's not just Dave and I.

398
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's been the process of, you know, a lot of things working together and some important protocols and formats that were established along the way.

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And it just seems to be growing, you know, I keep saying,

400
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
When is the hype going to be over, but it doesn't seem to be slowing at all,

401
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Particularly when I see the kind of content that's coming online and I have to, and this would definitely qualify as content this next podcast.

402
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm not quite sure if it's something that's repurposed that is already being created.

403
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It sounds like it could be, but then again, maybe not.

404
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And it is qualifying as a podcast and it's a weekly show and it's brand new.

405
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I caught it off audio.weblogs.com.

406
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's the agriculture news weekly.

407
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I love the whole sound of the show.

408
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You kind of get to get that Dallas vibe here from their music.

409
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Perfect.

410
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Come on.

411
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Great job.

412
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Congratulations to Texas on the campus of Texas A&M University.

413
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's active weekly for Monday, October 18, 2004.

414
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We've got a hype about 90 degrees here in Texas and College Station.

415
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
High humidity.

416
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I could take with the high humidity rate is right now, but it's, it's pretty sticky outside.

417
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Got a lot of good stuff going on today.

418
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
In particular, our key news item of the day is,

419
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
look at the U.S. exports to Cuba.

420
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
They've more than doubled from a year ago, according to Dr. Parasin,

421
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
who's our extension economist in the director of the Center for North American Studies at Texas A&M.

422
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Paras.

423
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't know if you want to know all that about Cuba and agriculture,

424
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
but obviously the point here is that this is an excellent use.

425
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What a incredible information value this can have.

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I can just see all kinds of guys rolling around on the prairie with their iPods and their side holsters,

427
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
but it's great.

428
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm really happy to see this kind of stuff come along.

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And also, we've been talking about different languages coming online.

430
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
A lot of German podcasts have counted five or six that have come up in the just past week.

431
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And some exciting news from our German friends who are responsible for the poet cast.

432
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Hello, Adam.

433
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This is Christian Hesman from Germany.

434
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm the host of the poet cast, German podcast about poetry.

435
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And of course, normally this wouldn't be that entertaining for your audience,

436
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
but today I have the chance to introduce a guest on my show,

437
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Bratty Chapman from the U.S.

438
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And here I'd like to participate on my show on a regular basis.

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I hope at least once a week, and to read English poetry.

440
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Which means I'll do a complete English podcast from time to time.

441
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And I thought this might be something the international community might be interested in.

442
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You might check it out at www.hesi.org-potcast.

443
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
This is h-e-s-i.org-s-potcast.

444
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And keep up the good work.

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Goodbye from Germany.

446
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Okay, thank you very much, Christian.

447
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So that's German podcast, which now will come to you in English.

448
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And you can subscribe to it.

449
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So it'll come into your iPod, your MP3 player completely automatically.

450
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Now, we found out that there is indeed a language element for the Finnish language in RSS 2.0.

451
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And it looks like our Scandinavian friends are really catching on with the podcast,

452
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
because just when you heard a podcast from Helsinki,

453
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
which even though it was in English, there was a real cool Finnish accent going on,

454
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
check out what I found on audio.weblogs.com.

455
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's a Swedish podcast, let's say.

456
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's a Swedish podcast, let's say.

457
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a Swedish podcast, let's say.

458
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's a bit of a scene that is on the afternoon,

459
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think it's February 8th.

460
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I also think it's my favourite book.

461
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I love this.

462
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I can understand some of it.

463
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I really like it.

464
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I like it a little bit.

465
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
How do you like it?

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I like it.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I like it.

468
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I like it.

469
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's a podcast.

470
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
There's something weirdly sexual about this, listen.

471
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I like it a lot.

472
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I like it a lot.

473
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
There's something great.

474
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You feel audio-blogger.

475
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Swedish podcast.

476
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Alright, moving right along.

477
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Pick something up from a ko-mo 1000.

478
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I think I mentioned before that we've had a hows of Amsterdam,

479
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm up for sale for about three years.

480
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But the market is so completely dead.

481
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's like, they sure there people look in,

482
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
but no one is buying anything.

483
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Certainly not in the upper regions of the market.

484
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
it. And when we bought it, we bought it from a gay couple who would just recently renovated

485
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,680
the entire thing. And one of the features that, although we didn't really necessarily

486
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,200
need that or never dreamt about it, but one of the features was the toilets that were installed

487
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,440
in this house. And you have to admit, this was a guy house. They even had in one bathroom

488
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,640
that had a urinary automatic urinary just kind of walk in, do your business and walk

489
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:16,120
out into flushes automatically. And the toilets, when you sit down on the actual toilet

490
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,920
seat, the first thing that happens is there's a suction that kind of just very nice

491
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:29,320
thing silently, suction's off any offensive odourers that might be floating around. Then

492
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,640
I'm talking about our toilet. I just said gay men, a gay couple, yeah.

493
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,640
They're gay couple, could be a good one. Oh no, those are lesbians. They're not gay.

494
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,840
We won't enjoy the toilet too. Yeah, well, but lesbians don't like urinals. Okay, thanks

495
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,320
on. I got a little crib sheet here, Patricia's wrote on it and says, hey, it was gay men.

496
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,480
Make sure you mention it. Thanks on it. So anyway, so after you've sat down on the toilet

497
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,640
and the suction, this kind of vacuum, I should record this. Next time in Amsterdam, I'll

498
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,200
record all the sounds our toilet makes. So anyway, when you're done with your biz, whatever

499
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,720
it is, then you hit a button on the side and then a little water spout comes out, kind

500
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,080
of right underneath, you know, it's positioned pretty well actually. And then it squirts a nice

501
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:26,560
stream of warm, welcoming, room-like feeling of water. And then when you let go of the

502
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,760
button, then, then, of course, the dryer comes on. You get nice little warm kind of thing

503
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,640
and y'all, you dry off and then when you're ready, you're done and you're done, right?

504
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,200
So it's a full service toilet. And lo and behold, what do I hear on Como News this morning?

505
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,760
Contractors have built homes with glorious woodwork, spectacular layouts and spared no

506
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,920
expansion nearly every room. And when it came to the bathroom, just throwing one of those

507
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,840
hundred dollar toilet jobs and everybody uses. I think that they're better ways to do

508
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,480
just about everything. Thomas Crapers invention is morphing into a more comfortable and cleaner

509
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,960
experience. Never not quite fit on a standard toilet seat. For a large person, there's nothing

510
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,160
more comfortable. A ton Levi invented the big John toilet seat, making the job more comfortable

511
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,200
for the larger person. It's got stainless steel can do metal, never trade. Along with bigger seats,

512
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,200
there's now a lot of extras. He didn't toilet seats. We've got seats to do all sorts of things.

513
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Dan Sherman is my tour guide at a better bathroom kitchen in Belviewee. He says Japan has

514
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,200
been using high-tech toilets for years. And that's not something that we've had traditionally.

515
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,400
Let's go to the bathroom. Let's go to the bathroom. Introducing the new toe toe,

516
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,080
we arrest. When you walk up to it, it opens automatically. Press this button on this infrared remote

517
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,600
control. Whoa man, infrared remote control. Then we get to the cool part. You see, the new arrest

518
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,720
has a built-in but day. It automatically adjusts to you and you control the temperature of the water.

519
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,760
There's also a built-in dryer, a built-in deodorizer. Now that may be too fancy for some of you,

520
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,680
and the price tag of five grand may be too spending. But you've got to admit,

521
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,960
taking care of business. You'll never be the same again. Brian Carr, comma 1000 news.

522
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,120
Oh, clearly I have an outdated model. I don't have a heated toilet seat. What's wrong with me?

523
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,080
All right, so more cool music for you right now. This was uh, I got turned on to this by the

524
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,200
indie feed podcast. The Beastie Boys have released a track in MP3 on the internet. Free of all rights,

525
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,720
clear of any RIA, shit, whatever you can do whatever you want with it because they have a real message

526
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,240
in this song. And that's why they said, please, play this anywhere you can. They didn't specifically

527
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,920
say podcast, but I'm sure they meant it deep in their heart. Check out the Beasties in a world

528
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:51,060
gone mad.

529
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,580
Screens and lines

530
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,680
Just like a politician

531
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,060
Put the action by the scars

532
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,160
Nuts and arms to pick it

533
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,400
Like back in the days

534
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,200
With the cocaine and the thoughts

535
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,700
Yeah

536
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,000
You feel more positive

537
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,080
You can get more bold

538
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,400
That you're made like crazy

539
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,640
It's more unfold

540
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
What you want to do

541
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Is they hit strong up with that access

542
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,280
That you must get on hold

543
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,240
I'll see you soon

544
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,000
Number 2, 2018

545
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,840
Polychensions are shady

546
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,280
So people watch you back

547
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,480
But think they're so crap

548
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,360
I don't doubt it

549
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,680
It's a hell of an act

550
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,200
We don't want to go mad

551
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,440
We want to be better

552
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,600
Say you want to fly

553
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,200
Let's see

554
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,800
Let's fly

555
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,760
We want to go

556
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,480
All day

557
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,240
In half two

558
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,160
Time will fight

559
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,960
The man will fly

560
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,680
It goes

561
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,720
For some more

562
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,360
Jair now

563
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
We're in a rap

564
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
We're reaching our point

565
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,560
We're the can't turn back

566
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,760
Let's lose the gun

567
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,960
The less lose the bomb

568
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,640
So stop the corporate

569
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,400
Culture business

570
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,040
If they're built

571
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,600
The ball

572
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,320
We're sleeping on this

573
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Did you tell us

574
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,840
Stop the snorkees

575
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,560
Cause I'm weak

576
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,200
And it goes

577
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,800
Oh

578
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,200
Oh

579
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,320
I'm a little

580
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,920
I'm a little

581
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm a little

582
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm a little

583
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,640
Beast of the little

584
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,240
I don't get a strong

585
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,680
Cause we love the barricade

586
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,920
But that's no reason

587
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,120
It's their request

588
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,840
And then the end of the zero

589
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,400
We're bringing bout-fills

590
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,680
We ain't having it

591
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,960
We don't want to go mad

592
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,360
The power he brought

593
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,400
Say you want to fly

594
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,760
We say

595
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
It's both

596
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,600
We're going on

597
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,920
We're getting up

598
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,280
Do it

599
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,000
We fight

600
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,560
We're going on

601
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,120

Sweet.

Bobby, Bobby.

654
00:38:36,520 --> 00:39:06,480
Beasty Boys, in a world gone mad, you can download that from BeastyBoys.com and

655
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,400
as I said, you can use it on any podcast and any manner, that you wish because they've

656
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,560
released it completely free of all royalties, rights are immediately cleared, you can go ahead

657
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:24,800
and play that on your podcast if I liked it. It's a typical Beasty. But the words definitely

658
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,000
have to have some meaning to it. All right, 40 minutes, that's about my tax for the show,

659
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,440
so we're going to leave it here for today's source code, 40 minutes to see is just about the

660
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,280
time it takes for Dave Wyner to make his entire walk around the Seattle whatever his daily

661
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,600
walk is, and he says 40 minutes about growth, so keep it a bad for now. Hey, at tomorrow

662
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,480
by the way, Dave and I will be on the Gilmore gang, which will guess it'll be out over the
