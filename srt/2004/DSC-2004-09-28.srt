1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Well, howdy everybody welcome to this

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
It is Tuesday, September 28th, 2004.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
It's Tuesday afternoons, 5...

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
an interesting day. On the phone a lot of people doing a lot of stuff. I kind of chilled

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
out yesterday and Monday and all I did basically was record a really long source code. I went

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
up to Breda not only for the stop off of my buddies at the Moroccan place but also went

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
back to a premiere last night of a musical. Let's dial down the music a little bit.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is a musical done by a friend of ours, a big musical production that's called

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Love Me Just a Little Bit More and it's based on or not really based on, it's a story that

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
uses all of the songs by this girl band from the 80s from Holland called The Dolly Dots.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I've forgotten how many songs they had made. Lots of albums and it was kind of

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
like a grease. In the 80s you had grease which was about the 1950s. So this was pretty

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
much 2004, almost 2005 and we're looking back at the 80s. It was a high school and

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but it was it was

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,500
funny and it made me feel old on one hand but also it you know it made me laugh

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,500
and it made me also proud of some of the leg well now I guess if you look at leg

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,500
warmers and big hair and shoulder pads as the legacy of the 80s maybe we

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
shouldn't be so proud but it was it was alright so I just kind of dicked around

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
yesterday and today had to do a bit of business take care of some stuff make

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,500
sure the empire is running right and been on the phone this morning I saw that

21
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Dave was online and I gave him a quick instant message and he said you know

22
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
let's switch audio and so we did and I've learned by now that I've got to keep

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
the record button handy because of all of a sudden you know we're getting into

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
some interesting conversation and we'll say hey you know let's record this and

25
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Dave wanted to record it I don't know why but we did so a new trade

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
secrets born a short one like 36

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
The good news is we get the SIP phone stuff working but it was 3 a.m. where Dave was and

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,500
he was over modulating and I knew I'd have to walk him through the mic levels and we

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
were talking about something else.

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
But it did work and all it really took on his end if you'll remember if you caught

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,500
our trade secrets where we were trying to get that system working, the problem was

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Dave just had to reboot his machine.

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
So he rebooted and it worked.

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
But we got to work on the quality.

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
I'm sure we can get it working but the good news is if we can get the SIP phone

36
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,500
working I think with the free X10 Lite version I can conference three calls in

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
together which means we could do a call-in show because we can set up a

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,500
virtual phone number, we can set up a couple, I'll set up one in New York, in

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,500
California and in the United Kingdom and then basically you dial that number

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
if it's local to you which should be you know we should be able to pretty

41
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
much get local service you know that should be local to a lot of people who

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
listen to this and it shouldn't be too bad to call if you're someone.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
in the middle. And then that'll be routed through to my SIP phone. On one hand I'll be talking

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to Dave and then we can just conferencing, I guess, two more lines. And if I can't do

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
it with the free version, then after some testing, after I'm convinced that this is

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
going to work for us, then we'll do it. We'll buy a pro version or whatever. There's

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
also this thing called the Asterix PBX, which is a software-based PBX. You can route

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
calls and stuff all over the place. It's open source. It's beautiful. It also works

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
on OSX. But I thought it was a little bit too much overkill for what we're trying to

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
do. But as we progress, and as this coming Thursday, I think, we're going to try and

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
do a trade secrets together. So I can't be a soliloquy, I guess, if it's

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
together. Still word of the week, soliloquy. We're going to record a trade

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
secrets while we're watching the presidential debate. And is it just me

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
or is something wrong with Mac.com's email today? Because I think that,

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
all of a sudden, just stop receiving mail. I forward my email from curry.com to

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
adamcurry.com.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
And nothing's coming in.

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
And the Surefire test is I went into the web browser, into the webmail, and sent an email

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
to myself at www.mc.com from that address and it hasn't shown up.

60
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
So I think something's wrong with Apple's email system, which bites.

61
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Where's the announcement?

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Put something on your web page.

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Come on.

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
It can't be just my account.

65
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm sure.

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I hope not.

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Maybe it's filled up.

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Is there a way to see if your account?

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
No, it's only 250 messages in there.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
No, it can't be filled up.

71
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Anyway, lots of clips and bits to play for you today.

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Lots of new stuff coming on the radar.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Some exciting prospects to talk about today.

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
And actually I wanted to just kick it off with some tunes because I haven't really

75
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
had a chance to play anything today.

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
And if you don't like it, skip it!

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Rock and roll, Hoochie-Coo, Rick Derringer.

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Thanks for watching!

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

80
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Boy.

81
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Yeah baby.

82
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Ended up there.

83
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
All right.

84
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I keep wondering about what I want to, you know, what kind of songs I want to play in

85
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
the source code and I always want to.

86
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Um, actually, who was that?

87
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I got an email about that because I'd asked, you know, do you really listen to the song

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
or not?

89
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What is crypt? Crypt says, I usually always skip the songs.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
By guess that's just my taste in music. Keep it up. See ya.

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Crypt. So, you know, it's like that's the beauty of this.

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you don't like the song, just skip ahead.

93
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know, it's gonna be three or four minutes later on in the show.

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Also, I've been, every single morning I scan the,

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
as I go through my new shows playlist on my iTunes or on my iPod,

96
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
depending where I am.

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The Blog Digger Media Feeds and The Feedster MP3 Feeds.

98
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And there's a lot of stuff that comes through there.

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's some really wacky stuff too.

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then some music shows up once in a while.

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's see what came in today.

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Some Fleetwood Mac live stuff.

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You know, the odd audio blog post,

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
just that which is just titled as a number.

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Gosh, it's so sad.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know, there's so many really interesting things

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that just no way to trace the origin,

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
because people don't put any kind of ID.

109
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
metadata into their files and you're just like, I wish I could find where this came from.

110
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,500
See what was the, there's some new IT conversations stuff came in which I haven't heard yet.

111
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
A new memory lane with Halley suit, looking forward to that.

112
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Also something good on ITconversations.com which was open source in healthcare.

113
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
It's about a 14, 15 minutes podcast.

114
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Interesting industry and if you're in open source definitely check that show out.

115
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Okay, let's switch over now to a good buddy of ours who's been sending stuff into the show

116
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,500
and has been helping out with settings. It's our pal, Dr. Dave from Las Vegas.

117
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Dr. Dave, surely quite an audio professional.

118
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
And he checked in again, sent us another voicemail. Here's Dr. Dave.

119
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Hello Adam, Dr. Dave from Las Vegas. I'd like to thank you for broadcasting my previous

120
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,500
numerous replies and they've all been positive. It seems as though you have the ability to

121
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
reach the outermost portions of the planet, both geographically and atmospherically.

122
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Yeah, well, and that's just with my hair, Dr. Dave. Wait until my ego comes up.

123
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,500
An update on my email address. I've been attacked by spam people who are using my

124
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
old email address as a return address, thus yielding

125
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
emails a day most of them

126
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
So, uh, I have changed the email address.

127
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Please take note, Dr. Dave-USA at cox.net.

128
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Also, Dr. Dave-USA at gmail.com.

129
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
From Las Vegas, it's Dr. Dave Clear.

130
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Now, I love that.

131
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Dr. Dave, from Las Vegas, it's Dr. Dave Clear.

132
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
All right, Dave, thanks very much, man.

133
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
And I'm sure that you'll get all kinds of interesting email now.

134
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Now that we've played this on the source code.

135
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
And check in once in a while, you know.

136
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Let us know what you're doing, what you're working on.

137
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I like having all kinds of different voices on the show.

138
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And I do want to send out props to Mark Cantor for a second.

139
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was going to mention that during the trade secret show that Dave and I cut this morning

140
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
because something has been popping into my head for a while now.

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
From a conversation I had many, many years ago when I was still living in the state

142
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and we had our company think new ideas.

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I was hanging out with Mark, which is actually where I hooked up with Dave

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Weiner.

145
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And Mark and I, we fall in and out of love all the time.

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think a lot of people do that with Mark.

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But he did say at one point, he said, Adam, what we need is we need someone to introduce

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
this stuff, this new stuff that we're doing that we're creating.

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We need a VJ for the music videos of the internet.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And when it comes to podcasting, I think that I'm fitting into some role similar to that.

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm liking it because people are sending me links to new shows and audio bits.

152
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I think there's so much more that we can do.

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And Mark said to me today, could someone put together a podcast of dinner music?

154
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
So just basically a playlist, put together a playlist of dinner music.

155
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Now granted that's not exactly what we're doing with podcasting but wow, if you had a

156
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,500
mixed list, not just something that, well yeah, really a mixed list.

157
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Make a beautiful mix.

158
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:24,500
It could also be one podcast channel that has different songs in it.

159
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
But it could be that or it could be...

160
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
So the other thing that I heard was I had like a financial news show, you know, an analyst

161
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:30,500
doing a...

162
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,500
be, maybe that's only a one minute or a two minute podcast, but wow, I'd love to have that

163
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,500
sitting in my queue, you know, in my playlist queue.

164
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Now, how do I come up with all that?

165
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,500
It doesn't matter because right along with Dr. Dave, Dr. Dave, of course, you know, I

166
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
had this visual of Dr. Dave.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,500
He's one of these guys with this, you know, the huge gonad voice and he does all the

168
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
voice overs for the movies.

169
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Maybe you're like in a world where men are men and women are looking scared.

170
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,500
You know, he just sits at home in his studio and people dial up with an ISDN and

171
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
he cuts all these recordings and he may not even know what he's really doing

172
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,500
him for.

173
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
He's just doing it, you know, and it's a great way to make a living because

174
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
he's basically podcasting for money.

175
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Something else we're going to talk about today, by the way.

176
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And I received a nice response and email from Tony Khan

177
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
from WGBH in Boston.

178
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Remember, he's the one that sent me the 1-800 called dad.

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
a sound clip from the morning stories and they're putting together a podcast feed. So

180
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
he sent me a mail he said,

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
which is great. And he also sent me another morning stories which relates to Dr. Dave and also

182
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
the how politics work in America. I want you to listen to Fumfer Klackett for Senator.

183
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Bill, Bill, you all warmed up in there, Bill?

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what are we doing today, Larry?

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a last minute commercial for the Fumfer Klackett for Senator. You got this right there.

186
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right here.

187
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, good. Let's do it. Hey, rollin' on Fumfer Klackett for Senate. Take one, make it, sing, baby.

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Fumfer Klackett, you know where he stands.

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, actually, I don't. But where does he stand, Larry?

190
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Uh, what difference is it?

191
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, there's a long list of issues here. Larry, am I supposed to sound

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
former or against him?

193
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Uh, well, take one later.

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, okay.

195
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Fumfer Klackett, you know where he stands on taxes, abortion, the economy, condoms in the school.

196
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
All right. Okay, now sound.

197
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
for them. Okay.

198
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Fumferklacket. You know where he stands. On taxes. Abortion. The economy. Condoms in

199
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,500
school. Beautiful. Okay now for the finish just read his name. What? Just Fumferklacket?

200
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Yeah. Fumferklacket. Oh what's gonna be on the screen?

201
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Well, it's early in the morning. A bird, a duck, a bus, a bus. His wife and dog are

202
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,500
in the background. He's got a three-piece suit and a briefcase and he's taken out.

203
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
That's beautiful Larry. So say his name. Fumferklacket.

204
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Uh, eat something Bill. Try saying his name like it's the answer to a question.

205
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You mean like what rhymes with the grimble gracket Fumferklacket?

206
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
The only without the question. Try and...

207
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Who's the guy with the dbdis? Fumferklacket.

208
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Who got indicted for tax evasion last year? Fumferklacket.

209
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Great. What for?

210
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Who's probably not gonna pay his campaign bills? Fumferklacket.

211
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
You...

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, uh, say, listen Larry?

213
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

214
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He is gonna pay, isn't he?

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Fumferklagget.

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sure.

218
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't see me in the election.

219
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You later!

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Larry?

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Larry?

222
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Larry!

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Fumferklagget.

224
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Fumferklagget for Senator.

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So, uh, some stuff to think about there, huh?

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Isn't it interesting how the message changes with the tone of voice and with the music,

227
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
thanks to WGBH, soon to have their own podcasting feed of these morning stories up, I'm sure.

228
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And I can't wait because I love them.

229
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is great on my walk during the day.

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't really have a commute these days.

231
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Once a week I go up to Amsterdam, going up tomorrow, by the way.

232
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I get to catch up on stuff.

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But I love having that stuck in my playlist.

234
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay, let's see.

235
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Right.

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Here's something that I heard Dave cut a coffee note about an interview that he did with...

237
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,500
with Yahoo or about Yahoo, about Yahoo's new RSS service.

238
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,500
And he says in the beginning of this blog post, and I have it queued up to something, honestly,

239
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I can't quite remember what I have it queued up to.

240
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
And we'll find out in a second.

241
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
But in the beginning of this blog post, or even on his web blog,

242
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
linking to the podcast, Dave said, you know,

243
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I just did an interview with Yahoo, and I thought, you know,

244
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I really want to get my thoughts out there about what I was saying.

245
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
And I encourage you to listen to it because there's some important stuff

246
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
as it pertains even to podcasting.

247
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
You know, they're going to come trying to leech off of this stuff as well.

248
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
And he said, you know, I want to get my thoughts out there.

249
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
And what he really should have done is he should have recorded the interview

250
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
while the interviewer was interviewing.

251
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I want to talk about that for a second.

252
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
But first let's just see what I had queued up here from Dave Weiner's

253
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
coffee notes for the 27.

254
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
This icon on your site.

255
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Do they know who I am? I mean...

256
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why would I want to do that?

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, why would I want to tell my readers that...

258
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They should favor this one aggregator over all the other aggregators.

259
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why would I do that before I would put an icon on my site that sent them to Net Newswire

260
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,000
or to even to, I would rather send them to Ampheddesk or, you know, or, you know, or

261
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Feedster or.

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So, I'm not quite sure why I queued that up.

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That doesn't really make sense in the whole story, but that's kind of, that did

264
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:36,000
give you an impression of what, you know, the tone of voice that Dave was using and he recorded that at night and listen to that because you'll like it and what he's talking about and it's good to understand what Yahoo was doing and actually how opportunistic they're being right now and the stuff that we've been building.

265
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But I wanted to touch back on what Dave said at the beginning of his podcast.

266
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
He says, you know, I should have recorded that interview and I think I've said this before.

267
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't know if I wrote it on my web blog or if it wasn't in a source code.

268
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I mean, this stuff is like, you know, life and source code and trade secrets, all kinds of runs.

269
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It runs together.

270
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't know what who else.

271
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,500
to what anymore. But I've done this successfully and I encourage anybody who's listening to

272
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,500
this show who is interviewed by the media and most likely that will happen by a telephone.

273
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
And I know that there are many of you who have been interviewed or are being interviewed

274
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,500
and I know how disappointed you probably have been certainly after the first interview

275
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
that you do, what really shows up in print. And I get interviewed all the time, me and

276
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,500
my wife and I are well known in the Netherlands, very well known.

277
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,500
So for some reason we're medium magnets here, go figure. But I've learned that if you say

278
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,500
to a journalist who wants to interview you, usually for print publication, because these

279
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,500
are quote the most serious, right, that if you say, okay, you know, that's fine, but

280
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I also want to record the interview and I want to reserve the right to put that

281
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,500
raw data out there on the internet. And they can't really object because nine times

282
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
out of 10, the interviewer will be recording the conversation.

283
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
conversation, even when they do a phone interview, they'll record the conversation.

284
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So if they have the right to do that, so should you.

285
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And you know what, they're so bold over by the question that they're like, well, okay.

286
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They say, but I want to have the right to put that source code on the internet.

287
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And no one has rejected me so far, and I also have never put the source code of the

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
interview on the internet because I haven't, there was no need to.

289
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But boy, do they really drill down on their facts and do their checking.

290
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And right now, if you don't have a recording device, get to Skype.

291
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You call the interview, you call him or her.

292
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Record it with wiretap or whatever and just keep it there.

293
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Just keep it safe.

294
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If you don't like the interview.

295
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
This guy's full of shit.

296
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
And this is exactly what I said.

297
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
This was his question.

298
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
This is the context.

299
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
And you can check out the source code right here.

300
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
So that's something that can work very successfully.

301
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
And I suggest you give it a try.

302
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
And in fact, maybe someone will set up

303
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
a podcast feed of interviews that way.

304
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Who knows?

305
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Who knows what will happen?

306
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,500
If I were a journalist and I was getting paid for it,

307
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I think I would want to have my source codes made available

308
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
so that people could fact check me.

309
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Geez, what a great idea.

310
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
You write something in a magazine.

311
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
We can't fact check you with links or anything.

312
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
But if you've interviewed somebody,

313
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
put up the sound file of the interview that you did

314
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
so we can make our own decisions.

315
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
I guarantee you, I'm going to certainly

316
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
that source code to go to that source file.

317
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Okay, we have, okay, all right,

318
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
let's talk about money for a second.

319
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Because I heard, I remember we talked yesterday

320
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
about Dave Slusher who was wondering

321
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
should he take ads for his weblog.

322
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,500
And I see where all this is going is,

323
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
it's totally like weblogs.

324
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
There's really no difference.

325
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
We're using the same protocols to distribute it

326
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
and to aggregate it.

327
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
And so that's all webloggy.

328
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
And it's total freedom of speech.

329
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
You can do whatever you want.

330
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Do it whenever you want.

331
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
It's a little different to create the content

332
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
than just using a web browser or a text editor

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
or a blogging client, just writing words

334
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
and sticking in the occasional image source

335
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
or something to a link.

336
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
You have to figure out how to record something.

337
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
You have to wanna record it.

338
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
So it's not for everyone.

339
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Just like weblogging is not for everyone.

340
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
But there is a difference in the way

341
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,500
you experience a podcast versus a weblog.

342
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
For a weblog, first of all you have to...

343
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
to be in front of a computer. And I know you can be on a pocket PC and whatever, but you're

344
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
making a concerted effort to read something. When you're reading something, you pretty much

345
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
have to focus on that, which is why banner ads are so irritating. And I think that your

346
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
mind wraps around that. I don't see banners anymore. I just don't see them. My mind

347
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
a banner dimension size blob. I'm not just not going to look at that. That's why I think

348
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the other day when Dave and I were looking for the obvious login to that registration

349
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
site for the Free World Dialup, the login button was a big oblong purple blob. It looked

350
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
like a banner. I think Dave's mind parsed that out. Mine does.

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We've done that experiment recently. I think it's been going around the net a couple

352
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
times where it's a total dyslexic paragraph, but the first and the last letter are

353
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
in the correct spot as the correct letter and you can read it anyway even though

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it's all garbled. That's because of pattern recognition. So you know that was

355
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
so far with the business model for web pages and web blogs and click-throughs

356
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and all that. You have to sit in front of the computer. You have to make that effort.

357
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Maybe you're at work so it's on someone else's time but still it's

358
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
You're relaxing.

359
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500
You're in the obvious place where you can do only one of three things.

360
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
You're in the car.

361
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
You can do nothing.

362
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
You can listen to the radio or you can talk on the telephone.

363
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Or of course you could talk to someone else who's with you in the car.

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You usually turn to radio may be interrupted by the occasional

365
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And that's the space, oops, use the space word, but it is literally the space that we're

366
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
coming into.

367
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And your commute may be different.

368
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It may be with a different type of vehicle.

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You may not commute.

370
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You may just take a daily walk.

371
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Certainly there's a point in your day where you normally listen to radio, you're going

372
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
to flip on your podcast and you're going to get the stuff that you want and it's

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
going to be in the order that you want.

374
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And it doesn't take a concerted effort.

375
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
In fact, you're in a very relaxed mode.

376
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
My belief is that traditional commercials will happen.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I think that right now I have about 1500 subscribers to the daily source code.

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's not a big number.

379
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And if I went to Johnson and Johnson and said, hey, I'm going to sell your floor wax, these

380
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
1500 people, they're going to say, very interesting, Adam, hey, by the way, can I have your autograph?

381
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
My mom used to love watching on MTV.

382
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So that's not going to fly.

383
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let me just take a very simple example here.

384
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If I went to a conference.

385
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,500
organizer and I said, you know, you're making a conference and you charge people six, not

386
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,500
that I'm supporting conferences, etc., but just as an example.

387
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
I like the BloggerCon model myself.

388
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:23,500
But you're going to charge people three or $400 a pop to get into this conference and

389
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,500
you know, I think you should advertise because I have 1500 people of which many are in

390
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
the tech industry.

391
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Many will be in the neighborhood of your conference.

392
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Many will be interested in your conference and we know that they have

393
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,500
money because they have an iPod or something like it and a computer and

394
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,500
some type of broadband connection or access to one.

395
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,500
This is a desirable demographic and I want you to pay me, I don't know, $5 a week

396
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
or $500 a week.

397
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Let's say it's $500 a week and I can convince two people or three people

398
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,500
a day to go to this conference because of this paid advertisement.

399
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
That's worth it.

400
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
They just made money.

401
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
So it's the niche narrow casting.

402
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Now, of course, everyone's...

403
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Croning saying, oh commercial commercial

404
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Advertisement, we'll just skip past it. Yeah, if it's fucking boring you will this is something that Dave has been saying for a long time

405
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Excuse me

406
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Dave has been saying for a long time, make the commercials.

407
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Interesting.

408
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Make it more interesting.

409
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We'll listen to them.

410
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We'll buy products.

411
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Of course we will.

412
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Just make it more interesting.

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We're so used to this, you know, the way you have to spit stuff on the screen and

414
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
big letters and yell, you know.

415
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
That's the old way of doing things and it's just not that valuable anymore.

416
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:49,500
It's decreasing in value, I believe, unless you're in a commoditized product.

417
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,500
The scrappy thing is that we're using this commoditized way of selling things to elect

418
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
a president, but that's a different conversation and discussion altogether.

419
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,500
So how do you make these commercials better?

420
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
More interesting.

421
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
I'm not sure.

422
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I think what's very important is you have to know that you're being advertised to or

423
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,500
being marketed to.

424
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
And I always liked the way Howard Stern used to do the Snapple commercials.

425
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,500
He made it interesting by bringing in naked women and doing stupid games.

426
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Whether you like that or not, that was a part of his show and his audience like that.

427
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,500
And so then he'd say, I think Snapple's the best drink in the world.

428
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
And he probably did.

429
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
He might not have, but then he probably would have said, it's not the best drink,

430
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
but look, we got great chicks so buy this.

431
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
And then he basically made a deal with the listeners all the time.

432
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
He would say, go and buy.

433
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
buy our sponsors' products, please, keep the show on the air.

434
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So he's very honest about it, and that honesty I think will carry over and will work in this way.

435
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So as an example, how it could work, I don't think this is particularly a new and interesting commercial,

436
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
but it's funny. It's funny because I know that Doug Kay, who sent it to me, who said,

437
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the devil made me do it. I know that he meant it in jest. The echo chamber you're about to hear,

438
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
it's funny. Are we advertising a speedway or a conference here? There's an actual advertiser

439
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
in this that I'm about to play for you. I'm not getting paid for this, but it could happen.

440
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Doug, who, in association with Lachanome.com, presents NomeDex 4.

441
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,500
This year will be Steve Wozniak, Woz, Robert Scoble, Chris Tabono, Jim Loderback, Dan

442
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
and Steve Gilmore will be streaming the audio all

443
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Gilmore gang and for those who can't be there or listen to the live broadcast IT

444
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
conversations will podcast all of the sessions beginning next week so have your

445
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
iPods

446
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Head for www.itconversations.com and look for links to NomeDex4. And thanks for listening.

447
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The IT Conversations coverage of NomeDex4 is sponsored by Yahoo!

448
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A limelight, networks, magnitude, music, and decision cast.

449
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Be there, be there, be there, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday. That's great.

450
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know, and that was a commercial. It didn't suck. You didn't skip past it.

451
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I know you didn't. You wanted to hear it. It'll be only interesting one time.

452
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You're not going to listen to the next commercial sounds just like that,

453
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but you were marketed to. You heard that Yahoo! was sponsoring the Geek Fest.

454
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And the great thing about this, if you didn't hear it,

455
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
rewind and you got it. So,

456
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
watch out. I think there's something here. And again, and I know that people picked up on it.

457
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
NAB, they're going to show up pretty soon. They're going to have some stuff to say. I know it.

458
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay, let's play something from the blog digger media feed. This is just so weird.

459
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't know what it is or where it came from, but, you know, and I think if I was listening to it,

460
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I might even skip over it. So, I'll tell you how long it is.

461
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,500
is in case you want to. Three minutes and thirty seconds. It came in as only called Track 17,

462
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
which is of course totally useless so I don't know where it came from. It sounds like part of

463
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,500
it might be from a movie, maybe it is a movie. I've titled it, you know, Just Not Enough Cowbell.

464
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,500
And it sounds like Christopher Walken's in some of it. But listen to it and you know,

465
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
it's just something different, something you won't hear anywhere else but on the source code.

466
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Don't fear the reap, take one, roll. Alright, one, two, three, four.

467
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Bruce, could you come in here for a second please?

468
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Guys, what's the deal?

469
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Are you sure that was sounding okay?

470
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I'll be honest, fellas, it was sounding great, but...

471
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
I could have used a little more cowbell.

472
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Oh, it just hit me. This is Saturday Night Live. That's what it's for.

473
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I got to have more Cabra!

474
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
I got to have more...

475
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I could've used a little more cowbell.

476
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
You're gonna want that cowbell!

477
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Coward!

478
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Guess what?

479
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I got a fever!

480
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And the only prescription is more cowards!

481
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I gotta have more cowards!

482
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,500
The last time I checked we have a whole lot of songs that feature the Kalvass.

483
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I guess I'm locked out.

484
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yes, what?

485
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I can't believe it!

486
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And the only question is what's happening?

487
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I guess that was a Saturday Night Live skit about the importance of cowbell and rock and roll.

488
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And it just hit me while I was listening to that and I didn't have the headphones on before.

489
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And now I'm like, oh yeah, okay, it sounds like Saturday Night Live.

490
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So interesting how I haven't seen the skit but I can only imagine how fucked up Christopher Walken would look doing that.

491
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
He's probably some asshole record producer or some role that he would just fit perfectly so good at that.

492
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
See, while that was playing I was thinking of something else which I can't come up with right now.

493
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay, then I'm going to play two more bits for you.

494
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,000
This first one is from a new podcast called Northwestern Noise.

495
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And Northwestern Noise...

496
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,500
has, well, it's self-explanatory, but it's brand new and if you live in the northwestern region,

497
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,500
which I've learned is Seattle and Oregon, then this might be of interest for you because

498
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,500
there's some good local news for the northwestern region.

499
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If anybody out there isn't familiar with the Northwest, I'm sorry, I plead ignorance.

500
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Miacopa, the Northwest, is in the United States of America, encompassing the states of Oregon

501
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and Washington.

502
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I primarily have the called Oregon home.

503
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
My these past 23 years, I had a quick stint in Miami.

504
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I have some interesting stories to tell you from Miami to bring up.

505
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And I also have a musician, an artist that I won't play.

506
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Hold on a second, where's the news part? I thought I had to cut out.

507
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's not what I wanted you to hear. Hold on.

508
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Who hasn't?

509
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I played some short excerpts.

510
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'll cut out.

511
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Talk real quick about if you have a blog, this is so horrible.

512
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This is made by Hugo.

513
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
He can do anything.

514
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And they do Beaverton.

515
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Any programs these pot well I feel I feel shitty now because wait maybe it's

516
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Maybe it's after this

517
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:59,500
No, we have that bit. What happened to his northwest news yet to be born. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go

518
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Here we go still in womb

519
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Let me just rewind a little bit more because this is here's going into some news specific

520
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I got messed up. Hey, I'm doing this without a producer. I'm not used to that.

521
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You've never been there and you've never visited.

522
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay, he's going to talk about him out, same hell.

523
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay, here we go with Northwestern noise and the news.

524
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,000
1364 feet. That's amazing. Wiped out everything. All life for, I don't know, a large radius.

525
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And if you've never been there and you've never visited Mount St. Helens, it's in Washington.

526
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I forgot to mention that, sorry. If you haven't visited it, you should, but stay away right now because of these minor eruptions.

527
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But at the time, which is interesting, was I wasn't even born yet. I was still in womb, yet to be born.

528
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But I was, so I didn't get to see massive explosion and I guess I was unfortunate enough to miss the ash that covered the region like snow.

529
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Numerous people died because of the event.

530
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So it was very cataclysmic.

531
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
So it's still six in the mind of everybody here in the Northwest.

532
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
We all remember it if we were alive.

533
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,500
And so enough with the Mount St. Helens.

534
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Let's hope it doesn't explode.

535
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Okay.

536
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Well, that's a good thought for the day.

537
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Let's definitely hope it doesn't explode.

538
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,500
But, uh, so I missed it up there on the queue, but he really went into the whole

539
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
story about Mount St. Helens and give some background on it.

540
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,500
And I wouldn't have known this, you know, and so that apparently there's

541
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,500
been some minor earthquakes that have been registered and they're a little

542
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,500
bit worried about a repeat of what happened 25 years ago, which I do remember

543
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
because I was, I was 15.

544
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,500
So I do remember I was doing a lot of other things when I was 15, but was it

545
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:00,500
cataclysmic?

546
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I can't really remember.

547
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,500
I can't really remember if it was cataclysmic or how bad it was.

548
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,500
It just, it's, it's even too far back for me.

549
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I'm sure some, you know, if someone witnessed that and remembers that, you

550
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,500
know, record that, record that in a, in an mp3 file and point it to me or email it to

551
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
me, don't email it, mac.com still isn't working.

552
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but you know I'll find it somehow I'll aggregate it I hope and I wanted to leave

553
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
you with one last bid here for today what are we we're 40 minutes into it

554
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
digging this I still haven't taken my walk around and let's take a couple of

555
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
podcasts this is the new tech aura show tech aura.com and with little shout out

556
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
to me and played a song for me some good hillbilly shit-kicking music but

557
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm gonna let him set it up first Dave and Adam since we were talking about

558
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
also the fact that I've been working this you know solidify this system for

559
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
himself yeah my head put out another trade secrets put out another source quote

560
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
over the weekend and just it's just a kind of a funny little note Adam I have

561
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
one question for you how in the live in hell can you smoke as many bowls as

562
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
you do during a show especially for as long as you're up every day I mean I

563
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
would be going comatose maybe that's what's happening in the middle that you

564
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
go comatose. Oh dude dude dude I am comatose. Didn't you hear me cue up that last

565
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
bid? I am comatose.

566
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,500
those hours but it's so funny if you listen really really close when Dave

567
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:33,500
like in a trade secret when Dave is going off on his little diatrous sorry

568
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Dave you you do like to talk when he gets going and Adam's sitting there

569
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,500
listening and you can hear the you know the lighter going off in the background

570
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,500
I just think that's absolutely hilarious but so on my first music segue I've

571
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:54,500
got a little dedication actually this is this is a great band love them to death

572
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,500
and I think this one is going out to Adam Curry this this one's for you dude

573
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:08,500
because you just make me laugh

574
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hellcat's doing I like whiskey. Actually that was a demo song so the quality was a demo tape so the quality of that wasn't that great

575
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But awesome dude. Thank you very much for that and isn't it beautiful the way, you know, you can make a recording of

576
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
An mp3 and you just crank up the volume and it comes into my mp3 player and it's the same quality

577
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Fantastic, even though that was a demo clearly. It was awesome. Thank you. I appreciate that what a beautiful gift to receive

578
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And I just wanted to mention a couple things briefly about the iPod or developers list

579
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We still got some great momentum going with developers and users all over the place

580
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
There are a couple of off-list conversations, which is all good and I threw a question out there. I said look

581
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Where are we at with Windows and I got an answer back and probably more but as I've mentioned my email is just not working

582
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Apparently so I don't know if more has come back but there are two Windows clients that really seem to have the installation and

583
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
The

584
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,500
I'm going to start making some decisions on what we're going to promote here because I

585
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
want to put on the homepage for iPodder.org.

586
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,500
I basically want to have download and I want to have Mac which will more than likely be

587
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
iPod or X.

588
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Underneath that I want to put Windows with iTunes, Windows with media player and I want

589
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,500
to have one for each and then for other systems Linux, Pocket PC I think we have

590
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,500
and then I'll have links to other clients because I think there's a market here you

591
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,500
know and I don't want anyone to be disappointed.

592
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,500
I know a lot of people have given up the development of their scripts and saying

593
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
I know so I've put up my last changes I'm switching to this.

594
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:23,500
But I know that there's one or two projects out there that probably haven't gotten the attention they deserve just because I'm confused at this point about how much is going on and how many different projects there are.

595
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:29,500
And please just, you know, keep hammering me if I haven't put a link to your, your download page or whatever.

596
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,500
And I've put a couple more up today.

597
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:42,500
But there's a market here. There's a definite, definite market for developing iPod or functionality because it's, you know, you're talking about the organization and how stuff runs.

598
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:53,500
And when it runs and file management, and you're going to have users that in the exact same way as we did this together, they're going to want to talk with you and have you create something better.

599
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
And they're going to pay for it. They will. You know, it does work.

600
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,500
I pay for software all the time, not the only one. Clearly.

601
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:08,500
There are companies and small, you know, just developers by themselves who take PayPal payments for software they're making.

602
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,500
And there is a, there's totally a market for that. And I'll support, you know, anything. Just let me know what you do.

603
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
doing and I'll point to it and let's make something out of this industry.

604
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Same goes for, and no one has shown up for this yet except for the Audio Hijack Pro guys,

605
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
for how we're doing this.

606
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm using five different applications.

607
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I think there's an opportunity there and it's going to be big.

608
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
This is really going to be big.

609
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So looking forward to getting that information out there so we can get more of our Windows

610
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,500
proud and I'm going to leave it at that for today with the source codes for Tuesday, September

611
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,500
28th.

612
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,500
