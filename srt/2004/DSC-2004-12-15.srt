1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hey, what's up, everybody?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's just Karen.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And this is Junior Bitches from the Lunatic Radio.com show.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And you'll listen to Adam Curry on the daily source code podcast player.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You know, that dude with the fantastic hair from MTV.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, he was beautiful back then.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
How are you doing?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How are you doing?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey, everybody.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How are you doing?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome to your daily source code.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It is Wednesday, December 15, 2004 coming to you

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from Curry Cottage in the United Kingdom of the great

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
pile of Britain.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Something like that.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey, friends, family world leaders.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome to the Big Show.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I know the GM Pack Day, which puts me at recording the show

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
at 11 o'clock this evening.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I spent most of my time at Starbucks, though, as usual today.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But not doing a podcast.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I had a visitor from out of town.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This time it was Clark Boyd from WGBH in Boston.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You know, GBH, of course, from there.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Excellent morning stories podcast.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hold on a second.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I've seen a phone call here.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, wait a minute.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's my friend.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hey, Dave, how you doing?

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Good.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm in the middle of the source code.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I just started the show and you called.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I figured I'd pick up.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, why don't I call you back after the show?

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll just run through everything and you're going to be up for a while.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, that's right.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to be up for a while.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll call you in about an hour.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, man.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
See, now that would have been great if I had a way to actually

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
conference Dave in, clearly, that's up on his mind.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So anyway, it's your daily source code.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As I said, I had a visitor from WGBH in Boston today.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Clark Boyd also does a lot of shows that are co-produced with the BBC.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Actually, this morning I was at the BBC again.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This time it was for a program called mouse mat, which kind of makes me laugh,

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you know, because I guess I've always learned to say mouse pad

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
instead of mouse mat, but mouse mat works for me.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I actually have a mouse mat.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I use a like a Persian rug, a miniature Persian rug is my mouse pad.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I actually do have a mouse mat, a flying mouse mat.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Magic, flying mouse mat, I guess.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So what it happens is, you know, the BBC of course is in London,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and I'm not going to slip out to London.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So they have a BBC Southern Counties radio, which is located at the

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
University of Surrey.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Surrey.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Excuse me.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And so they've basically got a special little corner there,

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
where they have an ISDN set, and you sit there,

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and then the phone rings and the system picks up,

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and then you hear the London studio, and you've got a microphone

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and a headset, and you kind of have a conversation.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So that was fun.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then I picked up Clark at the train station.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
His train was on time, Clark work.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We went to, well of course, we went to Starbucks,

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and I downloaded and uploaded and showed him, you know,

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
basically the podcast set up.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's a techie.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He's a geekhead.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So he was totally into all the different wires and connectors

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that we've strung together to figure out how to make these podcasts.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So it was good.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Only, of course, it took a lot of time,

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and I did take the time, and I was happy to do it.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But, you know, so by the time I got home,

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and actually, I found out that there is gridlock traffic

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and gulford, if you're caught near the train station

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
around 536 o'clock, you're totally screwed.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Who knew there was gulford gridlock, but it's there.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It really is.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it took me a good while to get home,

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and I still had to get cat food.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So it's, again, life gets in the way of the art

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that we're trying to create here with the podcast.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Still have an excellent show lined up for you.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Tomorrow, by the way, is the day that Alfian Benson come home.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
These are the two cute little doggies

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that were stuck in limbo in Atlanta.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Locked.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The key soon to be thrown away.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Lee Wilkins and his lovely girlfriend Jenny, you know,

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
totally in despair.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now, the dogs are coming back tomorrow.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Totally 100% with the help of the podcast community,

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the daily source code.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I know it may not seem like a huge amount

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
in the world scale of things,

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but it was just beautiful to see how everyone came together.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And the doggies are coming back, and that is excellent.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And they'll still have to be in quarantine for six months,

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but at least, you know, they will be visitation rides.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Conjugal visits, maybe, anyone?

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey Adam, after hearing you ask people

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to donate some money, you get Alfian Benson back the UK.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to Alfian Benson.com

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and start to go to the old process of donating some money to them.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Unfortunately, I never did donate.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
After creating a PayPal account for my could tell,

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I would have to transfer money for my bank

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
or pay some sort of charge to enable my credit card

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to use that.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Either way, PayPal claimed that I would have to wait

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
three to four days, I think, to get money transferred over to them,

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
so I could use it online purchases or whatever.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They must have changed their policy

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
because I certainly recall setting up my first account.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I know even a European account, and I'm a verified European member.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There were that means.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It went pretty fast, as long as you can lay down a credit card.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But it's in light of all the scams that are going on,

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and there isn't a day that goes by that don't get the,

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
hey, you know, here at PayPal,

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
we just want to check and make sure that you're secure.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, click on this link.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Man, I hate those guys that do that.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Anyway, let's continue.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, I thought to myself, you know, by then,

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the money's part of me raised to help out Alvin Benson,

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
they're probably going to be on a plane back to England.

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, I've been trying to come up with a solution

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
that takes some ideas that I've heard you come up with

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
over the past few weeks,

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and, you know, build upon that,

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you know, I think we could help out the podcasting medium

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and help out people at the same time.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Basically, my idea is in the long run

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to have the podcast equivalent of public television,

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
like PBS.

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How about radio, like MPR?

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, you had the idea of taking a series of shows

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and grouping it together

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
on either one server or one XML fee,

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
something like that.

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, I think we could do that,

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and also combine that with a sound method

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
of raising some money.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Instead of doing your traditional marathon thing

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
that you see PBS do,

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
we could instead have a really cool online website

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that would,

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the primary thing would be to have as few barriers.

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I think we should auction off dates with dogs.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's possible to get people donate.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Support a lot more than just PayPal, you know?

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know what?

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I guarantee you we can do this.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I guarantee you, totally.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's a whole area that's wide open

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
for this kind of stuff in podcasts.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let me see.

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's the one thing you wanted to say.

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Just want to move on to that whole one.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You have a lot kind of thing.

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Go to go.

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Really made a big difference.

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know.

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What is it?

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's sort of a rainy day fund.

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll say that for a rainy day.

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry that you weren't able to get hooked up with PayPal Robert.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have to be honest.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have used PayPal,

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and I've used it for donation purposes.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And they take a pretty big vague on the stuff that you,

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
you know, that you send.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think in some cases like five or ten percent,

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
it's an amazing amount of money,

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
which seems like kind of, you know,

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
well,

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I guess it works on the really other micro payments.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And that's how it,

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
but the minute you get into like hundreds of dollars,

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
or even thousands of dollars,

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
it kind of starts to defeat the purpose with their fee,

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
that they take from the middle there.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I wanted to talk a little bit about,

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
well,

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
basically some stuff that's been coming down the pipe that people are talking to me about.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The first thing is the Heineken podcast.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Everyone has pointed out the Heineken podcast to me.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I just want to clarify,

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
maybe the posting that I put on my,

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
on my weblog.

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I know a lot of people at Heineken.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I met once or twice Freddie Heineken.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He's passed away now,

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Patricia my wife.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She is met Freddie Heineken many times.

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I think they actually got a long,

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
pretty well.

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He passed on about two or three years ago,

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
amazing guy.

211
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And fabulous company, Heineken.

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean, think about it.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What are they selling?

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You know, water,

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
selling water,

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
primarily water,

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and some other stuff thrown in there.

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So it's a great company.

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Family company,

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
been around for a long time.

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a great brand.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And they have kind of,

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've always felt they've had a bit of a

224
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
a virgin records or virgin brand kind of vibe to them.

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A lot of autonomy for local countries to advertise.

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And they can be pretty wacky and do wacky things.

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It comes up with creative great ideas.

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They usually make use of small advertising agencies.

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I knew some of the Heineken USA folks.

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Of course, I knew more of the Heineken folks in the Netherlands.

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And so when I heard Michael Butler of the Rockin' Old Geek Show,

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
who, of course, is a podcast pioneers.

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Been on the podcasting scene since I was,

234
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
since way back when in August.

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He's a Heineken fan.

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He's a Heineken fan.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He's a Heineiman all the way.

238
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's just no doubt about it.

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You look at his ID3 tags.

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He's a Heineken logo.

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You look at his podcast logo.

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's basically the Heineken logo with Rockin' Old Geek Show in it.

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And he loves the product.

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He really does.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And he had been trying to get a sponsorship.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I'd been listening and following along with the show where he called up Heineken.

247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He called up some Heineken office.

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And they were really nice about it.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But hey, basically we can't help you out.

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We can't do a sponsorship before.

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It only wants us just a case of Heineken.

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Right?

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So I put in a couple of calls to some of the smaller agencies.

254
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I know here on the Netherlands.

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I said, hey, dude, it would be so cool.

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Think of just this entire community will be up and,

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and applauding for Heineken.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If only you'll give this guy a case of beer a month or something.

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I just do something.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know, sponsoring some small,

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
for Heineken insignificant way.

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But it'll make a big deal of difference.

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And, you know, here's a very happy use of your product.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know, what more can I say?

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And by the way, a lot of people listen to him.

266
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And a lot of intelligent people.

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And a lot of, well, all kinds of people.

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And people who like to drink beer.

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I put the call in.

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And what I guess what came back.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, there is no such thing as coincidence.

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now there's a small agency for Heineken.

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That is creating a Heineken podcast.

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And it was a small agency for Heineken.

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That is creating a Heineken podcast.

276
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And it will besides the fact that you can't use Safari or

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
or internet explorer browser on a Macinton.

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, forget it.

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you're a Mac, you basically can't drink Heineken today.

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Which is very aggravating.

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The music is something totally different from what the rock and roll geek show is all about.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And it just looks kind of a, I don't know if it's 100% related.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But this thing is the shame.

284
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I put out a call to the, to anyone who's involved in Heineken.

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, we can, we can, we can make this even better than a Heineken podcast.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why doesn't Heineken underwrite one of the premier pioneer podcasters?

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And you already told you the price.

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You know, and of course, I'm a business man.

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So I want my bottle a month out of it.

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know, come on.

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know, the sun don't rise from nothing here.

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But please consider it.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How it's turned into a pretty good job when he,

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
when he promoted Heineken.

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is one way that the rock and roll geek could have done it.

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But I think he would do it differently.

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But what the heck, here's an exam.

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Heineken beer, baby.

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, man.

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh.

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh.

303
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh.

304
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh.

305
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh.

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh.

307
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh.

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Oh.

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh.

310
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh.

311
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh.

312
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh.

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh.

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh.

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh.

316
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh.

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh.

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This, by the way, is a part of my grandmaster plan.

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
David, I talk about this all the time.

320
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's happening right here.

321
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Wouldn't it, you know, all, you know, with podcasting,

322
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
people are going to skip past the commercials if you have advertisements.

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
News flash, revolutionary concept.

324
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's make the commercials interesting.

325
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So people will actually pay them and not play them and not get paid for it.

326
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah.

327
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah.

328
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come here, baby.

329
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah, come on.

330
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh.

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh.

332
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh.

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh.

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh.

336
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh.

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh.

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh.

339
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

340
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh.

341
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh.

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh.

343
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh.

344
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh.

345
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's orgasmic.

346
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh.

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh.

348
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh.

349
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh.

350
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh.

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh.

352
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh.

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh.

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay.

355
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, you get the point, right?

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So, hi, Nickon.

357
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on, man.

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's get that case over here.

359
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, yeah.

360
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And while we're talking about the rock and roll geek,

361
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
we might as well crank up some tunes by his band.

362
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
American Hardbreak.

363
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Here's bitch.

364
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So you got some bitch in a tube.

365
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's nothing new.

366
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
With you now fucking through.

367
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So you got your little Superman's.

368
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll be made up of thin my hands.

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Take your ways.

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's not about you.

371
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're threatening to run away.

372
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Hoping I beg you to stay.

373
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hold your breath.

374
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You're almost blue.

375
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Promotion nothing.

376
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
True to my word.

377
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm still here.

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're still working hard.

379
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Tell me your why.

380
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Tell me your why.

381
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Tell me your why.

382
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Tell me your why.

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Tell me your why.

384
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Tell me your why.

385
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Tell me your why.

386
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tell me your why.

387
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Tell me your why.

388
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why are you still hanging around?

389
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Tell me your why.

390
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Tell me your why.

391
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why are you still hanging around?

392
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So you got some bitch in a tube.

393
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's nothing new.

394
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
With you now fucking through.

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Promotion nothing.

396
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
True to my word.

397
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm still here.

398
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're still working hard.

399
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Tell me your why.

400
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Tell me your why.

401
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why are you still hanging around?

402
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Tell me your why?

403
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Tell me your why.

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why are you still hanging around?

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Tell me your why.

406
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Tell me your why.

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Tell me your why.

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:40,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, silloo, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

410
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,880
It's your daily source code a whole lot. I'm doing that drunken thing again once I don't know what it is

411
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,080
This is something that I'm seeing all over the place somehow when you're capturing audio on your Mac and Tosh

412
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,160
Eventually a delayed builds up and it's just like it's milliseconds, right?

413
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,560
But it doesn't matter what you're using. I happen to be using audio hijack pro, but actually an email was swirling around today

414
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,480
That it's still hard. It's we do not have good podcast software at all at all

415
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,880
We need to find something. There's a company out there called de let

416
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Dot let or dot some people pronounce a definitely dip the day let D-A-L-E-T and they make

417
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,420
Radio station software. It's PC based and just it runs on you know a regular PC

418
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:33,520
But it uses some extra hardware bits, but their interface is totally right for podcasting for making radio on

419
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,360
On a computer if they would make a like for a light version that would be you know a huge market sure

420
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:48,160
You know, they sell basically the big radio stations and big broadcast corporations, but I think a light version would be not only possible

421
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,400
That totally cool just one more thing about

422
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
American heartbreak

423
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,920
They're going on tour any day now not coming

424
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,640
Through the UK unfortunately. It's a very expensive country to tour in

425
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Especially considering that the pound is now about almost two dollars

426
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,840
So and you know, and yeah, they do spend a pound like a buck back home

427
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,340
Sure, milk may have kind of a similar value in price, but now not an easy place to tour

428
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,800
I know the guys are going through Rotterdam. I should check it out because

429
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,720
My plans have changed now as well mom got the call that she goes into the hospital on

430
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Sunday

431
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,560
So the 20th Monday the 20th is when the operation takes place

432
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,120
So my plans are shifting a bit. I'm of course going to go leave earlier

433
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,480
Which may mean that with some luck maybe somewhere around the

434
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,400
Love to find out after find it from Michael Butler when they're playing the playing in Rotterdam

435
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,960
They're playing in Berlin, so maybe I can catch a show that would be cool. Anyway, great song song there

436
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,240
Always happy to play American heartbreak on the show

437
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Just want to let you know that

438
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
Yes today as I was talking about the some of the OPML stuff

439
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
You know, I'm not the only person thinking about this good old

440
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:12,400
Drew from the Don and Drew show was all over it and he's sending me OPML files that contain the archives to all of the Don and Drew shows

441
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,320
Basically a placeholder so that his document will change whenever you want to take a look at

442
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,000
What's going on with Don and Drew for instance on the pod squad page

443
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,480
Or and this is what I tried from the iPod or directory you would basically have a you know

444
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
A live update

445
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,680
The OPML version works beautifully. I mean I can plug in anything I want

446
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,400
Unfortunately the directory doesn't want to eat that code so we kind of got to figure that out

447
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,480
But it's coming together. I feel I feel the vibe. I feel something happening with this OPML stuff

448
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,200
It's happening something's coming together. So if you saw a note of the directory break

449
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,240
horribly that was I was Drew and I'm mucking about trying to figure this out and

450
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:07,000
Also a couple of some contact with some of the iPod or developers who are also now trying to figure out you know where where can we

451
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,520
Pull this OPML in and you know, what are the consistent factors?

452
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,120
I've had the horrible habit of putting a title on top of my OPML files of my production show notes

453
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,200
Which basically is a directive that that makes a page render with the title being the title

454
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,320
But there's a hash sign which kind of screwed up some some stuff. I think for the for iPod or X

455
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,920
I'm sorry. I think was for the iPod or lemon team

456
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,680
So I'm still trying to figure that out one thing that I've started doing though is in the album

457
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
title

458
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,000
The album ID3 tag where normally I'd say you know here's what's on the show now

459
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm putting the URL in there to the

460
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,440
Production notes for that show to the OPML file so

461
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:04,520
Maybe that's something that you know that that some of the iPod are going to be able to suck out of there and and use and display is information

462
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:11,080
I don't know you can certainly test against my stuff and drew stuff and give us some feedback

463
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,280
You know, let us know and we'll also keep an eye on the the iPod developer list

464
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,640
Is this great? I mean drew a such a nice guy

465
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,360
You know he's working with me on this and he's letting me totally fool around with his wife. It's great

466
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm such a lucky bastard

467
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,040
Adam this is Chuck Tomasi of Chuckchat.com. I'm a long time listener first time podcaster

468
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,120
Just wanted to pass on a little feedback and thanks regarding all your pontification about RSS and podcasting

469
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,760
As in the UK a couple of weeks ago on business but due to terrible scheduling distance and in person visit was out of the question

470
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,840
Would have been great to catch up with one of the podfathers of podcasting

471
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
I've been living in Scotland near Edinburgh

472
00:22:53,560 --> 00:23:00,040
It was funny noticing a lot of the things you were talking about in recent weeks on your podcast things like the large power plugs with switches next to them

473
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,640
The pop-in light bulbs in the lamps and so forth. I haven't got a chance to do some driving on the left side of the road using

474
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,920
Manual transmission

475
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,040
It's like having all your clothes on backwards and trying to right with the opposite hand very strange

476
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,240
I kind of cheated with my opportunity to drive because it was 2 a.m. and there wasn't anybody out on at that time on Friday morning

477
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
But it was the safest way for me

478
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,800
Even inspired me to create my own podcast which I've called Chuckchat

479
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,800
Hopefully you've got your broadband by the time you get this. Thank you for a wonderful show

480
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,080
And keep up the good work. Thank you everybody. Oh, hold on. Hey, let's hear it for Adam

481
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
It was more to the message. Thank you, Chuck

482
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Okay, no, I don't have my broadband yet. No, sorry Bob. I don't have my broadband

483
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,360
I was actually going to read an article that a couple of people pointed me to about

484
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,520
Britain's digital diet

485
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,880
Actually I posted the link and see it was at Craig Patchett who who sent me this link

486
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,800
Basically people in the UK are carrying around an enormous amount of data. I'm sure it's the same in the states as well

487
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,280
But hey, you know, it's a it's a BBC story so

488
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,760
They're gonna talk about the UK in this case, but instead of that I'd like to read another story

489
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
I would read you a story kids

490
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,240
Um

491
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,440
The first person who pointed this out to me was Ross Jones

492
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,720
Ross has been all over my bandwidth situation. This is from the register

493
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I written by Tim Richardson published

494
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,520
Tuesday

495
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
December 14th, 2004

496
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
In the evening

497
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm sorry, 11 48 in the morning

498
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,880
Grinch me time. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna read this to you because this is it's it's so typical. It's so beautiful

499
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
titled gilford runs out of broadband

500
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,560
Sudden surge in demand for DSL broadband and gilford has left BT that's British telecom

501
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,840
On the hop and net users twiddling their thumbs waiting for high speed net access

502
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,680
BT wholesale which provides DSL that is resold by ISPs such as AOL UK

503
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,320
Tiscally and want to do UK has confirmed that all capacity at its gilford telephonic change has been used up

504
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:29,720
New DSL broadband customers in the affluent Surrey town must wait until BT installs extra capacity in its exchange

505
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,360
The UK giant telco says this should come on stream by the end of this week

506
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,360
News that gilford had quote run out of broadband was contained in a blog by Adam Curry a mover and

507
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,360
Shaker and podcasting in essence radio broadcasts for MP3 players on December 3rd he wrote

508
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,400
I just got off the phone with British telecom who informed me that there are no ports available at my exchange and

509
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,520
Someone would have to leave before one becomes available. Yes, there is a waiting list and know

510
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,080
They can't tell me where I am on the list since it's sold out to multiple ISPs

511
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,920
A spokesman for BT acknowledged that all the available broadband connections in gilford had been used up

512
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,040
But denied that new users would have to wait until someone dropped off before being hooked up

513
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,720
He told the register quote we do have people so I do the accent. Yeah, I think so

514
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,600
We do have people waiting on that exchange the capacity has been reached but new lines will be installed this week

515
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,880
The situation was not ideal he added but it was not typical of what is going on

516
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,880
gilford was hit by a sudden surge in demand

517
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,560
BT was also unable to say for how long the exchange has been full

518
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,560
11 days at least according to curie or how many people are on the waiting list for broadband

519
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,960
Excellent

520
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,680
Excellent reporting thank you very much Tim Tim good job Tim Richardson and full of shit

521
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
By this week you're right

522
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
You're right

523
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,800
Of course I just went through all the trouble of canceling the other ISP

524
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,440
You okay online. I come on. It's not true. I can't believe it

525
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,640
But you know what we got their attention and that's what counts and I really appreciate it and

526
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,280
They will know that pod casten has come to town everybody

527
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
more on bandwidth

528
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,800
today if you

529
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,440
looked at the RSS file you'll see that

530
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,920
The daily source code was not coming from the server we've been using for the past couple of weeks

531
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
which was

532
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,960
The server at opml.org atom.opml.org

533
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,600
This is a test and the reason is that we've seen that you know there's basically something

534
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
going wrong in the network

535
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,560
now that the amount of subscribers has increased significantly

536
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,040
And downloads are breaking probably primarily

537
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,240
downloads that are done by automatic iPod or clients

538
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,800
It seems that people are having better luck with

539
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,320
with their browsers downloading browsers but that kind of defeats the whole point of iPod or

540
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,040
Anyway, you can see the post things we've pointed to it in the production show notes and in a on my

541
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,240
on my weblogg davis

542
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,680
Really it started up you know it was great started this

543
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,000
Technical focus group on scripting news to you know see if we could

544
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,160
Basically track down the issue white it was breaking for for people and

545
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,080
And we're pretty sure it's it's the bandwidth that

546
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,800
We're being provided but we're not 100% sure so let's see what the results are

547
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,640
If we put it on an older server that well worked but we don't know if it's going to work with this type of volume

548
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,680
So it could be a total disaster you may not be hearing this show at all this show may have been lost in in bid hell

549
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,560
Maybe bit torrent is is where we're going to where it's all going to come down to

550
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,880
I think it's got to be there pretty soon because otherwise

551
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,840
You know, I'm not going to be the only one that's going to have this problem. I hope not

552
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,800
Let's see what are we at now pretty good about 30 minutes perfect. I wanted to play something that Tony Khan

553
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,600
Morning stories podcaster and by the way, have you noticed that morning stories is is changing

554
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,640
Where it used to be just morning stories with an intro by Tony now is the intro by Tony

555
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,960
You get the morning story and then there's like a whole kind of crew there, you know

556
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,520
It's like it's the Tony Khan crew zoo with WGV age and it's nice to hear you know

557
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,720
There's some good banter going on. There's some good shoot in the shit which is not your traditional MPR

558
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,040
Style I guess and I'm really enjoying that more of that, please more of that

559
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,800
And Tony did a conference recently. He spoke at a conference at Gisperkman at Harvard and

560
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,560
And he put together a sampler

561
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,840
On force I didn't see see the conference I couldn't listen to it. I didn't I think it was webcast

562
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,320
But obviously my continuing lack of broadband is not allowed me to

563
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,520
To download that I think I hope maybe there's a podcast that I can still subscribe to to get all of the sessions from that up to hunt around

564
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,120
But he put together this sampler which he gave me access to and I was like

565
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,720
It was so nice to hear a whole bunch of different voices and some of the stuff from earlier days of podcasting

566
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,840
I just wanted to replay this. There's a lot of me in it, which is not the reason I'm playing it

567
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,400
But really it's just a it's a nice flow and it's it's a whole bunch of voices that you'll recognize immediately and it's

568
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,920
It's nice and I want you to hear it's about four and a half about five minutes, but worth a listen

569
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
This thing on 30 seconds

570
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,840

Hi, I'm Todd Mappin. Thanks for tuning into the iLive Radio.org podcast today

We are coming to you from Burgerling, Germany and my goal today is to find the wall or

601
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
What's left of the Berlin wall anyway

602
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,320
Spent Saturday night. It's been night with about 500 other geeks

603
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Waiting in life in the new Nintendo DS

604
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,760
Something else that might surprise you people in smaller towns near St. Louis say

605
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,800
They stands again from the negative publicity. I'll tell you what they're talking about coming up tonight on holiday news at six

606

Welcome to real reviews films worth watching on Michael Gohagan today

607
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,720
We're gonna talk about a fun film

608
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:38,440
1999 the Limey it is directed by Steven Soderberg one of my favorite directors and it stars a great cast

609
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,280
Terence stamp plays the kind of title character Dave Wilson. I think if we as sex right now

610
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,360
It would give us a good rating right on the show

611
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,000
I think we should good thing this isn't a video show

612
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Make up make up

613
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:07,800
I don't understand why keep having to leave this is your show then you need to be writing down topics because I have topics another topic we were gonna talk about was gonna be

614
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,920
Frontline on PBS last night about how Walmart's destroying the world. I mean this was something that you were so interested

615
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm not gonna ring my hands over this election if nine eleven had never happened

616
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,560
John Kerry would be present in elect today. I have no doubt about that

617
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,440
Jim goes on Jim Gary

618
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,320
I'm still shaking my head over this a new democratic slogan in the 2006 midterm

619
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,760
quote you would vote for us if nine eleven hadn't happened

620
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,760
Your spit is hanging and you have a fight because it's for democracy and yet when we have democracy

621
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,880
You don't support him you would join your two because he's not doing what you want him to

622
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,480
He's not even if you like he want him to and become that because of that because of that

623
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
You commit a coup d'etat

624
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,200
I want to tell people the boycott wall

625
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,160
It's the only choice because they don't have everyone else out of business. Well

626
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah, but I don't even think there was anything in there being with Chris. They still have downtown

627
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,840
It was shitty and it was she before Walmart came. It was shitty after Walmart came. I wrote on the text weblog about this

628
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,000
Thanksgiving episode of WGBH morning stories

629
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,120
I thought was fantastic. He'd been blacklisted and knew he'd never see another paycheck

630
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,640
Unless he cooperated with a committee recanted his views and informed on all his friends

631
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,800
Instead that Thanksgiving he invited them all to a feast with

632
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,000
We can't just a really dark period in American history, you know

633
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,920
That's uh people think of that and it's kind of housey in time

634
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,240
There's like a 10 15-year period where we locked up the Japanese because of their ethnicity

635
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,680
We you know the whole house on American activities thing there was a lot of horrible shit going on back then as

636
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,600
There is today by the way

637
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,160
I guess eventually people will try to figure out how to make money on this

638
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,320
If I gave you five dollars could I be your first commercial commercial person sure? I could say

639
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,520
No, you can't see anything. It's 25 dollars. We might eventually have a sponsor or do a quick review of a product and you know

640
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,360
We'll always tell you exactly if it's a advertised men or something we like

641
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm still drinking honey. I love the product whether they give me free beer or money or not

642
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:24,040
I'll still drink that product so I found out today that there's a rating system for podcasts

643
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
So you guys go there and vote

644
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,640
Yeah, so we can be number one and take over the world and you will be my first lieutenant

645
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360

I understand you're picking through somebody else's garbage. I understand that

661
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
It's not the human

662
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
It's a it's part of community

663
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,240
It's a community. That's neat. You can go sit in a field and eat carrots and share your open source

664
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
We got to make money

665
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,560
That's all I'm saying. I love it. Oh my god

666
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,960

00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,600
Okay, the show just keeps getting better and better keep it up Butler. Huh. Thanks dude

673
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,680
I don't think it's getting better, but I appreciate the nice words and it gives me the

674
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,560
Cards to keep going on with this thing. I'm having such a blast doing this

675
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,000
I've been really fortunate and the fact that I've got so many listeners just tells me that some people are enjoying it

676
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,920
And I can't tell you how gratifying that is. See you then mentioned our podcast and we have popped up in there

677
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Yeah, someone that me 10 dollars that podcasting wouldn't be around next year. I don't really want to

678
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,880
Wow cuisine. I'm learning how to speak Spanish. I am

679
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,440
Learning the incident. There was a an article in the London Times podcast in the next big thing

680
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
You've always wanted to be star

681
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,520
It's my job

682
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,880
To make you a star

683
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,320
somehow you have a good ability to communicate a lot of geeks can't communicate. I know what I'm ready to what

684
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,920
This is an easy way to do it. I don't see the other people. I can't see the other people. I can't see any of it.

685
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,720
And I think that the BBC is doing more podcasting experiments than we're aware of

686
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,000
Andrew Whitehurst sent me an email also and I'll just like you.

687
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:22,040
Like the day you walked into my life. So unmistakably like every other woman. It's so different in so many other ways

688
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,280
And you well, you were my second choice. I love you, baby

689
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,040
Well, I'm going to wrap this up. Do you want to say hi to everybody?

690
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Say it right here. I like my mom. Say bye bye.

691
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,880
Bye bye. All right, everybody. Good night. It's late. We're tired. We're going to go watch a movie

692
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:49,240
later. Can I ink on it? Take these everybody. I'll see you. Thanks for listening. Thanks for

00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,640
subscribing, y'all. Bye bye. The source code can be found in its archives later. Show and the podcast

RSS feed and daily source code dot com. I'll check you out tomorrow everybody. Take care.

695
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,800
How amazing was that? Let me just turn this down for a second. That's the end. Hold on a second.

696
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,600
Oh man. Wow. I apologize. It wasn't five minutes. It was 10 and a half minutes.

697
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:25,960
That was really good. And I remember so many of those moments. It's only in, yeah,

698
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:33,320
Jesus man. This is good shit. This is really cool. And it went long so I'm not going to be able

699
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,960
to talk about the I River hack that I wanted to, but that of course will be here tomorrow.

700
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,560
Because I got some interesting news about the I River after my review from yesterday.

701
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,040
Wow. I'm going to actually listen to that podcast thing again. It was more than just a

702
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,080
sample. This had a whole flow to it. I mean, it was, it was a little bit of history in there as well.

703
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:01,960
Excellent job. I'm sure Rick had something to do with it. I'm sure the Tony has,

704
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:08,600
has his, uh, it's got his team working on that stuff. Man, what an amazing, amazing amount of work.

705
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,160
Okay. Perfect time. 42 minutes. Going to leave it at that for today. I started a

706
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,560
phone call to make today. You know that. So I'll be back tomorrow for the Thursday edition

707
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,400
of the Daily Source Code and we'll be learning about hacking our I River. So you can always

708
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,360
send me email about that if you've got more on the topic. Add them at curie.com. Send

709
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,400
