00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Hi everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code for Monday. It is October 18th, 2004.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Coming to you in my bathrobes, sick as a dog. I'm Adam Curry with your daily source code.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:35,440
Oh man, it's been just a horrible weekend. I came down with what was supposed to be just a little bit of

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,000
the sniffles and a little bit of sore throat and is now a Monday, a Monday afternoon, 10 minutes to three.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,960
I've seen more of my bed in the past three days and I haven't had the past three months of

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,280
developing iPod or stuff. But the show must go on. So I've got all my prep that I did over the week

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
and I've got it lined up for you. I'm just not going to have the same amount of energy as I had as I normally

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,480
would have had and would have liked to project. So while I've been lounging around sweating and

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,040
visiting the bathroom quite frequently, Patricia continues to dismantle the entire house around me.

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
I walked upstairs. I was going to get something out of the bathroom upstairs and they're like three

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,160
guys there. She's something furniture we don't want. She's getting rid of all kinds of stuff. This is

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,120
really a big, a big life change that we're making here. Even the piano we're getting rid of that.

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,840
I granted no one has played on it for the past year and a half, but we're just really removing

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,840
a lot of the stuff that we don't need anymore. Okay, let's get everything rolling for today. I need

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,800
a song to kind of, you know, get the energy up and I figured nothing like the Spencer Davis group

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
to get your running. Give me some 11 on the daily source. Go!

17
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,440
One time we got a time to come up to the floor. Crazy people walking up the floor to the floor.

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,240
I mean, baby, I don't know what you got. Get your power to take it easy. Just run around.

19
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,680
So you have to make it. So you have to make it. You have to make it. You have to make it.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,440
You have to. Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more.

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,240
Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more.

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more.

23
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:52,240
Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more.

24
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more. Give me some more.

25
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,240
Is it just me or do I remember that song being longer? There's not even three minutes.

26
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Spencer Davis group. Give me some 11 here on the source code for Monday, October 18th, 2004.

27
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,840
I was just looking through my mail. I got some cool stuff I want you to hear.

28
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,360
And I have about 10 or 12 clips all lined up for you that I prepped over the weekend.

29
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,720
One of the things that I wanted to talk about. But I'm going to talk a little bit less than usual today.

30
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,640
Was about music licensing. That's something that came up that a lot of people have been talking about.

31
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,640
And hopefully we'll get a good discussion going at BloggerCon on November 6.

32
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,640
But of course, what's great about these podcasts is you don't have to use music.

33
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,640
You can use music that is independent music, which you can use royalty free.

34
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,640
There's actually now a indie music node in the directory at ipodder.org, which is just popped up.

35
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,640
What's so cool about that is the music node is already maintained by someone else.

36
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,640
And he's now delegating sub-directories of that.

37
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,640
So we're really rocking on the opml directory at ipodder.org.

38
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:43,640
But you can always leave it up to our buddy Pete from rasterweb to come up with exactly what you need when you're looking for royalty free music.

39
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Welcome to the rasterweb.

40
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,640
So it's used up for 10-15 late in the evening.

41
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,640
You know, I realized that this podcast thing is pretty cool.

42
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,640
But I don't think there's a theme song yet.

43
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I mean, I run this play in this music that they may or may not have the rights to.

44
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,640
But I got a song here and you can do it too long.

45
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,640
They mash it up, smash it up, delete it, play in the podcast.

46
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
I don't care. You're free to do it.

47
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
With it, what you will.

48
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
So there you go. Enjoy.

49
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Podcast End.

50
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Podcast End.

51
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Podcast End.

52
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Podcast End, baby.

53
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Yeah. Yeah, baby.

54
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
A new entry with a bullet.

55
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Okay, that's the podcast end song by me.

56
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I own the rights and I'm giving it away so you can do it too long.

57
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Thank you.

58
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Thank you very much.

59
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Rasterweb audio for that generous gift that you've given to the podcast and community.

60
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Something new that we set up is the last 100 podcast.

61
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,640
You can get to it from the from the left hand menu on ipod.org.

62
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
And this is really phenomenal.

63
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Anything that's listed in the directory automatically when there's a new podcast available.

64
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,640
It'll show up on this top one on this last 100 list.

65
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,640
And it shows up and they really trick this out.

66
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
I mean, it's just the beginning, but already I'm loving it so much.

67
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,640
You can click on it to download the show directly if you want.

68
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,640
You can subscribe the RSS link is there.

69
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,640
And if you mouse over the name of the show, it'll also give you all the comments that were attached to that podcast.

70
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,640
When it was put up on on the podcast feed.

71
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
So definitely check that out.

72
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I mean, I've been laying in bed just listening to podcast after podcast.

73
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Sitting here sweating away.

74
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,640
And it's weird, you know, because you drift off into sleep and you wake up again.

75
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,640
And I had my iPod just run in a continuous loop through everything.

76
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,640
So at one point I'm hearing Drew and Dawn and Drew talk about me.

77
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,640
And then I something called replay radio popped up.

78
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I don't know where that came from.

79
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I'm sure I subscribed to it somewhere.

80
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,640
And I could hear the third and final presidential debate.

81
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
It was, it was just an amazing experience.

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,640
But all these voices running through my head, man, is pretty trippy.

83
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Hey Adam, I just wanted to respond to something you said on Thursday's podcast about Australian radio.

84
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
You said you thought Aussie must be starved for good radio,

85
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
and that you'd probably only be able to get reception in the cities.

86
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,640
But Australia has one of the coolest radio stations in the world called Triple J,

87
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
which is broadcast to about 95% of the country,

88
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
which is pretty damn impressive given the isolation of some parts of us.

89
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,640
It's a really excellent nationwide non-commercial music station,

90
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,640
which stays well clear of the top 40 generica.

91
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,640
When I moved to the UK a few years back, the loss of Triple J was seriously one of my major concerns.

92
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
It's just such a great station.

93
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:30,640
You can read all about it at www.abc.net.au slash TRIPLJ.

94
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,640
And you can listen to live streams, or download some archive shows,

95
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,640
including some episodes of the J files, which is a semi-regular biography on a particular band,

96
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
or artist, which would make a really cool podcast, actually.

97
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Anyway, just wanted to set the record straight about Aussie radio there.

98
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Something else while I've got you, as a concerned world citizen,

99
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I've been watching the US election cycle with great anticipation,

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
and downloading the debate videos, but aren't because the broadcast here

101
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
was some stupid time in the morning.

102
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
I was wondering if you knew about the fact that the Guardian,

103
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,640
which is one of the UK's broadsheet newspapers,

104
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
is running a program where they're hooking up UK residents

105
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,640
with the residents of Ohio, one of the crucial undecided states.

106
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,640
So we can write to these guys and let them know all our concerns about Bush.

107
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm kind of sketchy about whether you agree with it from a privacy or moral perspective,

108
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
sort of trying to influence their election this way,

109
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
but very interesting idea anyway.

110
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,640
You can check that one out at www.gardian.co.uk slash Clark County, or one word.

111
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Okay, well, great job with the Daily Source Code.

112
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
By the way, what is the verb when you're recording a voice message like this?

113
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm not rushing, I'm not emailing or calling.

114
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
What is it that I'm doing?

115
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Okay, see ya.

116
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
That's a very good question.

117
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
What is it?

118
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I thought this morning I was put casting instead of podcasting,

119
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
so I'm not sure what this is.

120
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,640
It's audio comment, I guess, that's the closest thing.

121
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Interesting intel, though, about the Guardian's doing,

122
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
and also about Aussie radio.

123
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I had no idea, and I apologize,

124
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,640
but still clearly not enough because there's so many podcasts coming out of Australia.

125
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
It's unreal.

126
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
And I also got something.

127
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I haven't listened to this yet myself,

128
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,640
so we're going to witness this together for the first time.

129
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I have a lot of buddies in the radio business in the States.

130
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,640
And one of my dearest old friends is Dave Fox.

131
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,640
He works for Clear Channel, actually.

132
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,640
And I've used him for a number of radio and television projects,

133
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,640
because he has the greatest voice you can imagine.

134
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
And so I sent him a brief note about podcasting,

135
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,640
and I just received an email with seven different files.

136
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I'm only going to play one.

137
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Let's just see what it winds up.

138
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Let's see how this sounds.

139
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Because I asked him to help me dress up the show a little bit with some sweepers and sounds.

140
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:10,640
podcasting, all's live, Adam Curry.

141
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I hear this rumors on the internet.

142
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I hear this rumors on the internet.

143
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I hear this rumors on the internet.

144
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Internet, internet.

145
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Internet.

146
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Internet.

147
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Internet.

148
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Internet.

149
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
To be the old B.G.Y.A.A.

150
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
and as our neighborhood practice there,

151
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,640
they're loved with women all across this country.

152
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Everyone wants to see their exaggerations.

153
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Well Tony Flare were going along.

154
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
The truth of the matter is if you listen carefully,

155
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
said, I'm a stupid power if you were the President of the United States,

156
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
and the world would be a lot better off.

157
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Not Tony Flare.

158
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,640
You cannot leave.

159
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,640
If you send me some messages.

160
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I actually forgot my own.

161
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm trying to solve all these bad things.

162
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm trying to solve what he means at solving.

163
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:28,640
If you're a, you're a, you've been given a sovereignty and you're, you're a sovereign entity.

164
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Well, don't you allow or go on along?

165
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
My enemies are innovative and resourceful.

166
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
And so are we.

167
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,640
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and other people.

168
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
And either do we.

169
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Feed people are not allowed to exercise the, the rights as human beings.

170
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I cannot lead.

171
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I, I, you cannot lead.

172
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,640
If you send an excellent, mixed messages.

173
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
This word dictates your ship.

174
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
It'd be a head of a lot easier.

175
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Just so long as I'm addicted.

176
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,640
I hear this rumors on the, uh,

177
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet, Internet.

178
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
There's been a whole saying in Tennessee.

179
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I know it's in Texas, probably Tennessee, but there's a fool me wants.

180
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Shame on you.

181
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Shame on you.

182
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
If fool me, can't get fool again.

183
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Wow.

184
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Another Bushism's, uh, found through the blog digger media feed.

185
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:43,640
And I have to say, uh, I think that if, uh, if we as a country elects a president,

186
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,640
who speaks of the Internet,

187
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
we got a serious problem.

188
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Come on.

189
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I mean, that, that wasn't just a mispronunciation.

190
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.

191
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
All in the Internet.

192
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Damn.

193
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
That's really bad.

194
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Vote for John Kerry.

195
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
It's Adam Curry.

196
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Adam Curry.

197
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Wow.

198
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,640
And now, another audio comment.

199
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,640
An audio blog posting, a new show.

200
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Out of Deutsch, minor-dumb and heron.

201
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Their podcasting is reaching from country to country.

202
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
It is everywhere now.

203
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
It is a rage.

204
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
They're going crazy.

205
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Come and see it.

206
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
I'm my friends.

207
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
With an podcast as Deutschlands.

208
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
So hello, everybody.

209
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Welcome to my audio blog, uh, or podcast.

210
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Whatever you think it's the right term for it.

211
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
This is my first English edition.

212
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Maybe the last, um, just waiting for the feedback.

213
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Um, first of all, the background music.

214
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
You hear it.

215
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
That's a DJ Machitos.

216
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Uh, the album is called Happy Trends.

217
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,640
And it's from www.magnature.com.

218
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,640
So I just wanted to give you a little, uh, little preview of what's happening overseas.

219
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Because we're not only in Australia.

220
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Now we're podcasting from Germany as well.

221
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,640
If you go to the ipotter.org directory, you can go to languages.

222
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,640
And there's, uh, I think there's German, Italian.

223
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,640
And, uh, we actually have, uh, someone maintaining the German node now.

224
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
It's, uh, it's great.

225
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,640
And if you want to hear some really different music for sure, go and check out, uh,

226
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,640
uh, the, uh, the German directory on ipotter.org.

227
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Okay.

228
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I got to let you know that I'm working on something.

229
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,640
And I just, excuse me, I'm just going to check an email here for one second.

230
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Um, here it is.

231
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Let me see.

232
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
I deal with this Asian old friend.

233
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
So I think I just made it.

234
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Right.

235
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Okay.

236
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,640
It looks like I'm going to get John Stewart on the podcast.

237
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Uh, working on it.

238
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
I think it's all kind of like buddy buddy stuff.

239
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
So I've put in a couple of calls.

240
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,640
And, and do you think John Stewart could be any hotter at the moment.

241
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Certainly, uh, in the blogosphere.

242
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Everybody's talking about his appearance on CNN.

243
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
If you haven't heard it, here's just a little bit where,

244
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
it's not funny.

245
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
You know, he's not trying to be funny.

246
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
And he's, and he's spanking these guys on crossfire.

247
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
And he's saying, you know, he's basically like, fuck you.

248
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
You guys are not doing your job.

249
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
What is wrong with you?

250
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Well, I'm just saying there's no reason for you.

251
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,640
And you have this marvelous opportunity not to be the guy's butt boy.

252
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
To go ahead and be his butt boy.

253
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Yes.

254
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
No.

255
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
I was absolutely his butt boy.

256
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
I was so far.

257
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
You would not believe what he ate two weeks ago.

258
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
You know, the interesting thing that I have.

259
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
You have a responsibility to the public discourse.

260
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
And you fail.

261
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
You fail.

262
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
You fail.

263
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I think.

264
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
You need to go to one.

265
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
The thing that I want to say is, when you have people on for just knee jerk,

266
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
reactionary talk.

267
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Well, I thought you were going to be funny.

268
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Come on.

269
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Be funny.

270
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
No.

271
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm not going to be your monkey.

272
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
What?

273
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
What?

274
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I want your show every day.

275
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
And it kills me.

276
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
I could tell you a lot about that.

277
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
It's so, oh, it's so painful to watch.

278
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,640
You know, because we need what you do.

279
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,640
This is such a great opportunity you have here to actually get politicians.

280
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
It's really just awesome.

281
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Of their marketing and strategy.

282
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah.

283
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
You know, someone who watches your show and cannot take it anymore.

284
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
I just can't.

285
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
It's like they've dinner with you.

286
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
It must be excruciating.

287
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Do you like lecture people like this?

288
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
When you come over their house and sit and lecture them.

289
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
You know, they're not doing the right thing that they're missing their opportunities

290
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
of fading their responsibilities.

291
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
If I think they are.

292
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
What?

293
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
I wouldn't want to eat with you, man.

294
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
That's horrible.

295
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,640
I know.

296
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
And you won't.

297
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
But the thing I want to get to.

298
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
You promised naked pictures of this.

299
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Yeah, we did.

300
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Let's get to those.

301
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Why can't we just talk?

302
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Please.

303
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
I beg of you guys.

304
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
I think you want to touch Crossfire.

305
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
We're going to take it quick.

306
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
We're going to hold that.

307
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
We've got commercials.

308
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Please.

309
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Next.

310
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Stop.

311
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
In the rapid fire.

312
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Please.

313
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
We hope.

314
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Thank you.

315
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
And that.

316
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,640
If you haven't heard or seen the entire appearance of John Stuart,

317
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Nate on CNN's Crossfire, definitely just Google it.

318
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Because everyone has links to the audio and there's bit-torn to the video files.

319
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
And he really, really pointed some stuff out.

320
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
And the blogger's fear is just on fire.

321
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Everyone's saying, yeah.

322
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
This is exactly what someone needed to say.

323
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
And maybe it's typical that that comes from a comedian.

324
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Maybe it is.

325
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Anyway, so looking forward to getting him on the source code in the coming week.

326
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I'm going to put my calls in.

327
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
You never know.

328
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Hi Adam.

329
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
My name is Mark.

330
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
And I'm sending in this comment to ask your opinion on something.

331
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,640
During one of your shows, I believe it was one of the trade secrets.

332
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,640
It was said that gosh, we're worried that if Bush were reelected,

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
North Korea would be the next domino to fall.

334
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,640
And we'd have a war against them that would involve nuclear weapons.

335
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
That sounds like a pretty good fear to me.

336
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
A pretty reasonable one.

337
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640
My question is, what happens if Kerry is elected instead?

338
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,640
North Korea is still a threat?

339
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Yes or no?

340
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
What do we do about that?

341
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
What do you think they'll do?

342
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
I'd love to hear your opinion.

343
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Thanks for putting on a great show.

344
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Thank you for your question, Mark.

345
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Actually, he's another person I can get on the source code.

346
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm sure he do it.

347
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:07,640
My uncle Donald Greg, who was a security advisor to Bush Senior when he was a vice president.

348
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,640
And yeah, exactly.

349
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I come from an interesting background.

350
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,640
He is, for a number of years now, has been the chairman of the Korean Society.

351
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
I think it's a Korea Society, Korea Society.org.

352
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Oh, let me just move my microphone on a little bit, so I don't sound so muffled.

353
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
And I've been talking to him.

354
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,640
I've also seen him on CNN a couple of times talking about North Korea and the talks that, well,

355
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
basically, the talks had just, you know, were broken off.

356
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I think if we, when we elect John Kerry, that these talks can resume because really all the North Koreans want is respect.

357
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,640
That's, I think, all that it's about.

358
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Particularly when the access of evil statement came out,

359
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,640
North Korea was listed right there on the access.

360
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
You know, that was a bad message.

361
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I think that, and from everything that I've heard from my uncle, we can repair the relations.

362
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,640
It's just a matter of showing respect and showing it pretty damn soon.

363
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
So, what are we, man?

364
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

365
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
It's heat no.

366
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Okay, let's play a sappy song on the source code.

367
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,640
If you're sick, it'll make you feel better.

368
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Or maybe even groovy.

369
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,640
The central part is Simon and Garfunkel on the source code.

370
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

371
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

372
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

373
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

374
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

375
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

376
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

377
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

378
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

379
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

380
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

381
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
We're only like two weeks away from election.

382
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,640
I, I feel a lower than am.

383
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
I got no beats to do, no promises to keep.

384
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm devil and just hit, ready to sleep at the morning time.

385
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Drubb js It's Meadows on me.

386
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Life, I love you.

387
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Uh, whoops. What happened there? Okay, let me see, was that the damn I totally sucks.

388
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Oh man. Well, let's play it back up song then. God damn. So what you get from ripping shit off the internet, huh?

389
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Let me buy that. Here's the clash.

390
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Music

391
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Nothing to call back to the faraway towns. Now war is declared.

392
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,640
I back will come down. Nothing to call into the unknown.

393
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Come out of the cupboard. Your boys and girls. Nothing to call in.

394
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Darling, I don't look that out

395
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
He beat a maniac, he's beating the task

396
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Let me look, darling, see we ain't got no swing

397
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Except for the rain

398
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
And the trenches thing

399
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
The ice is coming

400
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
The sun's over there

401
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Melted out, expected

402
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
The weed is for live

403
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
And just stop on it

404
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
But I have no fear

405
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Cause I'm done, it's out and I

406
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Live by the river

407
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
To the imitation zone

408
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
To get it brought up

409
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Because you're going alone

410
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Nothing will call it

411
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
To the zombies of death

412
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,640
Quit holding out

413
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
And drawing out the breath

414
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Nothing will call it

415
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
And I don't want a chance

416
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
But why we were talking

417
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
I saw you not in hell

418
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Nothing will call it

419
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
See we ain't got no hide

420
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Except for that one

421
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
But the yellow we are

422
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
The ice is coming

423
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
The sun's over there

424
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
And just stop on it

425
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
The weed is for live

426
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
And just stop on it

427
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
But I have no fear

428
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Cause I'm done, it's out and I

429
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Live by the river

430
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,640
The ice is coming

431
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
The sun's over there

432
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
And just stop on it

433
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
The weed is for live

434
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
And just stop on it

435
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
But I have no fear

436
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,640
Cause I'm done, it's out and I live

437
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
And I don't want a chance

438
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
But I have no fear

439
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Cause I'm done, it's out and I live

440
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
And I don't want a chance

441
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Cause I'm not a journalist, I live by the river

442
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,640
I get this, love me call it this, I was there too

443
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
And you know what they said, the stomach was too low

444
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,640
And I'm recalling at the top of the dial

445
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
And after all this, won't you give me a smile

446
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,640
I've never felt so much that I could like the night

447
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
That is curry

448
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Hello, this is Kizzle, I run a site called HectorMedia.net

449
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,640
What this site does is I'm not just purely saying this to promote

450
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,640
My stuff and you don't want to promote their stuff

451
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,640
I've taken roughly 15, 20 shows, I don't know, I'm not really keeping track

452
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:34,640
They're audio and video that they relate to the hacking, phone freaking and geek scene

453
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,640
So you have all these shows in this one place, so you don't have to keep going to their websites

454
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Now these guys have nothing to do with podcasts and they don't know anything about it

455
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,640
So I know I did this before I knew about podcasts as well

456
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,640
But it still applies to podcasts because what you can do is

457
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,640
You have a few podcasts and shows that kind of fit in your same genre

458
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Let's say you have some people that do a show about fishing, you have three or four shows

459
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Well, I'll come together, one little site have your own little community

460
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Have your own forums and you can all kind of work together

461
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,640
And discuss, oh, you're going to have some so-called on-for-a-gast

462
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Or you can come up with different show topics

463
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,640
And just kind of grow as your own little, have your own little club

464
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Another thing you can do, and this is what I do with hacking media

465
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,640
As soon as I found out about podcasting, I said all my shows

466
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,640
And since when, every time someone posts a new episode on hacker media

467
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
It goes into an RSS feed

468
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
So I just put the encapsulation thing

469
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,640
And so now the whole entire RSS feed is a podcast

470
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,640
So instead of the hacker media feed being just one show

471
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,640
It's several shows, so it's more like a radio station

472
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,640
So if more people do that, I think it'd be the interesting direction for this to go

473
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Instead of having to find all these individual shows, you find one good station

474
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,640
And I want to tune into the cooking

475
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Exactly, exactly

476
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
This is something that Dave and I were talking about just last night

477
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,640
And thanks for the comment

478
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,640
And I think this is probably going to work with OPML files

479
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,640
I've seen, or I'm seeing more and more aggregators working with OPML files

480
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
For a reading list or a subscription list

481
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Where you can actually just drag and drop an OPML file

482
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Or import an OPML file to get all your subscriptions that are in an OPML file

483
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,640
And although I think there's only one or two that actually do drag and drop

484
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Probably net news wire and Jager, Jager does a drag and drop

485
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,640
But I've seen lots of different aggregators support that

486
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
And I think that this is where we're going to go

487
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
You're right with radio stations

488
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,640
I think that we're working on ways to integrate this

489
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Into iPotter.org, but I'm pretty sure that if you have a

490
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Well, if you're maintaining a node, you're maintaining an OPML directory file

491
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Which is an outline when each line in the outline points to a podcast

492
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
That indeed could be seen as a station

493
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,640
A station that maybe it's all maybe all the podcasts

494
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Or about one particular topic, but it could also be just people that are talking back and forth

495
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,640
For instance, if I were going to create a station, I'd put morning coffee notes in there

496
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I'd put the dawn and drew show in there

497
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,640
I'd put maybe one or two IT conversations

498
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Maybe the Gilmour gang and that would be deemed as a station

499
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,640
You can subscribe to an entire station instead of just individual shows

500
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,640
And of course you can make your own station by also creating an OPML file

501
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,640
If you want to know more about OPML, go to the iPotter directory at iPotter.org

502
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Go to the Contribute folder

503
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,640
And in there there's information about OPML, how you can create OPML files

504
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
And what applications will help you do that

505
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Adam

506
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Brian wanted me to give you some big ups to you for playing my clip of the debate

507
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
The other day on daily source code

508
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
You don't mad

509
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Yeah, you don't mind

510
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,640
I was actually the AT&T demo we found out later that Brian put on his podcast

511
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,640
I think was his portalette podcast when he did all the

512
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
All the synthesized voices

513
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Very cool

514
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Unfortunately, you can't quite put a whole audio book yet into their test form

515
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,640
But it does work and you can select different voices and we're really getting to good places with this audio stuff

516
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
With the text the speech synthesis

517
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Hey Adam, how you doing?

518
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
I'm doing good, thank you

519
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Name is Jimmy Jet

520
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,640
I wanted to let you know

521
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,640
I've got a podcast up at jimmyjet.com

522
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
That's jet with two teas

523
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,640
Also, I kind of stole an idea from Chris Perillo

524
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I'm using Skype, though, to record voicemail

525
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
I didn't know if you are aware

526
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,640
But there is a voicemail program that works with Skype

527
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
It's called replay telequarter

528
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
It's from applying technologies at their website

529
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
Applying Technologies.com

530
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
It's in beta

531
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
But it's not bad

532
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
It's got a few bugs

533
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
But it works pretty well

534
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
So people can Skype, Jimmy Jet

535
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
And leave me a voicemail message

536
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
And then here it back on the podcast

537
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
So there you go, have a great day

538
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
And good luck with all the bandwidth problems

539
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Okay, well, thanks Jimmy

540
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Bandwidth problems are more or less solved

541
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Now it's the physical problems that are happening

542
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
We're 31 minutes into this show

543
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I think that's just about it

544
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,640
I do want to say that I wish that Skype

545
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,640
And I believe I found out that the development of Skype is being done

546
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
I think in India

547
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Or maybe another far east country

548
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
I've been trying to get a hold of anyone

549
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,640
who's working on the macOS X version of Skype

550
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Because it's so close to exactly what I need

551
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,640
The only thing that it seems like it should be reasonably trivial

552
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Is we need to be able to select which audio device we want to use

553
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,640
When using Skype on OS on OS 10

554
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Because then I can route the audio around

555
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
And I can make phone calls and record those

556
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
So if anyone knows anything about

557
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,640
The Skype development team

558
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
For Mac, please let me know

559
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Because it's such a small thing that they have to put in

560
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,640
And it's already kind of I think that all these pieces are already available

561
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,640
It works that way with the X10 light phone

562
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,640
It works that way with iChat AV

563
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Just need to get that thing done

564
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
And of course I'd love to have the voicemail feature

565
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
But that seems like it's Windows only

566
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Alright, I'll tell you what

567
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
I'm going to close up the show for today

568
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm sure everything will be much better by tomorrow

569
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Certainly I hope to be over this chill

570
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Or flu or bug or whatever it is

571
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
And I appreciate your tune

572
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
