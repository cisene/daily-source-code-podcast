1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:11,500
It's the source code.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Today is Sunday August 22nd 2004.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I'm at Curry another source code from Belgium from Curry Castle where it looks like, oh,

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,420
with any luck we maybe saw it in this place pretty soon.

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,420
Belgium came back on Friday to look for the second time when it comes back Monday morning

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,420
tomorrow at 11 a.m. so that's pretty encouraging.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,420
For today I just want to talk about a couple things.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,420
Hold on a second, Mike.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,420
My preferred is...

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,420
Am I even...

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,420
Nah, hey.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,420
Let me see if I can switch this on the fly.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
You

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,980
So my internal mic on my laptop to be a great attribute to Apple if I can do this on the

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,980
fly.

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Let's see.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,980
One, two.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,980
Yeah.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,980
It worked.

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,980
Okay.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,280
Well, continuing to record.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,900
That sounds a hell of a lot better.

23
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,360
Lots of people are asking me what the source code, where the name came from source code

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,500
and they obviously didn't catch the very first episode.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,460
source code is pretty much what it would sound to be.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,100
It's what's behind the program.

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,340
If you look at my web log is okay, here's all the thoughts that are distilled from my

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,500
brain that I actually get onto the web, get published.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,940
The thoughts behind that is the source code.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,300
And so every day I just talk about whatever's going on and what I'm thinking about and what's

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,660
happening.

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,340
And most of what I've talked about is probably linked to on that day or the previous day's

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,500
page.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
So this is just the brain dump.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,900
It's usually about 10 to 15 minutes long and I try to do it every single day.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,380
Doug Kay from IT Conversations which you can find at ITconversations.com left a note on

37
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,640
my web log. He wanted to know if my ipotter software, if that script was going to support

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:18,560
AAC files which is Apple's compression and DRM technology for audio compression. And

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,000
yeah, the answer is of course it will. And the best part is that AAC files indeed have

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,440
a bookmark. So if you go to a different track on your ipotter and iTunes or your MPD player

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,320
in general, when you go back to it, it should pick up where you left off. But yeah, you know,

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,200
there's a lot to do. How about support for Adam files and do Adam files actually have

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,400
enclosures? I'm sure that they do. But that's, you know, that's going to be a whole nother

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,240
trick to figure out how to support that. And quite frankly, I'm hoping that someone picks

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,520
up and starts doing about

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500
better iPod or in a cross language platform or scripting language and takes over. But

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,760
until then, I'll continue developing. Doug K. Vit conversations. One of the shows that's

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,620
on there is Gilmore Gang. And I was listening to last Friday's edition. This is hosted by

49
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,940
Steve Gilmore. He writes for, he's a contributing editor for ZDNet and they have a set number

50
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:40,680
of panelists and besides regular doc swirls, Dave Sifri of Technorati was also on the panel

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:50,820
I guess as a member of the Gilmore Gang. And the guest was Tuntec, Silic from Technorati.

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,100
Now, you know, I was listening to the show or I was thinking Technorati, I have Technorati

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,980
links on my web log but I get as far as I can tell I have.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,960
I guess zero benefit out of it.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,760
There's never a paying to it.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,960
There's never an updated Tenorati link,

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,700
or very, very rarely.

58
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,600
So I'm not quite sure what it does.

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,080
I understand what they're talking about,

60
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,560
but so I'm just kind of listening away, surfing a bit.

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,080
And then I heard Steve Gilmore say something interesting.

62
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,360
And he started talking about something he called

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,920
the iPod platform, like whoa, hold on.

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,960
That sounds like something that I've been talking about.

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,680
The iPod platform.

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,000
iPod as a platform, a way to distribute information,

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
not just music or MP3s, but it could be a lot more.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
Like the Gilmore gang, for instance,

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,240
and like this show, Source Code.

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,360
So of course now I feel more than ever,

71
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
like we're on to something here.

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,120
And I wanna just play a little bit of that part

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,400
of Steve Gilmore talking about

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
what he calls the iPod platform.

75
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,040
And it's about three minutes.

76
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
just have a listen person.

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,500
That TANTech mentioned was the different kinds of data types.

78
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Video, audio, this program, for example, is achieving a very, very important audience

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,500
in the download market, in the iPod platform, as I've called it.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:33,500
As new programs come online, Dave Weiner does his morning coffee notes.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Adam Curry has got a terrific daily program called Source Code, I believe.

82
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:46,500
And, Hallie Sude, I believe, has a program that she started on IT conversations.

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Doug can fill us in on that.

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
So, you know, as this kind of content starts to proliferate, it seems that we're going to have

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,500
a similar problem, which is finding the time to consume the best of this information.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
as it populates the network.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, does attention have a role in this space?

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,940
I think this is not a fact.

89
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:22,860
I think it's important to realize that sometimes it's better to try to solve a simple problem

90
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,140
and try to do a really good job at it and get lots of feedback and iterate and then

91
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,260
try to grow certainly the scope of what you're working on if it makes sense, if it can make

92
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,980
sense to include other data types, other media types.

93
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,740
What we are involved in sort of talking about, you know, up to this point has been

94
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,860
sort of onslaught of text that we've been subject to because of the internet and that

95
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,660
we feel an almost urgency to all keep up with.

96
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,460
We kind of feel left out if we don't know exactly what everyone's saying about everything.

97
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,660
And that's the first approach is to try to at least triage that to something manageable.

98
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,140
But you're absolutely right, Steve.

99
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,300
It's not like the flood is over when we've solved that problem.

100
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,580
New media types are showing up more and more just like blogs that made it easy to publish

101
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,780
text on the web.

102
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,940
The audio blogs and other tools are developing.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to publish other media types, audio, photos, etc.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and share them.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And then the question is, well, how do I pay attention to what's most interesting there?

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And so absolutely, I think that we're trying to keep multiple media types

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or media type independence in mind from the beginning.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I mean, to me, this is a very similar characteristic to the T-Vo environment.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I used that as a Kleenex type brand name rather than specific manufacturer.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's T-Vo for the web.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And as the web and multiple media's crisscross and sort of converge,

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we're seeing companies like SBC and the paper yesterday.

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SBC and just network are moving toward movies on demand.

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,700
They're keeping it fairly scoped to the traditional content providers, the movie studios and the

115
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
record companies.

116
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:32,980
But once the door is opened, I think that we'll see a lot of direct to web or direct from

117
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,820
web content starting to emerge.

118
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:43,540
And the characteristics of people who are consuming that media, if they are recorded

119
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:52,580
and transmitted to the attention network using attention.xml, that essentially allows for

120
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:03,180
the implicit metadata of how people consume this information to be them returned to the

121
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,500
group of people that are interested in.

122
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,780
You know, maybe there are 100 people who have already listened to the next open source or

123
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,140
source code broadcast.

124
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,140
and say that it's the best one yet.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,480
the way that they've listened to it in terms of what they've done with other input systems

126
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,720
on the computer during that period of time. In other words, nothing would be an indication

127
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,480
that this is a useful program that they've listened to from beginning to end without

128
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,200
stopping or doing much else except perhaps clicking on the website, Adam's website for

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
more information.

130
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,040
Okay, so a couple extra interesting things there that Steve was saying. I guess they're

131
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,840
talking about some attention, some present server or something in the middle. That's

132
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,760
probably what Technorati is supposed to be is where, oh, there's a whole bunch of stuff

133
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,600
that you should be looking at. Click here to go check it out. But it sounds good.

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,160
I don't know if it's really possible or, you know, but it actually sounds a little bit

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,680
ahead of where we're at right now where we still have to figure out how to get two different

136
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,520
types of feeds, RSS and Adam to work together. You know, we're still working on the aggregator

137
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,900
And then what Steve was talking about, TBO for the web, I totally agree with that.

138
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,220
That's where aggregators are going to get a lot smarter and probably more specific doing

139
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,060
certain tasks and hopefully we'll also have the big mother of all aggregators that'll

140
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,740
do everything for you when you want it as you like it and spit it out in multiple play

141
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
out systems.

142
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
Um

143
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,460
what the end of the day was talking about how people would be listening to a program

144
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,580
for instance like source code and what you're doing while listening to it. I'm interested

145
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,500
if you want to leave a comment please do. Do you listen to the whole thing from beginning

146
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,020
to end? Do you do anything else? Are you reading, surfing, checking email? Are you walking?

147
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,620
Are you in the car? I'd love to know where you listen to the program.

148
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:21,300
And of course something I'd love to enhance this show is the ability to somehow embed

149
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,980
links. I'm not quite sure how that would work. It may not. Right now as D point out you've

150
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,300
listened to the the audio blog post and if you want more information you go do my web

151
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:42,900
blog. And let's see I want to talk about oh Patricia, she of course always wonders what

152
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,260
I'm doing here in the bar with the door closed and I told her about source code and she listened

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
She always thinks quite commercially and said,

154
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
well, so how do you plan to make money on this?

155
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,040
Or I said, no, no, that's not the point.

156
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
And though I'm gonna be able to convince her

157
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,600
how I see that working and why should you have to charge

158
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,560
for something just because I get paid in other media

159
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,320
to use my voice in exactly the same way,

160
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,000
that's kind of inexplicable.

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,680
But one thing you could do, of course, is,

162
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
well, if we have enough of the right people listening,

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
could always embed commercials.

164
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,800
And, gee, we could do all kinds of interesting commercials.

165
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,320
Here's one that I pulled out of my iTunes

166
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,480
that reminds you just how far we've come in advertising.

170
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm very much self-believant.

171
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm just glad I'm on my gun.

172
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Take a head, please.

173
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Hehe.

174
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Winston takes good, like a cigarette.

175
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Um...

176
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,500
One more plea for software to do this type of program with.

177
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Um, I've been given so many recommendations and I even tried megasag recently.

178
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
And no one really just has it.

179
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I posted about this before, I posted the interface and really what would be absolutely perfect is it.

180
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,500
If I could just record whatever comes out of the speakers, including a mic signal.

181
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Um, because then I could just be playing quick time movies or MPEGs or MP3s and whatever player I wanted.

182
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I could have playlists and a program that does playlists.

183
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Well, it seems like it can be done.

184
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
It has, it must be possible.

185
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
You can just get to the core audio driver or something like that.

186
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Um, in order to, um, add to record all of the audio.

187
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
And, um, audio hijack, although it can record multiple...

188
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,940
multiple applications and a mic input at the same time it writes them to all

189
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,580
different files so it's just not you know I really need a DJ mixing setup that

190
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:11,400
will write a mix directly to mp3 and and and enables you to set up a couple of

191
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,480
hotkeys to trigger off preset stuff you should be able to drag stuff into a

192
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,640
playlist on the fly if you want as you're talking and and the mic channel has to

193
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,080
be able to mix it and some processing of the mic channel would be nice as well

194
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:32,360
okay song of the day beautiful day here in Belgium it's nice and sunny and I

195
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,480
figured we got to play something that everybody can sing along to

196
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:52,800
this is one of those songs the Beatles

197
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I could have had a place to live

198
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, I know I saw her

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I was there

200
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
You'll see who got me

201
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500

202
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Every part of love

203
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I've fallen out of her

204
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,500
She wouldn't have had

And then

I'll never dance without my love Oh, my soul stands there.

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It was in the house of the world Standing there.

228
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It was in the house of the world Standing there.

229
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I thought I was standing there at Beatles on source code for today.

230
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I just wanted to wind up today's report with some work I did last night.

231
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,500
on this pinnacle show server which I blogged about and I've spoken about earlier in source code reports.

232
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Now, what this turn... well, what it is, it's kind of a DVD-like device. That's the slimline thing.

233
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,500
You put on top of DVD player and you basically plug a Wi-Fi card in the back which comes which is supplied with.

234
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
And then you hook it up to your TV, you have hooked it up to our big grandmaster view screen.

235
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,500
And then you start a server with some special software that only runs on Windows.

236
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:17,500
And then you can scan your drive, get all kinds of media, you set up a watch folder, drop stuff in, it's added to the library.

237
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:29,500
And what you do is you log into the system on your television with your remote and it gives you an overview of your library and it plays stuff in order for you and it's shuffle stuff.

238
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:38,500
And I thought this was some pretty sophisticated stuff until Yerun posted on the comments on my web blog pointed me to an open source.

239
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
a source version of a server and it turns out that this box is really no more than just a web browser with media players, which is a pretty good idea.

240
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They really should promote that idea so more people would be making content management systems and servers specifically for this.

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They seem to be using all open protocols so that's fine, maybe a couple of extra bits there to get the new media light working on the front if something new is added.

242
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:15,000
In fact, I built a little webpage on my powerbook and connected to it from the system and linked to an mp3 file and it played.

243
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Then I started digging a little bit into the windows, not to the code, really into the directory and it turns out that's a web server running some PHP scripts.

244
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So, interesting. And if anyone has any ideas out there for a media jute box that I might be able to connect to, if you connect to it with a web browser,

245
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,620
essentially you can do it with this thing. You know let me know about it. And

246
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,580
finally I'm looking for more RSS feeds with audio enclosures. You know as I

247
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,860
work on the next beta release of iPodter I need more content coming in just to be

248
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,700
able to test in a real-world environment. You know my own stuff comes back to me.

249
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,180
Dave's on the road right now he's not updating very frequently. There's some

250
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,540
other audio blogs that have no RSS feed or most of them though. Maybe maybe one of

251
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,500
the big services has an enclosure feed that I'm not aware of yet. So please let

252
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:23,740
me know. It's Adam at Curry.com and my web log is at live liv.curry.com.

253
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,700
I'd love to hear from you and thanks for listening if you caught this through

254
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,420
iPodter or through another news aggregator. Thank you very much for

255
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:42,980
subscribing and we'll talk to you tomorrow.

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:21:03,380
