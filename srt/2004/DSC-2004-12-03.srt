00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well everybody, how are you doing? Welcome to the very first podcast coming to you from the Starbox

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I have from Gilford right now I'm getting a whole bunch of people looking at me quite strangely

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What the hell is that guy doing over there in the corner? He's clearly talking to himself

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And what's that thing he's actually talking into? It's a wonderful

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm gonna see you back in the explain on the front event of the day and explain to you exactly why we're coming to you from the Starbox

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Some Gilford where I located on Marcus Street right off the high street, which is completely located in the center of the lovely town of Gilford

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is the Starbox where the having upstairs which kind of looks like a what's it called kind of like a frat house

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's got all these crushed velvet chairs full of all kinds of stains that you really don't want to wear

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And they've got the music cranking here. They've got the tunes going there's a whole bunch of people here who are connected to their

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To the Wi-Fi, which is

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But more than I can say for the cottage at the time being is gone through quite a bit of crap in a couple of days

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And let me try to explain and let me tell you what I'm going to be doing here for as long as it takes essentially

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So yesterday was December second and I was promised that my telephone line at home, which is

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Connected by British telecom that it would be provisioned to a DSL line, which means basically they they unplug it at one end

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And plug it into another socket and then you have a DSL connection which means you can have a telephone line running over it

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Or you can have broadband running over that same line

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now there's a whole bunch of providers you can choose from in the United Kingdom

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And the way that works is the infrastructure is basically put in by British telecom

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's nothing you can do about that that's the same in many countries

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not quite sure in the states who owns most of the copper wire probably 18T owns a whole bunch of it

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But in the Netherlands it's KPN. It's all the you know these used to be government organizations that they would run the phone companies

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So the infrastructure is British telecom

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They offer a broadband service which is limited and needed to 30 gigabytes a month

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now we've been through that at the castle, so I knew it didn't want that

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And I wanted an unmetered service and there was this and I did a lot of research by the way

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And I called up companies I talked to them because I wanted to make an educated choice and do it right

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I got a lot of help from the blogger sphere and people who listen to the source code

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Giving me ideas even though I hadn't really disclosed the location of where we were living

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now everyone knows because I'm so pissed off that all places the mini silicon valley of the United Kingdom

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Which gulfed in some respects really is that you can't get a home based DSL broadband at the time being

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because British telecom says there's no more ports available to let me continue

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I chose UK online because first of all they have an unneeded service

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Talk to the guys and tech support they sounded really nice really helpful

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Very knowledgeable about what they were doing

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And decided to go with them now they're just the ISP basically British telecom still has to plug me in and activate my line

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then I'm essentially just logging in through you know just logging in over the network

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So really it's all back-end stuff

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So it doesn't matter who I would go with

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And no matter what provider the physical connection of the DSL line comes from British telecom

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So they even set up a date which was December 2nd and they told me they told the ISP UK online

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Which is UK online dot net of course links to everything in the show notes for today

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know that they were going to provision my line which basically means the guy goes down to the exchange and you know switches my line over

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So it didn't happen yesterday I called up like five after six last night because it could be provision between

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
830 AM and 6pm and they said well hold on a second

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now it looks like it still hasn't been provisioned when you call back in the morning

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And we'll be able to call British telecom and find out what's going on

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I did that this morning and they called BT and British telecom said well, you know we're really sorry

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But they're just no more ports available so we can't plug you in no matter who you're with until someone leaves or until a port becomes free

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well that's a problem particularly when you told me we're going to do it

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And I can't blame the the ISP they're just kind of sitting in the middle and you know they don't know what to do

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I called up British telecom verified the story and they said you know

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I said well what if I take a broadband from BT doesn't make any difference or we can't help you

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well am I on the list yeah of course you're on the list well where am I on the list or we can't tell you

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well how does it work you know well since we have to be impartial to all providers there's some magical cue somewhere

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So it sounds like a whole cacophony of crap sitting there

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Just unclear to what's going to happen, but the one thing I will tell you that you cannot have a community like this

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Which is literally filled with researchers, scientists, professors, students

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean it's a go go look at Gilford on Google and I'll supply a couple of links to the research park in the business park

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can't have people come here and live if they can't get DSL broadband and if they can't get it reasonably quickly

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So this should be seen as a community wide problem not just a podcast community problem and by the way

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Having the prints of pod without pipe is fucked up ladies and gentlemen

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It really sucks

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So a whole bunch of people helped out you can see the comments on my weblog live.curate.com

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Some folks were even at Lee Wilkins for instance I'm going to try and call Lee on Skype in a second

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lee Wilkins knows some people some monkey mugs with inverters telecom

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And he's going to try and run stuff up the flagpole internally

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Receiving it anything changed other people sent me links to satellite broadband companies

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I looked at a lot of that and even though they do have DVB which is digital video broadcast in the UK which is much lower orbiting satellites

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I guess comparable to DAB

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's basically every single service besides being outrageously expensive anywhere from three to three hundred to seven hundred dollars a month

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Outside of your installation charge of a good two thousand dollars there's bandwidth restrictions

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Which is exactly what I don't want right

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Excuse me that's the coffee mocha

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Coming back like bad Mexican food for lunch

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, so

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Other options were

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Cable now apparently I do live in an area that NTL cable

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Does provide access to

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I registered sent to my details they sent me emails saying they will contact me that was four hours ago

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Of course they haven't contacted me yet

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And regardless the soonest they'll be able to install anything will be on the 20th of December which is I can't live that long

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's just this like it's like not having hot water in your house

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I cannot live without broadband. I told Patricia I said I will have to fucking move

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is only one step lower than on the scale of crap as the dogs and cats having to go into quarantine

85
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So we'll see what happens until then

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And I've gotten past the pissed off stage now. You know I was really really angry really angry this morning as you might well imagine

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now I'm in a just a problem solving mode

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So if it means that I will have to sit here every single day every week day until I get broadband installed

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've to sit at Starbucks and do the podcast from here and look like a total fool

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then I will if that's what it's going to take. In fact starting today every week day

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can find me at the Starbucks and Gilford on Market Street is right off of the high street

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can find me upstairs kind of in the corner close to the

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Electrical outlet. I've got my full kit here. I've got my SM7 sure microphone

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's the one on the on the stand. I've got the table stand. I've got my my M audio breakout box

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So if you bring your own mic we can plug it in we can plug in instruments even

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But every day at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I'll be doing the podcast from here

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I'm cranking up with some music right now to get into the mood

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Good with my American heartbreak

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a Michael Butler's band from Rock and Old Geek Show here's sick and tired

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, who's out of you on?

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You want the clock? Well, the G I was the judge

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Remember every day, look time lost, getting dinner day

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000

You can see what's going on

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000

We're the shine through

We're crossing baby when I say

Nothing for you

117
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't get in the way

You can see what's going on

We're so sick and tired

147
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,000
Everybody's sick and try it

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm so sick and try it

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000

We're so sick and try it

152
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:40,080
I'm American Heartbreak sick and tired coming to you on the daily source code for, well,

153
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
shoot, what is it?

154
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,960
December 3rd, 2004 coming to you from the Starbucks on Market Street right off the

155
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,200
high street in Guilford, in the United Kingdom, just the stones throw away from the cottage.

156
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,680
So now that we all know where I live or more or less, let's see if we can get Lee Wilkins

157
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,560
on Skype here.

158
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Let's see if we can get him on Lee, hello Lee, Lee are you there?

159
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Hello Lee, can you hear me?

160
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Hmm, I heard him for a second there, it looks like we lost them.

161
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Let's see if he's maybe just who now actually looks like he went offline.

162
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,560
So we'll see if Lee can come back in a sec.

163
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Usually at this point, if I were on the radio and this were live, I'd say if you just

164
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
tuned in, then this is what we're doing.

165
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,560
But I guess that makes no sense because you've been tuned from the beginning presumably.

166
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
It would be cool if I could get Dave one.

167
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,560
Oh, I think it comes to Lee, let's see if we can get him in now.

168
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Lee, hello Lee, Lee, can you hear me?

169
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,560
I can hear Lee, maybe he can't hear me for a second reason.

170
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Hold on, let's see.

171
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Yes, I can hear you.

172
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Yes, I guess he can't hear me, hold on.

173
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Maybe I have to change some setting here, hold on.

174
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Yeah, I see the problem here.

175
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
The input should be set to, well, you should be able to hear me on this.

176
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I understand Lee, me not hear you.

177
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Well, I can hear you.

178
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Turn on your speakers.

179
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Just a thought, dude.

180
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,560
I mean, I can see there's, it's going in.

181
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
I can see that there's sound coming out.

182
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Let me try the internal microphone.

183
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Does that make any difference leaking here?

184
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
No.

185
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
I hear this.

186
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
There on.

187
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
I hear the Skype beat.

188
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Shoot.

189
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Come on, Lee.

190
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Shoot, I guess he just hung up.

191
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,560
That makes no sense, because I can hear him.

192
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Okay, we'll see if he'll call back in a second then.

193
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Ah, you mind if I reboot?

194
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
No.

195
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Go for it.

196
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Okay.

197
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Perfect.

198
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Well, then I suggest, what should we do?

199
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Shall we wait for Lee to reboot?

200
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Because I really wanted to get him on for two reasons.

201
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
One, he's been helping me out.

202
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Very nice of him.

203
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
He's been helping out with the, with the bandwidth problems.

204
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
The second one being.

205
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Excuse me.

206
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Oh, man.

207
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
The mocha.

208
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
I got it.

209
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I can't drink coffee and mocha.

210
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Before doing a podcast.

211
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
This should be a new podcast rule.

212
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Can't do that.

213
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Let's see.

214
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Is there anything else I can play?

215
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,560
God, I don't have anything else prepared, really.

216
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Any other stuff?

217
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Let's see.

218
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Dave Weiner, I guess he got up and went to bed.

219
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Dave actually wrote a nice little piece on scripting news that I'll read to you all,

220
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
waiting for Lee Wilkins to come back online.

221
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
He must have something wrong with his, with the setup.

222
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Because I can see that we had audio going out.

223
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
And I could definitely hear him typing.

224
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Let's see what Dave wrote.

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
I guess Dave got up.

226
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
What time to get up?

227
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Yeah.

228
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
317 in the morning Pacific time.

229
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,560
He writes on his weblog scripting news.

230
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
That's scripting news.

231
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Scripting.com.

232
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
I was hoping that my partner in podcast.

233
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Adam Curry will be back on the air today.

234
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
But apparently it's not going to happen anytime soon.

235
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
British telecom says they have no more ports.

236
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
That someone has to leave before he can get one.

237
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
And there's a wait list.

238
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Of course, we're all really disappointed.

239
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Not just Adam.

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
He's part of an international community.

241
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Yeah, fucking A.

242
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
And I'm sure that the community is going to help out in this case.

243
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Because I can just feel it.

244
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
I can just feel it.

245
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Okay.

246
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Let me see if I've gotten any more.

247
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Any more suggestions have come through on the comments on the weblog.

248
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,560
And this is the problem with not having any broad band.

249
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Just all your normal communications.

250
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Forget being able to upload or download podcasts.

251
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Your normal communications are just shot.

252
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,560
It takes 20 minutes to just have mail come in.

253
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
You know, let alone that there's no.

254
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
I can't cash attachments or anything like that.

255
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,560
So I have to remember which attachments to go back and get later on.

256
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I mean, it's really, it's a pain.

257
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Okay.

258
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Let me see if I have any comments.

259
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Yeah, it seems to be a new comment on the latest posting.

260
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
I did about bandwidth and deal further.

261
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Let's see what that comment says.

262
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Oh, this is funny.

263
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
This is from Nightwise.

264
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Good luck out of my see.

265
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
You've taken quite the liking to your new title.

266
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,560
The Prince of Pod is indeed far better than the Sultan of Small Band.

267
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Good luck at Starbucks.

268
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Everyone feels my pain indeed.

269
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,560
By now we have 25 different comment links on the previous posting of people trying to help me out.

270
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Let's see if there's anything new that came in.

271
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Even saw my sister post on that.

272
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Oh, boy.

273
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
There's lots here.

274
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Let's see.

275
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Moving back to Belgium.

276
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
That's a good option.

277
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Do you haunt the cottage?

278
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Let's see.

279
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Okay.

280
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
I can have.

281
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Oh, this is nice.

282
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Someone could.

283
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Someone has a staff and Antwerp called the CEO of British telecom request.

284
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,560
An interview was part of an international documentary film entitled The World's Most Backward Telephone Companies.

285
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Oh, that's good.

286
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Everyone says I should use my name and use my cloud.

287
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,560
I don't know about that.

288
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Let's see.

289
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
What is Drew?

290
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Oh, Don and Drew.

291
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Drew checked in.

292
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Drew actually has a satellite link.

293
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,560
I think at the farmhouse in Wisconsin.

294
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,560
And I don't think he's very happy with that either.

295
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Okay.

296
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Now let's see.

297
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Let's see.

298
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,560
How about a.

299
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
We could do with the serious bitties.

300
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,560
I haven't played one by the serious bitties in a long time.

301
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Oops.

302
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Hold on.

303
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Jason's up here.

304
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Okay.

305
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Thank you.

306
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
As a problem with Skype out these days.

307
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Just like I turn on Skype and then within three seconds.

308
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,560
I've got people all over the place.

309
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Insight messaging me and, you know, calling and requesting requesting chats.

310
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
It's a drawback.

311
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Real drawback.

312
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Treeplayless serious bitties.

313
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Then we're waiting for for lead to come back online.

314
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,560
It's only two minutes and 43 seconds if you want to skip ahead.

315
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
This is called the truck song.

316
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Enjoy.

317
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Oh.

318
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
If I had my truck, I'm going to Minnesota.

319
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,560
And there I get a lot of stuff to put in my truck.

320
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,560
And if I had my truck, I'm bringing it all back to you.

321
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,560
And then maybe I do, you're in the flatbed of my truck.

322
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Oh, if I hadn't my fast speed,

323
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,560
I know we'll jump flatbed.

324
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Cherry red love buggy.

325
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Well, we want to be famous.

326
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,560
New year up to many girls.

327
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Just for be and so lucky.

328
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,560
If I had my truck, we'd get out of the city

329
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,560
and go to where it's pretty by the crisis of my truck.

330
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,560
And if I had my truck, I'd leave by the dinners,

331
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,560
the robbers and the winers by the crisis of my truck.

332
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:44,560
My dream is a wish you live for.

333
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:51,560
That comes from your very soul.

334
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:59,560
And dreams there are no stoplights at all.

335
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:07,560
And everybody's beautiful.

336
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
If I had my truck, we'd never have to worry

337
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,560
because we're never in hurry when we're driving in my truck.

338
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,560
And when we're in my truck, there's no such thing as my way

339
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,560
because the only way is a highway street to heaven in my truck.

340
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Oh, if I had my fast speed,

341
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
I know we'll jump flatbed.

342
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Cherry red love buggy.

343
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,560
Well, we want to be famous.

344
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,560
New year up to many girls.

345
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Just for be and so lucky.

346
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,560
We want to be famous.

347
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,560
New year up to many girls.

348
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Just be my honey and my truck.

349
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,560
LeCivius Bitties and the truck song here on the daily source code for Friday,

350
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
December 3rd, 2004.

351
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,560
We are two days away from what the Dutch would call center class.

352
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
I think I probably explained this before.

353
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Certainly written about it on my weblog.

354
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,560
That the Dutch, although Christmas has certainly become more of an institution

355
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,560
mainly because of commercialization.

356
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
They have their version of Santa Claus.

357
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,560
This show up on his white horse with his black peat helpers,

358
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
which is literally what they're called black peats.

359
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
And they are black.

360
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Talk about discriminatory celebrations.

361
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,560
And they go from door to door from rooftop to rooftop on the 5th of December.

362
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,560
And put presents in children's shoes.

363
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Of course, originally these were wooden shoes that they did that.

364
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,560
So even though Christina doesn't need to have anything in her shoe.

365
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Just because of the family that we still have all living back in Holland,

366
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
we're kind of following along with the celebration.

367
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,560
But here in the UK it's all Christmas meant.

368
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Everything is Christmas, the high street.

369
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Let me explain about the high street.

370
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Every town basically has a high street.

371
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
It's kind of what we call the main drag.

372
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,560
And in Guilford where we live, the high street is closed off to traffic until 5 or 6 every single day.

373
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
And it's great.

374
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
You can walk.

375
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
It's cobblestones.

376
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
It's beautiful, you know, quite little streets.

377
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
But also the most modern and the most fashionable.

378
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,560
I mean, you don't need to go to London if you want to do some shopping.

379
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
You just come to the high street.

380
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,560
And right off to the high street is a market street.

381
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
And that's where the Starbucks is that I'm at.

382
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,560
And I'm using the T-Mobile Wi-Fi link.

383
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Only costs like there's Lee.

384
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Only costs like 30 pounds for the week.

385
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
So let's see if we can get Lee and Lee.

386
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Hello Lee.

387
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
I don't know if they're comfortable.

388
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
So I can hear him.

389
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
That's what's crazy.

390
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Why can't Lee hear me?

391
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I don't understand.

392
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I'll send him an instant message.

393
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,560
I can hear you.

394
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Come on Lee.

395
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Say something to his dude.

396
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Maybe we should try this with someone else and see if see if I can get it to work with

397
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,560
with another person.

398
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
I'll send him an instant message right now.

399
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm going to try something else.

400
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Stand by.

401
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,560
And say hi to every one on the source code.

402
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Come on.

403
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Say hi.

404
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Let me try and call someone else here.

405
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Hold on.

406
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Let me call Ron Bloom.

407
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,560
He's my former partner at the company.

408
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,560
We took public in 96 called Think New Ideas.

409
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,560
And I got him running on Skype recently.

410
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,560
I can see his online.

411
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,560
And usually when Ron's online, he'll pick up.

412
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,560
I think he just turns the computer off if he's not using it.

413
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Shoot.

414
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,560
This is not doing the way I wanted it to do.

415
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,560
Okay.

416
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Let's try Dave Winner then.

417
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Although it looks like Dave's asleep.

418
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
We'll give him a shout anyway.

419
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,560
See if he's up and about.

420
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,560
We need some dialing music.

421
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Do we have any dialing music?

422
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
I don't think we do.

423
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Here we do.

424
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Here's some nice dialing music for your bottle.

425
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Trailer for sailor rent.

426
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Now doesn't look like that's gonna work, does it?

427
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Oh, this blows.

428
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I ain't got no cigarettes.

429
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I bet.

430
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Time wrong.

431
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Boom.

432
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Boom.

433
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Boom.

434
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Is it?

435
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Hey.

436
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
For a bit.

437
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Boom.

438
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Man.

439
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
The means by no means.

440
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Prince of the pod.

441
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Hey.

442
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
We should make that sound.

443
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Shit.

444
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay.

445
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,560
I don't understand why Lee Wilkins can't hear me.

446
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Let's try it one more time.

447
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Hello, Lee. Can you hear me?

448
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Shoot.

449
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Okay.

450
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Oh.

451
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Boy, did my Skype just crash there?

452
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah, did hold on.

453
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Maybe that was the problem.

454
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Maybe it needed to be uncrashed.

455
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Can you hear the room?

456
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Hey, we should redo the song.

457
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Prince of the pod.

458
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Cool.

459
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Hey, let's listen to him while Skype is restarting.

460
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
No other than names.

461
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,560
And every hand I've never been down.

462
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
And every lock that ain't got.

463
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Broadband around the same trailers for sailor rent.

464
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
Rooms to death.

465
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
If this sense.

466
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
No.

467
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
No.

468
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
No.

469
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
No.

470
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
That's.

471
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
I ain't got no sugar rest.

472
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
I'll burn.

473
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Telling you that you can make a new hit.

474
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Prince of the pod.

475
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,560
In the 12th of April, my love.

476
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Man means by no means.

477
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Prince of the pod.

478
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Okay.

479
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Let's try Lee again.

480
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Lee.

481
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Hello Lee.

482
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Lee.

483
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Hello Lee.

484
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
Damn.

485
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Lee.

486
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Hello Lee.

487
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Hello Lee.

488
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Oh, this is sucks.

489
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
It's really fucking sucks.

490
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
This is not what I planned on doing.

491
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Hold on.

492
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Oh, that's probably Lee calling me now.

493
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Lee.

494
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Lee.

495
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Lee.

496
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
That's why I say.

497
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Lee.

498
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Lee.

499
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Lee.

500
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Lee.

501
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Hey.

502
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
I can hear you.

503
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Fine.

504
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Yeah.

505
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
You can't hear me at all.

506
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Okay.

507
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
We'll hold on.

508
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
We'll do it this way because now you can.

509
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Can I call me?

510
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Call me on Skype.

511
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
But don't hang this line up.

512
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
We'll just talk this way.

513
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,560
Because I'll be able to record both ends.

514
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Uh.

515
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah.

516
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I could Skype out.

517
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Hold on a second.

518
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
What?

519
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
To this number?

520
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Hold on a second.

521
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Let me.

522
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Okay.

523
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,560
What give me the number?

524
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Yeah.

525
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Yeah.

526
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Okay.

527
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Okay.

528
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I'll call you right back.

529
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Okay.

530
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Okay.

531
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,560
That was actually a fairly intelligent idea Lee had there.

532
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
I could just try to Skype out.

533
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Which means I'm going to use the telephone.

534
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
The telephone version.

535
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Okay.

536
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
So let's see.

537
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
It should be.

538
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Uh.

539
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Country code.

540
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Four.

541
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm going to just enter the number.

542
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
One.

543
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
One.

544
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Two.

545
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Okay.

546
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Let's see if this works.

547
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,560
I'll be cool if that did work.

548
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I wonder maybe I have to put a plus.

549
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Plus sign.

550
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Okay.

551
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Hold on.

552
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Field.

553
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Gee, this is a lot of fun in it.

554
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Okay.

555
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,560
This should be.

556
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Come on.

557
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
There we go.

558
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Ooh.

559
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Just might work.

560
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Lee.

561
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Oh man.

562
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Skype fucking crashed again.

563
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Fucking bugger.

564
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Wow.

565
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Did that sound English or what?

566
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
But God damn it.

567
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

568
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Let's suck.

569
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Skype shouldn't be crashing.

570
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
One away.

571
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
We're now.

572
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Okay.

573
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
30 minutes into this podcast.

574
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I'm still going to try and keep it at 40 regardless.

575
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Oh man.

576
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Okay.

577
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Starting up Skype again.

578
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Let's see if.

579
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
It must be something wrong.

580
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
That's clearly.

581
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Okay.

582
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,560
So I'll put my plus in there.

583
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Four.

584
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Okay.

585
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
Let's try this again.

586
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,560
If long as Skype doesn't crash, then we're good.

587
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,560
But we need a new version of Skype.

588
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
That's for sure.

589
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Lee.

590
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Can you hear me now?

591
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Don't tell me you can't hear me this way either.

592
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
He can't.

593
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
God.

594
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
This is all.

595
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Ah.

596
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Well, there's clearly something wrong with my Skype set up then.

597
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
That's for sure.

598
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Let's see.

599
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Maybe if we change.

600
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Hello.

601
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Lee.

602
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Hold on.

603
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Don't go away.

604
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Don't hang up.

605
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Don't hang up.

606
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Don't hang up.

607
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Don't hang up.

608
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
He hung up.

609
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Shit.

610
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Okay.

611
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm just going to try in the old way.

612
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I'm going to ask him to call me on the phone.

613
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,560
So clearly there's something wrong here.

614
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Okay.

615
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
We'll just do it that way.

616
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
We'll just have him.

617
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I'll call him on the phone.

618
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,560
And this way we'll be able to record it.

619
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Hello.

620
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Lee.

621
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Can you hear me?

622
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
No.

623
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm sure you can't hear me.

624
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Okay.

625
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Hold on.

626
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Come on Lee.

627
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Where are you, boy?

628
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Okay.

629
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Call me on the cell.

630
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Call me.

631
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Then we have it.

632
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Okay.

633
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
There.

634
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Yeah.

635
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Yeah.

636
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Okay.

637
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Buddy.

638
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
How are you doing first of all?

639
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,560
I'm doing pretty well as you can imagine.

640
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I'll explain it in a little while.

641
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
What happened.

642
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,560
It's not so much me on the blood.

643
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
It's trying to put on a very face.

644
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Let's set this up properly.

645
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Because Lee, I've known you for maybe a month or two now.

646
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I met through, well, through podcasting one way or the other.

647
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
And Lee is kind of like a stalker.

648
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Yeah.

649
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
But a good stalker in a way.

650
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,560
And he's been, been skyping me and we've been talking off and on for a while.

651
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,560
And we hooked up by a telephone just a couple days ago.

652
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,560
And he told me this gut-redging story that I just wanted to let everyone know.

653
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Because I think that the daily source code listeners could easily help with this problem.

654
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Lee, you just want to explain what happened.

655
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Because you were, you would move to the States, right?

656
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,560
You were going to go, you had a job line up there, not too long ago, right?

657
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
That's correct.

658
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:04,560
On the 25th of May this year, the UK company that I was working for sent me to the States to help with the US operations.

659
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Which for a 22 year old and being given it opportunity, you know, you're like, yeah, yeah.

660
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
That's correct.

661
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Yeah, exactly.

662
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
So we're in four weeks.

663
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,560
You know, on the first of May this was arranged and by the 25th of May, we touched down in Atlanta.

664
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:26,560
So as we landed, we were kindly put up by one of the members of this social networking site that I worked for.

665
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,560
So we touched down and you know, she hadn't, there was a few problems there, which meant we would kick down.

666
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Because our dogs ate a tomato plant and I hadn't even started to grow.

667
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
When were your dog ate a tomato plant?

668
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Yeah, she kicked us out because of it.

669
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
What out of your apartment?

670
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,560
No, the yard of somewhere where we were staying.

671
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Right.

672
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:57,560
So we'd, and during that time, you know, as you know, if you yourself from your park, your blocks this morning,

673
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,560
getting broadband, you know, almost within a few days, finding somewhere to live is not easy.

674
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
No.

675
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,560
So you had your two dogs, you took with you to the States.

676
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Correct.

677
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
We bought them from London.

678
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
We, to get them from London to the States.

679
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,560
All we had to do was have the microchip.

680
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,560
How certificates.

681
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Right.

682
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,560
And that was pretty much it because the UK is considered as a rabies free country.

683
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Oh yeah, definitely.

684
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Yep.

685
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,560
So we got them to the States and to cut long story short.

686
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
I was fired.

687
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Or I was a subcontractor.

688
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
I was contracted for them.

689
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Yeah.

690
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
So you moved your entire life, including your two dogs.

691
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
And then your contract was cut.

692
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Yeah.

693
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
We sold everything.

694
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
We were standing somewhere.

695
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
We just lost Christmas.

696
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
We kicked out our whole apartment.

697
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
You know, dogs' ball of stuff.

698
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
It's a huge table.

699
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,560
You know, that aside because we've done a full cow.

700
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Yeah.

701
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
And because it is new opportunity that we thought would be great.

702
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
You know, for young 22 year olds to do.

703
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Yeah.

704
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
And to travel and move to the States.

705
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah.

706
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Of course.

707
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
It's a beautiful thing to do.

708
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,560
And I thought I wanted to do it since I was 16.

709
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
I wanted to study there at first.

710
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,560
So, you know, I grabbed the opportunity as quickly as I could.

711
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,560
So we got to the States and we were in that land.

712
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
And then we got fired.

713
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
And we moved to Houston.

714
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,560
I hope I find in Jenny, my girlfriend's and work.

715
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Right.

716
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
She's also 22.

717
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
She's 20.

718
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Okay.

719
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Right.

720
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
She was a bit guided.

721
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Actually, she couldn't drink legally in the States.

722
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Even though she could do so hard to hear any UK.

723
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Right.

724
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I think in that sense, she's glad to be on.

725
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Yeah.

726
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
At least there's some benefit because what happened is.

727
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Now, you guys were, you see, you,

728
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
essentially, you decided to come back.

729
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Right.

730
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Since things didn't work out in the States.

731
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Yes.

732
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,560
But then because you'd been there so short and you hadn't really had time to focus on it,

733
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,560
you didn't have time to get your,

734
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
the dogs, the rabies shots.

735
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
They needed to come back into the country, right?

736
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Correct.

737
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,560
And I, and I just don't think all about you.

738
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,560
I'm an expert now when it comes to the, when it comes to rabies and getting your dogs and cats in,

739
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
because we barely squeaked under the wire.

740
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
So, so basically they have to go into quarantine.

741
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
That's correct.

742
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
That has to go into quarantine for six months.

743
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,560
If we can get them, if and when we can get them to the UK.

744
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,560
But what do you mean, if and when you can, where are they now?

745
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
They're coming at Atlanta.

746
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,560
And this is what's making it more exciting.

747
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Because of the, you know, they're happening through, because of Delta.

748
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,560
We'd spoken to Delta two weeks prior to our flight.

749
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,560
And they booked our dogs on the flight.

750
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,560
And we just assume that they've booked them as a fantastic cargo because, you know,

751
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
they should know what they're doing.

752
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,560
And I'll ring them up two days before the flight.

753
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,560
And a day before I'm due to drive 900 miles from Houston to Atlanta.

754
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Just ask us, because I want it to know that requirement size is for the kennel cases to travel in.

755
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,560
As you said, the woman said, no, sorry, pets don't, pets can't fly.

756
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,560
This is almost like, like, my broadband is like, yeah, sure, no problem.

757
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
And then on the day off, it's like, oh, I'm sorry.

758
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
That's a problem, right?

759
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Yeah.

760
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Yes.

761
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
And plus on top of this, you know, money was tired.

762
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
And I had to try it.

763
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,560
So I didn't have access to a phone or anything.

764
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,560
And I've got a day to sort out the dogs.

765
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,560
So you basically didn't have time to sort it out at all.

766
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,560
No, we, we, I managed to find a, uh, a ball game kennel that we were thinking perhaps just

767
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
leave them there for a few days.

768
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,560
But as soon as we got there, I'm telling you these kennels were the worst kennels that I've ever seen.

769
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,560
You know, I wouldn't want my worst enemies to live in these kennels.

770
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
And this is the delta kennels.

771
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
This was a company that dealt are used.

772
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Oh, shit.

773
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
So what, what kind of dogs are these Lee?

774
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Uh, we have two little jack russles.

775
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Ah.

776
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
And we've just missed their birthday.

777
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Uh, Alfie's birthday was last week.

778
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Well, what's the other dog Alfie and who?

779
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Benson.

780
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
And Alfie and Benson.

781
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Okay.

782
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
So, so let me just recap here.

783
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,560
So if I understand properly because of the incorrect information Delta gave you.

784
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,560
Um, and that you had to drive, you know, a thousand miles didn't have a phone, et cetera, et cetera.

785
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,560
You couldn't get your dogs on the same flight as you, as you and your girlfriend Jenny had coming back

786
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
to the UK.

787
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,560
So they're now stuck in Atlanta or in Houston.

788
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
They're stuck in Atlanta.

789
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Okay.

790
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
How do we get them out?

791
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
What needs to happen?

792
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Um, well, because we don't need set aside $220 that we thought Delta told it was originally

793
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
going to cost.

794
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Um, the fee had not.

795
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
It comes down to don't do it.

796
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,560
And the only people that can fly pets legally,

797
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,560
route of Atlanta into London get week is continental.

798
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Right.

799
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,560
And, you know, I, at the airport, I've done the pig in as much as I could.

800
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Um, with me stuff flights and it all went a bit crazy.

801
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
But that's neither here nor there.

802
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,560
But to fly them out with continental, it's going to cost around $1,500.

803
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Oh, geez.

804
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,560
And that fees grow in by 20 dollars a day because of the kennel costs as well.

805
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Right.

806
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
And this is the horrible can all that they're in.

807
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Yeah.

808
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,560
And the girlfriend, you know, to be honest, I know she's going to listen to this.

809
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
And she's probably going to buy my head off.

810
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,560
She's almost, she's so close to losing the plot.

811
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
She's talking to the dogs that aren't even there.

812
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
Oh, you're kidding me.

813
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
She's not sleeping.

814
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
She's beside herself.

815
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Of course I understand.

816
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,560
This is exactly what would have happened with Patricia.

817
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,560
I totally understand.

818
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
Oh, this is horrible.

819
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
Okay.

820
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,560
So, um, when I heard this story, I said to Lee, I said,

821
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
we got to do something about this.

822
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
And I know how many people subscribe to the daily source code.

823
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,560
And did you, were you able to set up a tip jar like a PayPal tip jar or something?

824
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Lee?

825
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Yes.

826
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
If anyone's willing to help out.

827
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
You know, we will be great.

828
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,560
For if you haven't got Alfie and Benson.com.

829
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
That's Alfie.

830
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Spel it.

831
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
A-L-F-I-E.

832
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,560
And Benson-B-E-N-S-O-N.com.

833
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Okay.

834
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,560
So, there's a PayPal link there that they can donate some money to getting Alfie and Benson back.

835
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
There is correct.

836
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Okay.

837
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Well, that's excellent.

838
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Um, you know, if every source code listener were to just donate one dollar.

839
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Yeah.

840
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,560
But you wouldn't have to work for the rest of your life.

841
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Yeah.

842
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
But I'm hoping that we can get enough.

843
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,560
And, you know, and let us know when you have the 1500.

844
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Okay.

845
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
So that we can, uh, we can celebrate that.

846
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,560
I'm pretty sure that we can get at least 1500 daily source code listeners to donate, uh,

847
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
one dollar at least.

848
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,560
I'm going to, I want to put in my donation right after we hang up and, uh, and, you know,

849
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
let's, let's get Alfie and Benson home.

850
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
At least they'll be home in the UK.

851
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
And then they still have to sit and quarantine for six months.

852
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
That's credible.

853
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,560
We just found out we've actually got 12 days to fly one of them back into the country

854
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,060
because he's choose some medical, um, I don't know there will be girlfriend.

855
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,560
If she feels with that sort of that she's, he's chosen tablets and stuff and injections.

856
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Or it doesn't give you, it doesn't have them in 12 days.

857
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Oh, this is a horrible story, Lee.

858
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Yeah.

859
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
I feel so bad for you.

860
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,560
We have so bad that if you check out Leiratus.com we even put on laptop out there for sale

861
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
that the only laptop that we have.

862
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
that we have.

863
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
We don't want you selling her laptop.

864
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,120
Now I don't want you selling your laptop.

865
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,320
I'm sure that the podcast community can hop in here and help out.

866
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Should be totally doable to get 1,500 bucks totally.

867
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
What else do you think?

868
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,880
I just like to thank you for giving me the chance to tell my story.

869
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
No, Lee.

870
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,160
It's listen from one pet owner to another who's been through the scare and I got off

871
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
lucky.

872
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,560
Especially to have your dog sitting in America in a kennel that you know is all that great.

873
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
It must feel horrible.

874
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
It must feel just terrible.

875
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
It is.

876
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
It is.

877
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
It's very good.

878
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
Okay.

879
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,560
All right, then, Lee.

880
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
We're about 42 minutes into the source code.

881
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
So I'm going to wrap the show up.

882
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,560
I'll go and donate to the first dollars in just a few minutes.

883
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,560
We'll get the podcast out there and let's hope that we can get Alfie and Vincent home pretty soon.

884
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Thanks.

885
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
Thank you very much, everybody.

886
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
Everybody.

887
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
All right, Lee.

888
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
I'll talk to you later.

889
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
Okay.

890
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Thank you very much.

891
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
Okay, buddy.

892
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
All right.

893
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,560
So that's Lee Wilkins on the daily source code with a real sob story.

894
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Been waiting to get the story out to you for like three days because well, it wasn't able

895
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,560
to do it because of the lack of bandwidth to be able to do a Skype call.

896
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,560
So please go over to Alfie and Benson.com and help out Lee and his girlfriend Jenny.

897
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
It's just a sad story.

898
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Those poor puppies.

899
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Those Jack Russells are just sitting there and some horrible kennel in Atlanta.

900
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
So let's help them out.

901
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
And then get me some fucking broadband.

902
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Will you please?

903
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Because that's what I really need.

904
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
I'll leave it at that for today's source code.

905
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
I'll be back Monday here from the Starbucks.

906
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,560
It's your daily source code coming to you from the Starbucks on Market Street.

907
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
We'll be here every single weekday at 2 o'clock.

908
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Come on in and join the party if you want to.

909
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,560
It's right off the high street in Guilford in the UK.

910
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,560

00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,560
Please don't add the comments.

00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Bye bye.
