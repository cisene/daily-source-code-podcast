00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
this is the source code for Thursday August 26 2004. Hi everybody. Good morning, good

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,680
evening, good afternoon, wherever you might be listening to this or whichever day you

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,520
might be listening to this. I'm Adam Curry coming to you from Curry Castle in Belgium

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,080
for as long as we are still here. The move towards the UK is looking good. Hopefully

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,840
we'll have some news about that next week. So it's Thursday is always the hardest day.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,200
If you get up really early like I've been doing for the past year, Thursday is just

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,200
it's the Thursday dip. It's really, really difficult. So just a quick scan around the

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,800
net a couple of things I want to talk about today. After hearing Dan Bricklin on IT conversations,

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,960
I'm relaying that the Halley Suit hosts. Dan posted something on his web blog that you

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,480
might want to check out at DanBricklin.com.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,600
concept of the iPod platform.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,180
And he writes about IT conversations and basically all the stuff that we've been talking about,

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,760
you know, how there are actual programs and shows and how the timing of when you get it

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,020
may not be that important as long as it's automated and put onto your play out device.

15
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,780
And of course he does note that the technology to do this has been around for quite a while.

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,020
But I think now we're finally catching on and I'm very happy about that.

17
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,780
Yesterday I started with the first of my reviews of audiobooks.

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,780
So yesterday, what was it?

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,620
Oh, anti-Americanism.

20
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,380
And today a book that I read, again, big quotes there on the red part because I listened to

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,300
read all my books through almost all my books through audiobooks.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,660
I thought it might be interesting to let you hear what it sounds like when audiobook

23
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,140
has been read by the author.

24
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,780
In this case, Bill Clinton, his autobiography, My Little

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,480
life, which I was thinking about this, I was preparing a clip to play for you today, that

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't think that I would have been able to get through the entire book if I was actually

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,960
reading it. Because I found it, you know, a little bit boring. The way the press in Europe

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,520
certainly played it up is, you know, well, there's not much in the book, but there is

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
this one bit about Monica Lewinsky. And it's dumb, you know, it's interesting to hear

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,920
about what went on behind the scenes, how policy was put together. I particularly like

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:40,560
the all the stories about his presidential election. And just a lot of the decisions

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,840
that he had to make during his presidency and also before and after. But again, it may be

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,560
because you're listening to the president of the United States read these words or speak

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,920
these words that it is entertaining enough to listen to the entire thing. But it's certainly

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,880
not one that, you know, excuse me, I'm yeah, I know I have to take a bath, but I'm taking

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
the iPod with me.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,680
It's not a book like that.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,420
part for you today and I'm going to try and keep a little bit shorter than the previous

39
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,860
excerpts I've done, where Bill Clinton talks about the fact that he knew that he was lying

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:23,340
and that he was betraying his colleagues, his family and of course the American public.

41
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,420
And it is nice to hear someone say, you know, I fucked up and I did a bad thing.

42
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,520
So I'll play that for you right now from Bill Clinton's My Life.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
broke, I called my attorney David Kendall and assured him that I had not sub-orn perjury

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,120
or obstructed justice. It was clear to both of us that Starr was trying to create a firestorm

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,440
to force me from office. He was off to a flying start, but I thought if I could survive the

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,880
public pounding for two weeks, the smoke would begin to clear the press and the public would

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,080
focus on Starr's tactics, and a more balanced view would emerge. I knew I had made a terrible

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,000
mistake, and I was determined not to compound it by allowing Starr to drive me from office.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,800
For now, the hysteria was overwhelming. I went on doing my job, and I stonewalled, denying

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,160
what had happened to everyone. Hillary, Chelsea, my staff and cabinet, my friends in Congress,

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,360
members of the press and the American people. What I regret most other than my conduct is

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,440
having misled all of them. Since 1991, I had been called a liar about everything under

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,920
the sun, when in fact, I had been honest in my public life and financial affairs, as all

54
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,980
would show. Now I was misleading everyone about my personal failing. I was so embarrassed

55
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,180
and I wanted to keep it for my wife and daughter and I didn't want to help Ken Star to criminalize

56
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,820
my personal life. It was like living in a nightmare. I was back to my parallel lives

57
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,820
with the vengeance.

58
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:04,220
Okay, Bill Clinton from my life and I purchased it on audible.com. Not getting paid to say

59
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,980
this but that is a good place to get the most recent audible audiobooks. And it's recently

60
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,980
simple. Although you do have to log in every single time you come back which is pain in

61
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:23,900
the ass and sometimes you know your session expires. Oh well. I want to move on to talk

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,540
about Dave Sluscher's most recent work on the iPod platform and his audio post. But first

63
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,620
I've gotten several messages about iTunes for Windows because people have been working

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,980
on Windows scripts. Dave Sluscher also has created a new version of the Internet.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,600
created a Windows version of his Perl script of the getenclosures.pl which has the same

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,040
functionality as iPod or only actually it's better and I'm using it myself.

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,840
But apparently iTunes for Windows which you can of course use to sync up your iPod.

68
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,480
I haven't done it myself but I presume it's more or less the same where you dock your

69
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,960
iPod and it syncs up with your iTunes library.

70
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,080
Apparently there's a calm object for iTunes which means you can control it and this was

71
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,440
pointed out to me by several people and therefore I guess it's scriptable or addressable or you

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,640
can talk to it.

73
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,040
So if you're interested in working with us and helping out that certainly would be a

74
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,440
big help if we can figure out exactly what we can make iTunes do and if it will only

75
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,800
sync with an iPod or if we can use some of its API to connect to other devices because

76
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,920
iPods, yeah there's millions of them out there but they're certainly not the only ones

77
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,400
nor should they be.

78
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,440
Is there some kind of industry standard for that?

79
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,560
I mean has anyone even looked into it?

80
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I know I'll look into myself then as well.

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,500
So Dave Slusher from evilgeniuschronicles.org,

82
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,820
who's also a radio guy, I know and discovered

83
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,640
from his most recent audio post.

84
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,940
He did an entire 21 minute piece on RSS and enclosures

85
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,540
and monetizing on it and how sponsorship would work.

86
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,580
And I agree with him on a lot of points

87
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
and he's saying some really...

88
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,180
I don't know if you guys heard that,

89
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,700
but my eye chat just started talking to me.

90
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,860
He's saying a lot of intelligent things

91
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,900
about the asynchronous nature of the iPod platform.

92
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,220
And I think the monetizing bit

93
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,500
where he's talking about sponsorship,

94
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,700
he's talking about being paid per download.

95
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,180
I don't wanna go quite that far.

96
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,020
I think it's, yeah, sponsorship will come into play.

97
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,180
Maybe someone will say, hey, would you let us sponsor

98
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,980
your review of audiobooks.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,700
And one of the reasons I'm doing it, not only do I like audiobooks, but I'm sure that there's a market there for people to get reviews about audiobooks and here if it's worth worth purchasing.

100
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:11,800
What we will need a better way of measuring our success and I, you know, yes, there is a pretty broad base and belief in measurement of page views, you need visits with, you know, based on server logs, but they're still.

101
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:26,800
There's a lot of caching going on and, you know, and quite frankly messages are passed on through other means than hitting the same web server, you know, they're relayed from someone's aggregator to someone's web log.

102
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
They're sent via email.

103
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,300
There's so many different ways that it can get, you know, that your network or your content network spreads out.

104
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:42,300
So we need a better way of measuring that and I think that will always come back to a, you know, your advertising, did you get some sales?

105
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,560
sales.

106
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,340
very basic. That is absolutely the most basic way of broadcast advertising. I think it's

107
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:59,340
called per inquiry. You used to see it a lot at night and probably do on most local stations.

108
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,420
There's a phone number, you call it, you order something and then the broadcaster gets a

109
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,660
piece of each sale and of course the person who put together the informational or whatever

110
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,700
it is. That's called per inquiry. I think that that may be a way to go.

111
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,820
Another thing that Dave Sluscher talked about is how this asynchronous nature is giving us

112
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,980
the power to really listen to what he calls I think packets of passion. I'll check an

113
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,660
excerpt in a second. We do have control over what we like and so that we can watch it when

114
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:42,900
we want to and we don't have to invest 12 a day for 12 consecutive weeks to make sure

115
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,020
we don't miss any episode of the story.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,680
of pranos, which gets me to thinking we need some kind of democratic Tivo engine, you know,

117
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,120
so something that can be as smart as Tivo can be based upon all of our behavior anonymously

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,760
and that no one controls and can capture and monetize on that.

119
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,960
Because I don't think that's where the money is going to be, by the way.

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,520
That's the old way of figuring it out.

121
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,800
I think that they're going to be shows.

122
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,600
If people are going to sponsor them and want to be a part of interesting communication.

123
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,120
Anyway, let's have a listen to Dave Slusher because he did figure me out.

124
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,440
He really understands why I created the iPod or Apple script and I'll just share with

125
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,560
you because he has a pretty good analogy for it.

126
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,040
So as we as has been going on between Adam Curry's web log and some of the other people,

127
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,360
he wrote his iPod or script which sort of challenged a couple other people to it was

128
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,040
kind of Tom Sawyer, whitewashing the fence sort of ploy, challenged several of us,

129
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,500
being us to go out and do, you know,

130
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
more fuller featured versions of the same thing, you know, having done a little bit of it.

131
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,500
And making it think it's all our idea. So there is certainly a Mark Twain sort of feel to it.

132
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Okay, you got me. Yes, exactly my plan. And I'm very happy it's working. I'm great that we're working together,

133
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
even though we haven't even, I think, really exchange an email. And there's other people out there,

134
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,500
and they're posting stuff, their comments, and they've got all kinds of ideas. And that's very cool.

135
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,500
And just one more bit of what I call it. Some of Dave's personality. And I'm trying to figure him out,

136
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,500
just from listening to his audio blog posts. You can get a real good idea of what someone's about

137
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
and where they're coming from. And I think he has a real problem with the record industry,

138
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,500
and maybe just with the man in general. So that was the wrong one. Here we go.

139
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
And really, um, fucked it up. That's such a great intro for you, Dave. Here we go.

140
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
And really and truly the more I think that's the best.

141
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,260
think about it, this iPod platform and kind of asynchronously downloading for offline

142
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,700
consumption these bundles of passion is so much better than streaming anyway.

143
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,180
And so I'm again, I'm hoping for the world of delicious irony whereby fucking around

144
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,140
and making it so that internet broadcasting was not economically viable.

145
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,540
They brought about a world with something with much worse potential, much more potential

146
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,800
for changing the world.

147
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,980
And hopefully for reducing the record labels role in it, for disintermediating themselves

148
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,220
out of existence because they're such cock suckers and such greedy fucks that they cannot

149
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:39,260
possibly allow any other business model come in that may anytime now or in the future ever

150
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,980
compete with them.

151
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,860
So these fucking plutocrats may have really really host themselves and so politically

152
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,700
I kind of hoping that that's the case.

153
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,300
But anyway, I'm getting out.

154
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The synchronous is the key.

155
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
OK.

156
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,380
My audio cut out once or twice during that.

157
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,060
I don't know if that actually went out that way

158
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,180
on the recording, but clearly very passionate about what's

159
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,900
going on in the music industry.

160
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,260
And I think that the music industry actually

161
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,260
has a way to help us, which I want to get to in a second.

162
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,900
Just some quick emails and comments

163
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,060
on the web log that I wanted to share with you.

164
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,500
Because I'd asked several of you, where do you listen

165
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,660
to the source code?

166
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,740
What are you working on?

167
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,020
Actually, Peter Oferbakke.

168
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,980
He has a web log at iPortunities.nl slash WordPress.

169
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,820
It's iPortunities with double P. And he's

170
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,260
talking about working on a JavaScript version of iPotter

171
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,100
that will work on Windows.

172
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,580
Let's see.

173
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,420
Then we have Eric Rice, who says that he not only

174
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,020
listens to the show when he's driving but he also replied via his audio.

175
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,840
blog. I look for it but for some reason I couldn't find it so I have to check that again Eric.

176
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:04,840
And Ed also says that there's a way you can use the B script and of course the window scheduler

177
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:12,440
to accomplish the iPod or stuff. And he points to WarnerFogel's .net tool which he had up in

178
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,680
back in October. I think that we still need to connect to iTunes. That's the magic piece. It's

179
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,160
not just downloading the files and extracting the enclosures. It's actually the final last bits

180
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,680
there is getting it on to the iPod without any user intervention. Then we've really created

181
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,120
something. And Tim Watt who has a radio web blog but just Google is named Tim Watt WATT.

182
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,680
He is blogging the Olympics. I didn't think that they were allowed to do that and he seems

183
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,560
like he's a journalist himself. He certainly has all kinds of great credentials and fabulous

184
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,360
pictures and stories on his on his web blog. And I was in the understanding

185
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,340
that no one was allowed to blog anything at the Olympics.

186
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,580
Maybe he's just hanging out, but he's from England and judging from his blog, he's definitely

187
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,100
a journalist.

188
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,840
He said that he's been listening to the show while he's been there for the last week or

189
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,100
so on the new transport system in Athens.

190
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Going back and forth from the media center each night.

191
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
So there you go.

192
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,140
That says a lot about his occupation.

193
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,740
He says, I'm going to quote him here.

194
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,820
I think the Lavino Rolos is something that you've played.

195
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,100
You'll have a special nostalgia for me in the future with the backing of cicadas and hot

196
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,380
weather when he's back in rainy old England.

197
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,620
So wow, you know, I reached out and touched someone with the audio blog and welcome and

198
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,300
thanks for listening, Tim.

199
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,020
So let me wind up with me the song of the day.

200
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,660
I was thinking that it would be nice if we can get the music business involved somehow.

201
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,500
And there's one guy and actually I believe Dave Weiner suggested it to me a while ago.

202
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,360
who would at least understand what we're trying to do and see that there's something there

203
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,560
that needs to be built and can be done and that you don't necessarily have to monitor

204
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,560
it on a better way. And I'll tell you a little story about him after this song.

205
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:28,480
You sign of the times, it's Prince.

206
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:40,640
In fact, the skinny man tied up a big disease with a little name.

207
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,520
If I'd chances, gefric came across a needle and soon changed it the same.

208
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,640
At home, now 70 year old boys and their ideal phone.

209
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,320

Time, time, time, time. Time, time. Best with your mind, for the folks who live, this fall in love, you can have a break, call it late.

237
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:43,020
It's a bull. Time, time.

238
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,300
That's Prince, sign of the times and I want to tell you why I think that he would be great to work on this.

239
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,780
First of all, we already know he believes in a download platform and a market for downloads because

240
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,780
he's one of the first musicians to really dive into that head first. Check out NewPowerGeneration.com.

241
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,020
Secondly, he's very intelligent and very wired and knows exactly what he's doing.

242
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,100
what's going on and it's very aware.

243
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,760
And I can attest to that because I met him

244
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,740
and was invited to Paisley Park Studios.

245
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,140
I was in Minneapolis doing a commercial for,

246
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,980
yeah, of course, Sam Goody's music land.

247
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,700
And it was like a three or four day shoot

248
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,540
and on the second or third day

249
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,860
in the quarter to 12, he almost midnight.

250
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,860
There was, you know, got a phone call

251
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,260
and someone said, hey, you know,

252
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,900
Prince has a little party going on at the studios.

253
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,740
Do you want to come?

254
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,180
And that's where Paisley Park Studios are

255
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,700
and that's where Prince's from Twin Cities.

256
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
And so, you know, are you interested?

257
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,260
And I said, well, let me think.

258
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,660
Yeah.

259
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,500
And I said, well, great,

260
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,260
because the car is waiting outside.

261
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,660
All right, this is cool.

262
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,620
So, hopping the car, go over and it's about,

263
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,620
I guess it was a 35 minute drive.

264
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,980
And then all of a sudden there's Paisley Park,

265
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,700
all lit up in purple, you know, kind of sitting up on a hillside.

266
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,800
through beautiful white metal detector.

267
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,780
There's very indirect lighting

268
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,600
and ushered into a room which was probably,

269
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,460
I don't know, maybe half a football field.

270
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,040
And there was nothing but beautiful people there.

271
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,100
And there was all kinds of Prince tunes

272
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,860
that I'd never heard before.

273
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,260
All kinds of incredible stuff with DJ playing them live

274
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,580
from CDs and mini discs and, you know,

275
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,420
clearly all kinds of unreleased studio material.

276
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,100
It was great, all kinds of healthy food set to one side.

277
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
Everybody and, you know, nice,

278
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,700
everything was white and everyone dressed nicely.

279
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,540
And Prince was over there standing by a sound stack

280
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,460
or actually the speakers behind the speakers.

281
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,220
Just kind of checking everyone out and I said,

282
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
you know, I gotta go over and talk to him.

283
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,620
No, no, no, you can't do that.

284
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,660
What do you mean I can't do that?

285
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,340
Well, you know, like you're really tall and you're white.

286
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,940
I'm like, fuck you.

287
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,740
They invited me, I'm well, thank you for inviting me.

288
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,560
to win over and first of all he's not as small as you think he is and that's that's like an urban legend he is and he wasn't a

289
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,760
checked you know it wasn't like he was wearing extremely high heels but just from what I'd heard about him I expect him to be

290
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,840
really small and I'm six three almost six yeah six four and just isn't isn't like that

291
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:35,080
and he knew he'd been watching MTV he knew what the latest shows were that I'd done and we talked about music and

292
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:44,320
talked about Europe and you know I thanked him for you know for inviting me to this place and yeah you know he's he was just

293
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:54,100
really much more normal guy than you would think or maybe he comes across in his performance and even I and maybe I'm more

294
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:01,740
blasay than next but I was pleasantly surprised and you know then I went back had a drink turned around I didn't see him

295
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,220
and half an hour later or maybe it was an hour and a half later you know party was over and that

296
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,620
is indicated by the security guards coming in and just kind of discreetly flashing their

297
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,540
flashlights on the ground, just kind of flashing around everyone knows, oh it's time to go,

298
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,980
and the music goes down a little bit and level, and we all walk out through the metal detector again,

299
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,860
and I was driven home.

300
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
my Prince story for you. And who knows, maybe someone will hear this and will say, you know,

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,500
yo, Prince, his royal badness, something going on on the internet. You might want to check

302
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,500
out Stranger Things have happened. Okay, I'm going to get this up to the server. Tomorrow

303
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,400
will be Friday, which is my daughter's 14th birthday. So I will be doing a show. I'm not

304
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,760
quite sure what time, but we're pretty, we're excited. We're not half as excited as she

305
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,760
is about to no longer being 13. So I'll talk to you tomorrow on another edition of the

306
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,240
source code and see you then.

307
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Bye.
