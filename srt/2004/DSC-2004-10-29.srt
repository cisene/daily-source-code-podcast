1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,480
Well, good morning everybody. I mean, everybody. It's just a little bit past nine o'clock and I am on my way from Castle,

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,480
back Māori on the highway to Breda. That's where I'm going to pick up one of my instructors in the

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,760
evening and Nick has invited me today. It is a beautiful day. I must say, the sun is shining. There's

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,360
hardly a cloud in the sky. Beautiful sunrise. Oh, full, full. Just burning hot. Beautiful. Although it's

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,920
not really going to be hot, it's going to be about 16 degrees centigrade today, so not particularly warm.

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:59,920
But you might have made to comply with him. I mean, fly with him for Rotterdam Airport, which is a small

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:10,960
but commercially used airport in Rotterdam, obviously. And Rotterdam Airport has flights from

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,840
your KLM and the city hopper, so you can get there. From modern time, you can get to Spain, to France,

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,200
to Portugal, to the UK, so it's really a nice little airport. Just one, one terminal with extremely

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,200
modern and there's a flying club that's also part of the airport, because of course that was probably

11
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,400
there before for some of these commercial guys came in. It was very small airfield. And I'm not

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,280
quite sure who's playing, we're going to be using today. But I have the idea that, you know,

13
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,560
that there's a maintenance that was done on the plane and it needs a good test run, right? And

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,440
that's when I usually get invited, which is cool. So it's a mooney. I'm not sure which mooney it is that

15
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,400
we're flying today. Nickel be able to tell us all about it. I haven't discussed the fact that

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,080
I'd like to do a podcast with him. And actually, I have my wireless mics that and everything

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,240
with me, so I can hook up the inner cons system. So we're going to have some good quality right

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,200
now. I'm just yapping into the yep, right into the microphone. This is that eight kilohertz wave

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
file that you're hearing. So I'm not going to show this is going to be a daily source code, or we're

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,680
just going to do this as an additional fund segment. I'm sure that I'm going to have to edit all

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
kinds of stuff together, because there's a certain point, you know, we may just not be talking

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
at all, it may not be interesting to listen to. So I'm just going to record a whole bunch of stuff

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,880
today, see what pops up, see if it turns out cool. I think that you'll probably enjoy hearing

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,240
me getting instructions on how to find this plane. And the mooney is, I don't have to say it's

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:52,720
kind of a Ferrari single engine piston airplane. It has a light calming engine, which is used in many

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,000
types of single engine airplanes. But this particular model, because I've flown, I think it's

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,200
the same one. I've flown this one before, has, well, mooney has retractable landing gear, it has a

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,440
low wing, not a high wing. So you're kind of sitting on the wing, as it were, which I think is

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,440
a little less like sporty for you. It's kind of, it's more like a professional airplane with an

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,400
underwear. And it has auto pilot and all kinds of cool stuff in there. You can fly this plane

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,480
completely IFR, instrument flight rules, which means that you can fly to the dark or bad weather,

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,040
and you can land it on the ILS of any ILS equipped airport. So it's a beautiful machine, and I'm

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,640
not quite sure where we're going to go today. We might go up to the very top of the Netherlands,

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,280
which is almost the very bottom of Scandinavia. It's also possible that we might just fly across

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,040
the North Sea or across the channel to BlackBush, which will be my new airport. So we're just

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,760
going to kind of see what happens where it takes us. Almost at Nick's house, and the next time I check

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,200
in, we'll probably be on startup checklist. So stay tuned everybody.

38
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Come to Peru. In Lama Land, there's a one-man band, and it'll tutt his flute for you.

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:55,440
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue. Once I get you up there, where the air is where

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:09,680
you are. We'll just fly, start. Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you a sword.

41
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:22,720
You made angels cheer cause we're together. Where the wise it's such a lovely day.

42
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:35,600
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to a book obey. It's perfect for flying

43
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:44,240
and they move and they say, come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away.

44
00:05:44,240 --> 00:06:14,000
Once I get you up there, where the air is where you are,

45
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:28,960
fly, we'll just fly, start. Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you a sword.

46
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:42,080
You made angels cheer cause we're together. Where the wise it's such a lovely day.

47
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:54,880
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to a book obey. It's perfect for flying

48
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,000
and they move and they say, come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly.

49
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,920
Back up, let's fly away.

50
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:30,560
You're going to mix them down to the earth once they're full.

51
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,880
Okay Nick, there's him, hey, hey, well, we're on the hill, dude.

52
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,880
I think I was hearing like, Chris the boat, Chris the boat, Chris the boat,

53
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:56,920
The Resonals at Pforce is still hot there.

54
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,200
And they say, sir, please.

55
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,840
We're right behind time now, but we're ready to go up in that park from K-10?

56
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Yeah, that blows.

57
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Yeah, excuse me.

58
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,840
You take air miles?

59
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Oh fuck.

60
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Yeah, the mooney is definitely not for big deal.

61
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Not for big guys.

62
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Okay.

63
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Actually, well, Nick is getting all that set up.

64
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Just check and make sure that we're recording here.

65
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Listen to my monitor system on the headphones.

66
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Hello? Yeah?

67
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Let me see. Yep.

68
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Check one, two, one, two. Yeah, beautiful. Okay.

69
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,840
So I've got the recording unit, the yep, with the receiver of my wireless mic,

70
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
in my bag on the back seat.

71
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,840
And I've got microphone clipped on.

72
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
I'm nibble to the both of them.

73
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Right on.

74
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Okay. On the side.

75
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,840
So I'll have to do some translation here, you know, Nick speaks.

76
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Excellent English.

77
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Building up the left wing tank.

78
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,840
So what do you tell us about the mooney 201, Nick?

79
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
It's a good plane.

80
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
This reliable one is fast.

81
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Isn't the Ferrari of the single engine piston?

82
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Yes, it is. Rob small on the side, but it's very comfortable in the plane.

83
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,840
It's sporty. That's not small. It's sporty.

84
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,840
It's a very clean AC off the aerodynamic wise.

85
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Yeah.

86
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
It's flying pretty fast.

87
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,840
32 liters, you can gain the speed of 150 knots.

88
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,840
150 knots, so that's 140 miles an hour.

89
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Yeah.

90
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
That's pretty good.

91
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Oh, they have a field gauge here.

92
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Cool.

93
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
It's a mechanical one.

94
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
You have an electronics one on the side.

95
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Yeah.

96
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,840
So many gallons total, 60, 70 gallons total.

97
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
You can fill it up.

98
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,840
One hand, 70 gallons total.

99
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
70 gallons total.

100
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Hello.

101
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,840
What's up here?

102
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
No, we have nothing to think about.

103
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,840
No, it doesn't matter.

104
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
That's not what I'm talking about.

105
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
That's somebody else.

106
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,840
No, that is not us, my dear.

107
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Okay. I love you.

108
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Okay.

109
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
I love you too.

110
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Bye.

111
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I was Patricia.

112
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
I wanted to know if we were already in the air,

113
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
because someone had been flying over the house,

114
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
doing some lazy eights.

115
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Nope, wasn't us.

116
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
And I've told everybody else.

117
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't do that.

118
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Just doesn't like the lazy eights.

119
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
She doesn't mind if you come out of the sky,

120
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
drop down with a helicopter and land and have some coffee.

121
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
That's okay.

122
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
She just doesn't like the lazy eights.

123
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Just standing here on the apron.

124
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,840
There's a huge, lots of swipes are actually coming up.

125
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Telecopter, three person.

126
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Looks like they're coming in for some deal.

127
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:34,840
That's actually kind of jet engine in that swipes.

128
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
It's mounted upside down in backwards.

129
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Really, it's like a little coffee.

130
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm like a tadpole.

131
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Not a pretty machine, that look at them.

132
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Doesn't job.

133
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,840
The entry and exit of the moon is...

134
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I can't forget it indeed.

135
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I can't forget it indeed.

136
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I can't forget it.

137
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I can't forget it.

138
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I can't forget it.

139
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I can't forget it.

140
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
I can't forget it.

141
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,840
It's the women with the short skirts that have the problems with that.

142
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I like them in the summer.

143
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Yeah, aha.

144
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Okay.

145
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I have one last one.

146
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Here goes the landing Michealду…

147
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
MEXRAPAIN

148
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm going to do a wee more, and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and then I'm

149
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:43,120
going to put my camera on and then I'm going to put the camera on and my camera on and then I'm going to put my camera on and if it hurts, it is going to hurt.

150
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
It's a bit of a nice to hold.

151
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
It's a bit too far.

152
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I've never been on level 5 started this before.

153
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,120
It's 2-4-1-18-0-8-9-9-8.

154
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
It's a time in 08.

155
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I'm a 9-8 set to start a pro for the mid-to-4.

156
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
And go even though it's a sexy hold.

157
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
I've never been on level 9.

158
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
If it takes you to throw it, I'll only do it.

159
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

160
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

161
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

162
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
This is a clear and start a pro.

163
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

164
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

165
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

166
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

167
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

168
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

169
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

170
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

171
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

172
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

173
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

174
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

175
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

176
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
I don't know if it's sexy.

177
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I wouldn't really like anything.

178
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
I look tired.

179
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
I think I'm behind you端

180
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
What's going on on top?

181
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Excellent.

182
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Thecription?

183
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,120
What are you doing out of there?

184
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I don't know who's on level 9.

185
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
It's an empty box.

186
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Follow me or be the pirate or pirate Oscar?

187
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Or dem Oscar?

188
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,120
The micro-clamming one thousand feet, stay 500 meters right outside of the roadway.

189
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,120
This is a few longs, here up your old car, so if you can open it, it's okay.

190
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
And then the button.

191
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Yeah.

192
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
So what are we going to do now?

193
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Okay.

194
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
We're going to come over here to come and go.

195
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Can we do it here?

196
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
We're going to do it again.

197
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,120
We're going to do it again.

198
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,120
We're going to go to the right field station.

199
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
We're going to line taxi and do nothing to do.

200
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
So what are we going to do?

201
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
We're going to do it.

202
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Okay.

203
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Are you going to put your boots on?

204
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Yeah.

205
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Yeah.

206
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Okay.

207
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Make sure to stay alive.

208
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Yeah.

209
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Okay.

210
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay.

211
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
Okay.

212
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Okay.

213
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Okay.

214
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
We're going to take the other direction.

215
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
That's just days and days about conditions.

216
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Okay.

217
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Okay.

218
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
We're going to go down.

219
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Okay.

220
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Okay.

221
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Okay.

222
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Okay.

223
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Okay.

224
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Okay.

225
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Okay.

226
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
We want to be prepared.

227
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Okay.

228
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
We want to be prepared.

229
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
No stay out of here alive.

230
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Yeah.

231
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
We want to go to the right field.

232
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Okay.

233
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Take my gear.

234
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Okay.

235
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Okay.

236
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Okay.

237
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I want to rotate and speed up this back.

238
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
We're about to flip it.

239
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Okay.

240
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Okay.

241
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay.

242
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Okay.

243
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Okay.

244
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Okay.

245
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Okay.

246
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Okay.

247
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I'm going to make one.

248
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Okay.

249
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Okay.

250
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Okay.

251
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:46,120
I'm on the way to the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the

252
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:56,440
Under the bottom of the bottom of the lower, up the bottom of the top of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the top of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the top of the bottom of the top of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom and bottom of the bottom of the bottom, and bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.

253
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
ㅋㅋㅋㅋit

254
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,100
Well i've been pushing it over it down for a couple of days

255
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,860
yeah, that sounds like you got under the bar nub.

256
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,820
yeah

257
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,980
damn

258
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,360
you out

259
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,560
its backlog

260
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,760
I know i think i saw a car

261
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,120
what did i film with?

262
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
Where?

263
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
The vehicle is right there.

264
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It's a place to take off.

265
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I might not know what you're talking about.

266
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Yeah, I might not know what you're talking about.

267
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know what you're talking about.

268
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
The wind is so weird, I think.

269
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,400
Okay, shall I have a list of them?

270
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Yeah, ready?

271
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,120
Can I go to the barrel and you can go to the station?

272
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,800
Yeah, I must have a bike right over there.

273
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay, that's more than sufficient.

274
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
That's okay.

275
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Make sure to don't get the roll.

276
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
The first minute case is alive is alive.

277
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
That's alive.

278
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Another minute.

279
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
You better know it's number eight.

280
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Everything is similar to my demo rules.

281
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Okay, if you're alive, you're not.

282
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
There are six minutes to go.

283
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
That's five.

284
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Seven zero.

285
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
If it nine, don't send nine.

286
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Seven zero.

287
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Okay, bro.

288
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Okay, that's the base.

289
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Be careful.

290
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Here's your tactic.

291
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
There's all the right to fly.

292
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
If it's up there, it's zero.

293
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Yeah, if it's okay.

294
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Okay, that's all the right.

295
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
If it's up there, it's five.

296
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Yeah, see a minute, I'll do it.

297
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Yeah.

298
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Yeah.

299
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Let's go, look at this one.

300
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Okay, if you're five up here, turn left now.

301
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Off drive the grids.

302
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
This is sufficient.

303
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
No much.

304
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Okay.

305
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
There we go.

306
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
There we go.

307
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Five to five.

308
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
There's seven hundred.

309
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
The level of a drop now.

310
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Okay.

311
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
On to the power.

312
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
You do the.

313
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
It's okay.

314
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Okay.

315
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Here it is.

316
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Okay, power.

317
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Yeah.

318
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Okay.

319
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Okay.

320
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Four.

321
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
One, two, one.

322
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Five.

323
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Four.

324
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Four.

325
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Two.

326
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Four.

327
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Three.

328
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Four.

329
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
One.

330
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Two.

331
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Two.

332
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Two.

333
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Four.

334
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Two.

335
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Okay, that's left.

336
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
One.

337
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:15,800
There's a railway track down there, and this is an highway up there, which is so built in the front of us.

338
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800

00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
It's a pressure that the engine starts.

519
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
So you can say it's a lot faster.

520
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm going to use the hazard.

521
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Okay, the valve is not too hot, yeah.

522
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Open the exhaust pressure on it.

523
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,800
That's right, right at factory control, yeah.

524
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
So lift it.

525
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
No, that was right, no problem.

526
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
That would be more direct.

527
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,800
If the clutch energy is on, then it doesn't hit tomorrow,

528
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
so it's like we alone do.

529
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,800
What's the bar on that?

530
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
I don't think we're gonna roll.

531
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Yeah.

532
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Move it.

533
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Do you want to play me in the name again?

534
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Yeah, I'll play you up.

535
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Uh, okay.

536
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
No, I'm glad we should actually see this.

537
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

538
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Okay, we call that traveler.

539
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Uh, Yeah, yes, yes, not working that way yet.

540
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Nice to meet you, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes , yes.

541
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

542
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Uh, yeah.

543
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Let's go!

544
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
The light is a little nervous too.

545
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Okay.

546
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
The noise is a little less nervous.

547
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Okay.

548
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh, that's it. That's it.

549
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Now we have an attitude.

550
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Yeah, how do we get rid of it?

551
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
That's all for now.

552
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
All you have to do is hit the corner.

553
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
That's it.

554
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Hey, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

555
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Open the window.

556
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You'll break eventually, right?

557
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah.

558
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
I think we should be close to the camera.

559
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Yeah.

560
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Wow, I was killed.

561
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Yeah.

562
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Yeah.
