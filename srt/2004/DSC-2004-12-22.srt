00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Hi podcasting daddy, Sunday class comes up to you this year and asks you Master of Artic.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,900
Then you know what the answer will be and how many presents you will get.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,400
Goethings from a German speaking luciant.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
Fantastic with Adam Curry.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,300
Ah, boy.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,800
Everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the daily source code coming from the fastest internet hotel in the world.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
That's the way they build themselves.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,400
This is your daily source code for Wednesday at December 22nd, 2004.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm Adam Curry in Uthman.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,600
How's it in the afternoon, it's 4.15.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
I slept a major portion of the day.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
I was so completely white after yesterday.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,100
I just, I know I slept for 13.14 hours.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,600
So I'm a little bit discombobulated, but I really wanted to get a source code done because

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,600
even when I went to bed last night, I had enough material and enough stuff to save.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,600
I could put you on your pack yesterday's day in the three source codes.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
But a lot of stuff to do outside of what's been going on here in Holland,

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
it is really cold here, by the way.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Yesterday it was minus 3 degrees and I decided after I visited my mom.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
By the way, medicine is amazing.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
What they can do is it just boggles the mind.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
And I don't know how to explain it.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
I'll tell you the scariest thing that happened to me yesterday.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Because there was actually a hole.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Let me get a little bit of Christmas vibe to hear all of that.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Let me get rid of the rock mining out there.

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Here we go.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Can you remember where I found all this stuff?

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I did a little bit of show prep this morning when I woke up before I went back to bed.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I found all kinds of Christmasy tunes.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I got to get into the holiday spirit, right?

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Links to all of the stuff of course in the production show.

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Anyway, my mom is doing great.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,600
All things considered considering they removed an entire lung.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
She has not changed.

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Her eyes are just as clear.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Her face.

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Everything is over speech.

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah, I think that today she was actually going to get out of bed or sit up.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Otherwise, just nothing changed.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Except for one thing that I told her I was going to talk about this in the podcast.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
She said, yes, she wouldn't put it pastly.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,600
But the scariest thing for me, the scariest thing was in the morning yesterday when I went to go see her.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
She was still in intensive care.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
She was just about to be taken out.

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
She spent the night there.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
And we walked.

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I met today before this.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
And Bob and I, her husband I walked in.

50
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
And she was there and she was, you know, it was my mom.

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
But it wasn't.

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,600
And I was like, oh my god, it's just looks horrible.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
And I realized that, of course, because of the operation,

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,600
she's normal is that they still not given her her teeth back.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Let me tell you, if you've never seen that, you've never seen your mom without her teeth.

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
It's like, man, it's just, it does not compute.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
And it was, at that moment, I was just, I was floored.

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
And I'm in intensive care.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
It's like, she looked okay, but she didn't look okay.

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,600
And whoa, it, that just totally, totally freaked me out.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
And if that was the only thing that had freaked me out,

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I think we're doing pretty damn good.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Hey, we fit it just perfectly in that beautiful little bit of Christmas music.

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Hello, Pete. Hello, Pete.

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,600
This is Rask Web Audio, of course, 2014.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Well, 18.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Well, folks, today we're going to talk about podcasting.

68
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Yeah.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm going to tell you the rules of podcasting.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
And there are rules.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
You need to follow this.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Rule number one.

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Always.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
No, no, wait, sorry.

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Never talk about podcasting.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Wait, hold on.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Hold on, hold on.

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I've got Russell Beatty's list of rules.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I want to find my list.

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Okay.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Number one.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Keep it short.

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Number two.

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Make sure the background music is not too loud.

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Otherwise, you can't really talk.

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Maybe keep the background music, not too loud.

87
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
That's very important.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
And, of course, number three, the most important.

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Always.

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Leave people wanting more.

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Pete, good old Pete Pardell.

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
We'll be hearing more about him from him later on in the podcast.

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You can tell I got a little bit of the sniffles now again because of this weather here.

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
And now, actually, the temperature just shot up to plus seven degrees.

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
So it's all over the map.

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I have no idea what's going on, but they were talking about a white Christmas here yesterday.

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And obviously, they're not anymore.

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
They also have this crazy thing in Holland, which it's called the Elf State of Tocht.

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
The 11 city skating competition.

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And it can only take place after the canals of frozen throughout the entire country for, you know,

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
X amount of days and they measured the ice.

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
And this is, this is really like Hans Brinker in the Silver Skates time.

103
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Okay.

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
And it's more or less like a marathon.

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It's a, I should look it up.

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It's several hundred kilometers.

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,600
And you skate on natural ice on canals, which means you have to either go under bridges or you have to do what's called

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Cluna, which is a certain type of crawling around the bridges.

109
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
So you get off the ice and so it's not to dull your blades.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
And you know, they do it on racing skates or the old fashioned wooden skates,

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,600
which are literally you strap these slats of wood to your shoes.

112
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
What's that noise?

113
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
I have the window open.

114
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,600
You strap these slats of wood to your shoes.

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
And they have a blade embedded in them.

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
And the last people who are hardcore and go, you know, like the old way.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Old school with the old fashioned skates, which is pretty amazing.

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I think the last time it happened was,

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
oh man, that must have been, I don't know, mate, was it 10 years ago?

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Or I mean, it really doesn't happen very frequently, particularly not with, you know, global warming, et cetera.

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
But whenever it gets cold like this, people start talking about that again.

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
So anyway, I'm here for a couple more days.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
In fact, I'm right after I record the podcast,

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm going to immediately drive off to the hospital.

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
My sister will always in from Italy.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
And she's in.

127
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,600
She was actually already planning to come over for the holidays with her husband, Alessandro,

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,600
and her, their two kids and my other sister Tiffany.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
So they're at, they're going to meet me at the hospital.

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Then we're going back when we have dinner, all the siblings.

131
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Wow, it's like a real family affair.

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
And, and it's so the season for it as well.

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Let's see what happened yesterday.

134
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I found a great coffee shop here in Utrecht called Vietstock.

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
So of course, that's a takeoff on Woodstock.

136
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,600
But it's Viet, W-I-E-T-S-T-O-K stock.

137
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
So it's like a stick of wheat.

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Real nice guys.

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,600
And it's apparently, it was voted the best coffee shop in the world,

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,600
or in in all of Holland by some American magazine, High Life, or High Times,

141
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
or then again, maybe it was boy's life.

142
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Can everybody remember?

143
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Time to learn.

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Good morning and welcome to today's podcast for December 22nd, 2004.

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,600
This is a brief daily podcast offering words for the wise and the otherwise.

146
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Yesterday's word got me thinking and reading about word creation

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
and where new words come from.

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
This of course led me to a new word, neologism.

149
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
NEO, L-O-G-I-S-M.

150
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
It is word that has two meanings.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
The first is a new word or term.

152
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
It can refer to a meaningful word like podcasting,

153
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
or it can be a nonsense utterance of an insane person.

154
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,600
The second meaning for neologism is the act of inventing a new word.

155
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
For example, the NBA types frequently use the word learnings

156
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
to describe observations or conclusions.

157
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Since learnings isn't a dictionary word,

158
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
they're unknowingly engaging in neologism.

159
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Any neologists out there?

160
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Send me your new words.

161
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600

Hi, it's Scott.

167
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Excellent.

168
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I love this podcast, by the way.

Neologism, neologism.

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Participating in neologism.

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
It's one to add to the list of sila liquies.

174
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Music for you today.

175
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
And I'm really concentrating on getting more pod safe music

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,600
on the show, getting more people involved in scouting out good

177
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
songs.

178
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
And there's been some recent, some press recently.

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
I think that is getting other people excited in that as well.

180
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,600
And of course, if you heard the morning coffee notes that we discussed,

181
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
the Dave did about us finding the next beetles.

182
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
You know, the beetles are pod casting.

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Well, and maybe we should, this is the last time.

184
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Hold on.

185
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
It's very difficult.

186
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I found to put your glasses on if you had headphones on.

187
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Because they kind of, let me go.

188
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
That's better.

189
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
We're never going to talk about the next beetle of pod casting ever again.

190
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Because that's just kind of, let's just find some superstars.

191
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Okay.

192
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I got some candidates lined up for you in this particular show.

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Let's start with American Heartbreak.

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I was reading through Michael Butler's Weblog.

195
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
And there was a blur about an American Heartbreak song that they were

196
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
releasing pod safe RIA free.

197
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
And it's, you know, it's hard to get new Christmas songs.

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
They just don't make enough of them.

199
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Go, American Heartbreak.

200
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Do you remember that in down my Christmas tree?

201
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Don't remember anything.

202
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
But made it for my phone to make.

203
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Wake up and I'm freezing.

204
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Drink it doesn't kill my thing.

205
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Children spinning at my window must be Christmas time again.

206
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Don't start with American Heartbreak.

207
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
No wish I could meet.

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I was dreaming never again.

209
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Every year the same.

210
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
But those night, I'm gonna be.

211
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas.

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm gonna be.

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas.

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Live my life and nothing.

215
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
To face another year.

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
You can be a fool compared to a night.

217
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Be dead by Christmas anyway.

218
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Be with Christmas party.

219
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
You're the the other way.

220
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
And wish I was never born.

221
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
See another Christmas day.

222
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Just go and remember.

223
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
No wish I could meet.

224
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I was dreaming never again.

225
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Every year the same.

226
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
But those night, I'm gonna be.

227
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas.

228
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I'm gonna be.

229
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas again.

230
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm gonna be.

231
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas.

232
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm gonna be.

233
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I'm gonna be never born.

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,600
No wish I could meet.

235
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Wake up in a recent.

236
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Take it doesn't kill my pain.

237
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Tell me if you didn't have my window.

238
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Must be Christmas time again.

239
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
See another Christmas party.

240
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
But yeah it's over the year.

241
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I wish I was never born.

242
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,600
See another Christmas year.

243
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Just go and remember.

244
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
No wish I could meet.

245
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I was dreaming never again.

246
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Every year the same.

247
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
But those night, I'm gonna be.

248
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas.

249
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'm gonna be.

250
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas again.

251
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm gonna be.

252
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm gonna be by myself with Christmas.

253
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,800
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be alone

254
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,520
and I'm gonna miss the same

255
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,340
I'm gotta be alone

256
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,800
No more Christmas day

257
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,340
And I'm gonna be alone

258
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,240
No more Christmas day

259
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,500
Lying on Christ my stares

260
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:45,540
Yeah, it's a nice uplifting, a little holiday cheer to the African-American heartbreak,

261
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:55,820
Christmas song, a new daily source code, excellent, excellent, you know, and it's hard

262
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,220
to get good new Christmas songs, you know, it really is, it's just difficult because everyone

263
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,500
always plays the standards and the traditional's over and over and over again and then it's

264
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
good.

265
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
We need one for our generation.

266
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,460
Thank you very much, American heartbreak for that, perfect, absolutely perfect, and I

267
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,900
got to take, I like Christmas, I really do, not for any religious reasons, I'm

268
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:28,380
sorry, I do have some flammage in my throat, just the light, you know, so let's just call

269
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,900
the Festival of Lights or whatever, because it's a whole bunch of holidays and religious

270
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,780
lights, things going on around this time of year, but it's kind of nice, and here in New

271
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:45,420
Threat, the National Top 40 Radio Station, so that's a public radio, public broadcast, they

272
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,820
have, it's called 3 FM, so they have a 24 hour radio station, which is kind of like BBC's

273
00:15:49,820 --> 00:16:00,220
radio one, they're doing a big thing for Darfur, and they've caged three of their top

274
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,540
DJs, one of them girl Claudia, in this glass studio on the kind of the Nuda, which is a

275
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,860
central square here in New Threat, and they're broadcasted from their live 24 hours a day,

276
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,340
and it's all lit, you know, so you can basically see the whole studio, and they have guests,

277
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,860
the trick is that they're basically playing all requests all the time, but you have to, you

278
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,780
have to donate money to Darfur, so people are calling up, it's like, oh, it's a tell-out

279
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:36,460
though, on a radio, a radio thorn, I guess, but to give it an extra twist, they are, you

280
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,780
know, I guess, in all of the field of the world, and identify the hunger vibe, they're not

281
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,660
eating for five days, so they went in Monday morning, and they don't come out and tell Friday

282
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,540
afternoon, I think, or six p.m., and they will not have eaten anything for the entire week,

283
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,980
they drink water, food juices, they're, I mean, they're drinking tea, they're drinking coffee,

284
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,780
the drinking Coca-Cola for crisis, which is not, not very good, and even worse than that,

285
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,700
is they're smoking, they're, I mean, they're all smokers, so of course they're substituting

286
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,900
the hunger with a drag on a cigarette, man, I told them, you guys got stuff, and say,

287
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,020
now they have doctors on site, and they have a, you know, a whole medical program worked

288
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,660
out, but yeah, the doctors had mentioned that we shouldn't smoke so much with it, anyway,

289
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,260
so I, I just happened to walk by, and they, they call me in, and so it was on the air,

290
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,260
and it was, it was kind of interesting, it was, especially because I just come from the

291
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,500
coffee shop, you know, then to be live on the radio, I was like, well, you know, I got

292
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,100
it, I don't know, I don't know, that's exactly what I thought, I don't know, but I told

293
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,500
him, I said, look, try this out, why don't you, for a week, give your dog a bowl of Coca-Cola,

294
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,300
and a couple cigarettes every day, and let's see how, how he looks at the end of the

295
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
week.

296
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,740
Well, I tried to tell him what, you know, Don always says, but this was kind of like the

297
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,540
clean radio version of it, right?

298
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,820
Hey, there's no, it's a new movie podcast that I thought was kind of interesting.

299
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Howdy listeners, welcome to Family Reviews, the podcast where our family gets together and discusses

300
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,980
movies available at your local centerplex, for rental or on television, or on the web at

301
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,620
familyreviews.blogspot.com, stop by, give us some comments.

302
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,620
I want to say about Oceans 12, except that it's up there.

303
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,500
So here's the deal, so they, they, oh my, once I only reset my mic, okay, back, that's better.

304
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,940
Here's the deal, the family reviews a movie.

305
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,740
You get the, you get the, just, just listen to it for a second, listen to the different

306
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
family.

307
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,180
There's a movie where somewhere, somebody along the production area, so taking a look

308
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,340
to the script and said, I'm sorry, we can't make this and do a motion picture to

309
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
that.

310
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,660
They shot that thing in Amsterdam, by the way, which is so typical that we, all of Holland

311
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,340
was so incredibly excited about Oceans 12 being done in the Netherlands and, you know,

312
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,740
George Clooney and Brad Pitt all staying at, you know, at the Amstel Hotel for weeks

313
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,740
on end and all the celebs.

314
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,980
And of course, this is going to be the movie that sucks, right?

315
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,140
This is going to be the ishtar of, of, of, of these actors career, and this is the big

316
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,820
moment for Holland to shine.

317
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,060
If you ignore the critics and go see this movie, you're doing it at your own peril because

318
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
it is just a bad film.

319
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:45,220
The movie is a sequel to, both in the 11, which I thought was, no, this is the movie.

320
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,180
Wait, was there a deal at the Amstel, for, for good will, didn't?

321
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
What the hell is that?

322
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,460
I want to hear the other people review and comment.

323
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
No, no.

324
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,100
Okay, anyway, listen to the family reviews, because it's, I think it's the first, review, podcast

325
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,100
that I've heard.

326
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,860
Of course, we have real, real reviews, which is Michael Gohagan, hey, got it right

327
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:11,820
the first time, like, but he doesn't necessarily do new movies, so anyway, and he's not

328
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
just reviewing.

329
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,100
He's going in depth about the movies.

330
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
It's a totally different vibe.

331
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:24,100
There was a comment that came in on, on the website at curie.com, Mike wanted to know,

332
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,100
Mike says he's actually moving from PC to a Mac, specifically for podcasting, makes

333
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,460
sense, busy at looking what to buy, he says, can you spare a few valuable podcast minutes?

334
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,020
He'd really be interested to hear what hardware I'm, and software I'm running my podcast

335
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
on.

336
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,900
Actually, we haven't talked about this in a while, how I record these, so I'll give you

337
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,100
this set up real briefly.

338
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,180
There's a hardware and a software part to it, so I'm just, I have regular power book

339
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,180
G4, he said, Blase, a regular power book G4.

340
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,940
Although this one has been around the block, it's chipped, it's broken, the hinges are

341
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,580
a bit cramogeney, you know, pretty soon, it'll be time for a new one.

342
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:14,420
What I do is I run audio hijack pro, and I have attached through Firewire, an M audio,

343
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,620
Firewire 410 breakout box.

344
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,340
Basically, I just use that as an audio input for my SureSM7 microphone, which is a professional

345
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,740
broadcast microphone, but you could use any mic, but this is about what I'm using.

346
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:35,220
So that's plugged into the M audio, and so basically that comes up as an audio device,

347
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,740
which you can capture in audio hijack pro.

348
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,700
I send the output of the hijack to the headphones, because I want to have a good volume,

349
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,500
so I can hear everything.

350
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I use audio hijack pro now to record in AFF to direct to the hard disk, and that works

351
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,500
because AFF, well first of all, it doesn't have to compress anything on the fly, so it's

352
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,700
basically writing raw data out to the hard drive, so it won't skip if some heavy processes

353
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,340
hit my computer for some reason, and also should the computer crash, the file will still

354
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,620
be there, and I can always start recording again, and just add the two bits together,

355
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,580
whereas with an MP3 recording direct to disk, you might lose all that information, in fact,

356
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,860
you probably will lose it, and so I always compress my files after the fact.

357
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:33,100
The M audio has a button on it, which basically switches the input from a mic to a line,

358
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,020
and I use that just to turn off my microphone when, for instance, the song is playing or something

359
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,460
out, so I'll demonstrate, so that's just me pressing that button on and off.

360
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,580
Then I've got a couple of effects, you can put effects into your audio channel in audio hijack

361
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,180
pro, so essentially I'm processing my voice with the first with a monomizer, which because I'm

362
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,460
only using one channel of the M audio, it makes one channel, so basically it takes one channel

363
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,060
and makes it into a mono to two channels, then I have a compressor running light compression,

364
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,020
there's a 10 band EQ that I used to equalize the voice a little bit, and then of course,

365
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,980
I have very little bit of reverb, it's there, it's hardly noticeable, but it's there, and it makes

366
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,420
a difference, and then I have the spectrifier, which just gives me a visual representation, so I know

367
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,940
that something's going through the whole audio, that's at the end of the chain, so I know that

368
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,700
if it's made it through there, then it's probably being recorded to disk, but in between there,

369
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:41,420
I've inserted the voice over module, and what's cool about that is I'm not using, see what I was

370
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,460
trying before, I was trying to capture quick time, and then use the voice over module to insert my

371
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,580
microphone, so now basically I'm concentrating completely on the mic, that's running through the whole main chain,

372
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,020
and then I just add sound flower, this is my sound like gobbledy group to so many people,

373
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,900
I'll shut up in a second, I add sound flower 16 in the voice over module, and I basically,

374
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:15,660
here it comes, I gotta document this differently, then I use detour, audio detour, this is crazy,

375
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:23,500
I use detour to send quick time output to sound flower 16, okay, you get it, you got it,

376
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,460
good, because I'm not sure I understand any more either, hello Adam, this is Murlaferty with my podcast

377
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,980
geek food action grip, and I'm here to answer a call that you had for short podcast, and answer a

378
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:45,100
call that Dave Slusher from Evil Genius Chronicles had for Southern women podcasts, so I'm here with my

379
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:51,660
short Southern female podcast called geek food action grip, and I'm using the podcast to read my

380
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,580
essays that have been some published, some unpublished, but most of them hopefully humorous,

381
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,980
and I promise to keep the podcast under 10 minutes, you can find my blog and my podcast at

382
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:12,060
essentialmath.com slash geek food, that's one word, thanks a lot, you know, this is once again

383
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,540
demand making its own supply, and that's great, I mean so I asked for something, Dave Slusher

384
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,100
asks for something, and all of a sudden it appears, and I suggest you check that podcast out,

385
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,980
lots of podcasts by the way being added to the ipodder.org directory, as I'm starting to get some

386
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,140
technical bits together, and I have different ways of bringing all this information in to make sure

387
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,140
that wherever a new podcast pops up on any directory or any, any node of our directory that

388
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,340
it basically can float to the top, and that you can be alerted about it on ipodder.org, so it's kind of a

389
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,260
throwback, I guess, to the NCSA, what's new page, remember that? Back in the day, so, you know,

390
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,580
if you want to know what the podcasts and what the new ones are, and of course there's the

391
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,500
audio.weblogs.com page. If you're new to podcasting, this is a great place to let people know about

392
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,580
your podcasts as well, but you have to basically tell this service that you have a podcast that's

393
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,100
updated. There's instructions there on ipodder.org, how to create a feed, how to ping

394
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:20,780
audio.weblogs.com, and it's worth it, because that's a good place to, it's just like,

395
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,700
if you go to look at weblogs.com, the whole world is pinging that as well, and even Microsoft stuff

396
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,060
pingsweblogs.com, so that's just a good central place that I wouldn't know, hey, you know,

397
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:39,020
I've got an update happening here. Something to go on in secret for many weeks now, it shouldn't

398
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,100
have taken many weeks, but that was probably mainly my fault. The 12 days of podcasting projects

399
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,540
set up by Pete Pradele of Raster Web with Don and Drew of the Don and Drew Show, and they selected

400
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,380
a whole bunch of podcasts. I'm not that I'm allowed to tell you, but I don't really remember who they all

401
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:03,500
were. A lot of pioneers, I think, and early, early podcasters, and they came up with lyrics,

402
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,140
and everyone had to do their, you know, day of podcasting, and they're putting this all together.

403
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,020
What I really didn't realize though, I thought, of course, I didn't read the instructions properly,

404
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,100
and I was busy with all kinds of other things. I thought, I was just supposed to do,

405
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,300
I'm doing the first day of podcasting, and I thought I just had to do one line, and I did a

406
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,420
couple different reads of it, and I sent the whole file off to Drew. I didn't know that these files

407
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,180
were being put out verbatim, unedited, because I listened to it. I was like, oh, and I thought

408
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,780
they were going to be put into the music immediately, but I guess what's happening now is

409
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,780
every day, we're going to release a day of podcasting, and then at the end, we'll

410
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:45,340
be January 1st, there will be a whole entire mix of the 12 days of podcasting. Check out

411
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,740
Donandru.com for information on it. I'm also posting a link in the show notes, of course, for today's show.

412
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,500
I'm not going to play you mine, because I'm not a singer, it's horrible, and I hate doing this,

413
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,620
but I didn't want to be a party pooper. I will, of course, play you a bit of Donandru

414
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,860
who pick up the second day of podcasting. I'll tell you at least what my, what my lyric is,

415
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:14,460
my lyric is, on the first day of podcasting, Dave Winer gave to me an enclosure in an XML tree.

416
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,620
Okay, ready?

417
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,500
Mm-hmm.

418
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Kind of three, one, two, three.

419
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,660
On the second day of podcasting, I'm a part of it.

420
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:33,100
Okay, I'm the second day of podcasting, I'm a part of it to me.

421
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,260
See, Donandru, punk's a cousin.

422
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
All right, no, let's do the punk's a cousin.

423
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,060
Okay, ready?

424
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,460
Mm-hmm.

425
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:46,860
On the second day of podcasting, I'm a part of it to me, to punk's a cousin.

426
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,900
And you guys should have done harmonies. Come on, huh?

427
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,460
And so anyway, they're putting this together.

428
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,860
And my secret hope is that other people, you know, who like messing around with audio on their

429
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,660
computer will, you know, take these daily files and perhaps create an alternative mix to

430
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,340
whatever this is supposed to be. So stay tuned for that.

431
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,820
And of course, I'll be playing you these little days of podcasting snippets as they come along.

432
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,420
Now, the Donandru show, they picked up a sponsor, not too long ago.

433
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:26,060
I think it's MSMobles.com and they, I think that's the, that's the person who's sponsoring them,

434
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:35,020
but it's about Mike, it's basically a whole website or a project about Microsoft mobile devices.

435
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,980
And so I went to the website, MSMobles.com, I suggested, and there's a podcast there as well.

436
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,620
And this is just confusing to me. I want to know more about MSMobles now.

437
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,300
And I know this guy is, as email me, we've, we've come back and forth before, but

438
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,860
I mean, is this a Microsoft company or a Microsoft consultancy or

439
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,740
one thing for sure, the podcast is interesting.

440
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,100
Do not listen to this eyes closed process while striving or operating machinery, only listen

441
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,340
when you can safely relax completely.

442
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,700
Well, come to MSMobles.com.

443
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,820
That sounds like, um, what's the name of that's, uh, the dog on Conan O'Brien?

444
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,500
What is the, uh, insult coming dog? Is that it?

445
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,820
Do you understand?

446
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,540
That's iPhone's are important.

447
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,620
In this podcast, I would be. Could it be that Microsoft actually understands what we're doing

448
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,020
already that they actually get, this is great. I mean, this is a Microsoft commercial that I'm

449
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,340
interested in listening to about latest news from the area.

450
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,420
If you would only put on that was.

451
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,060
Enjoy. Okay.

452
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:25,500
Okay. And then what was, all right. Well, go listen to that podcast too, because

453
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,380
it's trippy. So, um, I'm not quite sure what's going on there.

454
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,300
I hopefully will get some audio information about MSMobles and the sponsorship and how that's

455
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:43,340
working. I'm delighted for Donna Drew that they've got a sponsorship, um, but I think that

456
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,340
what I'm hearing is this podcast is better than the commercial that, you know, or the mentions they

457
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,300
do on the show. Maybe they should get this guy on and get him to do some, do some of that wacky stuff.

458
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,740
I don't know. Just different ways of looking at commercialization, eh?

459
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,420
Hello. I'm Ken Strugian. I'm here to tell you about our brand new Ken N.

460
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:05,260
Squip show holiday extravaganza. The festivities include me pushing Squip over the edge with my new

461
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,100
Pupu Santa and then going completely bonkers for bosoms. For some reason, the thing that popped

462
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:19,100
up to the top was this great big huge breasts. I mean, big boobs, big melons, big hawkers.

463
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:26,540
Ken? Yeah. Sounds more like a popped breast implant. Ken, what the hell is with you in the breasts?

464
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,820
Are you suddenly breast crazy? Well, I thought you were going to say I had to send my

465
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:38,060
Pupu Santa to Dave Kendall. Oh, for God's sake, human and stupid bull. And there was like a

466
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:43,020
disclaimer, my long about how use of this product could cause sudden uncontrollable liquid bowel

467
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:51,100
movements. Ken? Yeah. You are preoccupied with poop, and now it's this breast thing. What the hell

468
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,340
is wrong? Take your pick, which is worse. Squip serves up a new recipe for a delightful holiday

469
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,940
Mexican man killed his lover in a drunken fight, then cooked the man's body in tomato and

470
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:13,820
uninsuas. And ate it over three days. Oh, my. The victim, a young man, arrived at his cardboard hut.

471
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:25,180
His cardboard hut. That's right. Well, the corpse, which had it to back, ripped open and it's

472
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:32,700
inner. It's called a very important story. Go with that. And then explains how you can use your cell

473
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,740
phone as a marital aid. Who made six toys.com offers instructions for using your cell phone as a

474
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:46,140
vibrator. It also provides practical tips such as using a condom if you plan to put the phone

475
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,180
inside you or if you want to talk on the phone later. What do they mean? Could you talk on the

476
00:33:51,180 --> 00:34:05,340
phone with an opio? That's this week only on the Kenan Squip Show. Available at www.dustingmybrain.com

477
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:17,420
slash KASS. Podcasting may never be the same. And I believe I've mentioned that the

478
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:22,700
Kenan Squip Show consists of two of my dear friends who have jumped on to the podcast in

479
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,180
craze. Ken was my personal assistant for years before that he worked at MTV's The Talent

480
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:36,140
Coordinator and VP of Talent Pupu and later he ran entire divisions at Think New Ideas. He's

481
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:42,540
been in my life for many, many years and he's completely nuts. Cindy was one of my first employees

482
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:51,260
at my company on ramp and she's a beautiful, wonderful human being and the only employee who's

483
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,780
ever thrown up on me in a drunken stupor and I love them both dearly. Hey dudes, I'm going to go

484
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:03,020
off to the hear me. Hey dudes, how you doing? I'm going to go off and meet my sisters at the hospital.

485
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,900
I'm going to hang out with my mom so that'll be the kids and mom all together. I got another great

486
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,740
podsafe song for you. This is a guy named Roger. He has a band called Intwin. I&TWI&E

487
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:21,020
Intwin and I've played this song probably in one of the first daily source codes or maybe

488
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:26,620
it was pre-sourced code I think that I probably put an MP3 up on my weblog when I was doing the

489
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,500
radio show for Radio Veronica the morning radio show. So yeah it predates my podcasts.

490
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Roger was, he basically has this band and he put together his own little marketing

491
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,580
play at the band in the Netherlands. Although I think he I can't remember he lived in Canada

492
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:55,900
or the states for a couple years. His English is excellent. He's just you know good looking

493
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:04,460
kid very talented got the voice you know he could have been from you know California who knows.

494
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:11,980
So he's kind of like stuck in Holland. What what his plan was is he went on pop idol or

495
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:19,340
yeah the Dutch version of American Idol and went through the audition process and he was selected

496
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,540
to go into the you know the semifinals or whatever and he said you know I'm not going to do it

497
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,540
because I don't want to sign the contract you gave me and so the you know there was this big

498
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,460
there was the first the first series of the show. So of course the media got onto it and it

499
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:40,140
was all a marketing play because he had no intention of actually going through with with the entire

500
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,500
contest he just wanted people to hear about his his band and of course he got a record deal out of it

501
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,100
and they released a song which was very successful in Holland and it just it didn't go anywhere

502
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,300
and that can be timing that can be a number of factors but it doesn't have to do it doesn't necessarily

503
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:02,220
have anything to do with the quality of the song and this is a song that I've permissioned to play

504
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:09,980
on the podcast and it would be you know awesome if other people other podcasts pick this up and

505
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,340
played the song. I think you like it it's a shoot now you could hear this on any radio station anywhere

506
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:22,940
shoot strange the stars don't shine the rock is now soon to go and try to happen

507
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:32,220
isn't it strange that we can't love back and seeing and just what went wrong I want to know now

508
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:43,020
when we are should I pretend in a little thing you know when what you've done could you

509
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:53,660
come face to your face with me isn't it strange that you told me one thing suddenly change your mind

510
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:04,060
isn't it strange that you come out for me turn away and leave me behind now if he's like I'm drowning

511
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:17,500
he's like I'm drowning in a way without you I know the feeling because I felt it's all before

512
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:29,340
I hope you don't feel just like me I hope you don't feel just like me I hope you don't feel just like me

513
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,900
I hope you don't I be

514
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:44,700
isn't it strange that the world seems to turn away when I try and explain what's all strange

515
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:52,060
then two can be as one yet another same and if he's like I'm drowning

516
00:38:52,140 --> 00:39:05,820
feel like I'm drowning in a way without you I know the feeling because I felt it's all before

517
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:17,980
and if he's like I'm drowning in a way without you I hope you don't feel just like me

518
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:30,220
I hope you don't feel just like me I hope you don't feel just like me I hope you I'll be

519
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:46,780
don't feel just like me I hope you don't feel just like me I hope you don't feel just like me

520
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,780
We'll be with just like that, man

521
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,780
I hope you don't feel just like that

522
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,780
But I hope that was real much and wasn't that bad

523
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,780
Maybe not to love it

524
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,780

It's just a sleeping for 13, 14 hours

538
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,780
Really threw me off a little bit

539

We've got the family and we've got to do this

543
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,780
That's kind of what you want to try to do

544
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,780
During this time of the years, hang out with me

545
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,780

546
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
And see if there's something about it

547
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,780
