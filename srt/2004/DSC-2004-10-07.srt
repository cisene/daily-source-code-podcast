00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello there friends, family, go-

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm Adam Curry, welcome you to the Thursday edition.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today is October 7th, 2004 and we're ready to rock.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We got some interesting things happening today.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And that would be the fact that we're going to be doing a video about the

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
two days. Once again life has kind of gotten in the way of doing the podcast. I told you

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
yesterday it takes about an hour and a half these days to get everything queued up and

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
get everything pre-produced and then it takes at least half an hour, sometimes an hour or

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
longer to get the show going. And then another hour to make sure the compression is done

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
right and get up to the server. And today life got in the way of all the

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to the flat screen factory for a shareholders meeting.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Which means I've been on the road all day.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right now it is sort of living at 640.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am at Skippal Airport in the parking garage in my car.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm just going to buckle in here.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OK.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I had to.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, you know it's one of these things.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know if it's the same way in the States, but if you

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
want to get more than 250 euros, so about, what is that

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
these days, about $290.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you want to get more than $300 from a cash

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
machine from an ATM, you have to go to a bank.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Banks, of course, suck because they know

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the touristy close way too early.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So the only other place to get anything above that amount

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
is at Skippal Airport, which is kind of conveniently

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
on the way home.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, not really convenient.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
From here it's one road home.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I'm just about to look at the, I'm in my Audi.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have an Audi A8.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Love this car.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's got all the gadgets you want.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's got all the technology.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yet it's kind of boring.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not really sexy.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now I have been my navigation here.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me just see.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to set up for actually.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,500
start the car first. Okay, I'm going to set it up, take me to the castle, hold on,

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
there we go. And I'm not gonna put the guidance voice on because that's that's

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,500
kind of wacky. Although actually my, well now I'm not gonna do that. Okay, that means

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,500
top-up washer fluid. Okay, let me just check my my route here and go to, okay,

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
so Amsterdam Delft, I'm gonna get on the A4, 3,

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
between Delph. Okay, so it shouldn't be too bad. Let me see if there's a traffic report

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
memo.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
On 35 files in the meester, they're high from 5 km long.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, so there's 35 traffic jams. Each one is about...

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Each one is about 5 km. What's cool about this traffic system is that it actually records

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the traffic reports from the radio. So on all the stations here in...

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Most of them in Europe actually, when there's a traffic report, they hit a button

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
so it'll interrupt your radio no matter what station or CD you're listening to.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But this car actually also records, and I have a list of like...

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I had about 10 traffic reports there, each about 5 minutes apart.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey, you know what? It's traffic. You're basically fucked no matter what.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Tell you what, I'm going to get out of the garage here,

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and meanwhile why don't we crank up some driving music, sniffing...

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Drive and see

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ooh, drive and see

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Drive and see

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ooh, drive and see

64
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Yeah, sniffing the tears, driver's seat on your right.

65
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sorry about that. It's kind of hard to drive and switch stuff at the same time.

66
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, now we're all set up. Okay, so I'm out of the parking garage. I am now

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
twirling. I want to get out of here people. Okay, you know what's great about

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
these navigations systems? Hold on a second. Let me just remove the

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
earphones. Oh boy. Come on people. Let my hand. Let my hand. Here we go. What's great

70
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
about these navigation systems is that when the road is changed as frequently

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
happens at airports then it gets really confused about where to send you but I

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
just follow the signs now. Okay, so I've got about well depending on traffic let

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
me see right now it's eight minutes seven and I'll be arriving at 825 now that's

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if there's no traffic whatsoever so I don't even think my laptop battery is

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
gonna kind of keep it up.

76
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
up for that long. So we'll probably just be able to get a good hour showing because there

77
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,500
is a lot to talk about today. And what was nice on the way up, I had some time to check

78
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,500
out some podcasts. I've got to tell you, this has really taken off ever since I really

79
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,500
started focusing on the podcast directory, which of course can be found on iPodder.org.

80
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,500
It just keeps on coming. I mean, I think this morning I added another five. Yesterday

81
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
I must have added 10 or 15. And that's just the people have everything

82
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,500
all together. I'm getting daily requests for additions to the directory

83
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,500
from people who have a show that they have on their site or linked from

84
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
somewhere, but they don't have a feed-up yet. And trying to help most of those

85
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
people, most of them are getting helped out one way or the other.

86
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Just close the roof there, give us a little bit of sound.

87
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,500
So I listened to some really good shows and obviously I was able to start

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
sniffing a tear song and I probably can do the theme song at the end of the show.

89
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's a little too much to be cruising through segments and pulling out bits today.

90
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But I do have my iPod handy.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And what I'll do is I just want to talk about a few of these podcasts because it's just

92
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
so lovely.

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then when I get home, I'll edit in just a couple of bits so you can hear what's

94
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
up.

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So it's almost live.

96
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's live on tape, right?

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So first there's the Dawn and Drew show, a husband and wife team, which just

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
cracked me up.

99
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And it's good to hear a woman's voice on a podcast.

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And so far it's been men, men, men, men, men.

101
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And so they just kind of shoot the breeze.

102
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But they're fighting together.

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know, when you have a husband and wife team that have known each other

104
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
for a while, when they talk, they kind of feel in the blanks and they can

105
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
also rank on each other a bit from the Dawn and Drew show.

106
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Welcome to the Dawn and Drew show.

107
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm John Misselli and I'm Drew.

108
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
And this is our show.

109
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,500
That's right.

110
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
So listen up bitches!

111
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Enjoy!

112
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
This evening, the role of Drew Domkis will be played by James.

113
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Welcome to the Don and Drew Show.

114
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm Drew Domkis and broadcasting live from the satellite of love.

115
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
That's right.

116
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm Don Micelli.

117
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
For this evening, the role of Don Micelli will be played by Chris Moore.

118
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
The Don and Drew Show and if you want to subscribe to that podcast, real easy just

119
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
go to iPodder.org.

120
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Go into the download and shows directory and you can find it right there.

121
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
And the way I'm doing it now, although I'm going to start to split it up into

122
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,500
different categories, is every single time as a new show added to the directory, it'll

123
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
be listed on top.

124
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
So it's kind of reverse chronological order.

125
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Oops, I just, I'm going to believe this.

126
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,500
I just remembered that I have to make a pit stop in between here and home.

127
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,500
So basically I'm driving from Amsterdam via Rotterdam to Belgium.

128
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,500
It's one straight line, but I have to stop off about three quarters of the way in

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you're ever in Breda, B-R-E-D-A in the Netherlands, Breda, lovely town.

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There's a coffee shop there called Purple Rain.

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's where my Moroccan buddies are.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And, well, it's time for another refill.

133
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Moving on with some cool podcasts, I found...

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
just find it of course you know every single one I add to the directory I pretty much

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
subscribe to it at least

136
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The Rock and Roll Geek Show. Now this is hosted by Michael Butler and Michael

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Butler is the bass player for a band which I don't think I might have heard

138
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
them before American Heartbreak. They've been around for about seven years and

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
what I liked about this podcast is what Michael's doing and by the way what is

140
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
it with bass players who are named Butler? Have you ever hear of Giza

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Butler? Black Sabbath? So Michael is doing a little bit differently. Instead of

142
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
recording a complete show he records little bits and they'll just pick it up.

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So it's kind of like a diary and well here's a bit of him in the

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
morning after he went to a show the night before for the New York

145
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Dolls and here's how he was feeling. It's Tuesday morning, the day after the

146
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
New York Dolls show.

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I am so...

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
tired.

149
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
way to work and I do not want to be here.

150
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Now of course, Al was not lost.

151
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
He might have felt really crappy.

152
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
But he also got a great ID for the show.

153
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
And when we talk about IDs in the radio business, that basically means, hi, I'm Phil on the

154
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
blank celebrity name.

155
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,500
You're listening to Phil on the blank radio program name.

156
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,500
And our buddy Michael got one from David Johansson at the New York Dolls.

157
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,500
This is David Johansson and you're listening to.

158
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Unfortunately, the Rock and Roll Geek show.

159
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
The only thing that was missing from that is, you should have said you're listening to the

160
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Rock and Roll Geek podcast.

161
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
But all right, close enough.

162
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
So anyway, so Michael really does this whole thing and I don't know what it is with him

163
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,500
and his wife, but he keeps threatening that his wife, who he says doesn't understand

164
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
what he's doing and probably doesn't agree with what he's doing.

165
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
He's taping it all in his bedroom.

166
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Whenever she comes in, they start nagging each other and he keeps threatening to

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
record a whole session.

168
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So we still have that to look forward to.

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But really nice was a bit that he added onto the show, which

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
was a recording of.

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
On KSFU, which is a college radio station, promoting a show that they were doing,

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and also played a couple of songs from their album, which I think they may be on some independent labels.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Europe. Here's the traffic jam. I'm already seeing that we're slowing down to a crawl.

174
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's good. Give me some time to queue up some stuff even if we really come to a standstill.

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What was nice about hearing the College Radio show interview was that all of a sudden it

176
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
hit me. Do you remember, and many of you will, back in the 80s, certainly at MTV,

177
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
primarily, College Radio was always cool. The buzz. College Radio is playing this.

178
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This is up and coming. College Radio is cool to listen to because it's basically almost

179
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
uncensored. It's non-commercial. It's just kids having fun and people saying the truth

180
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and playing their heart out and getting their chops down. It reminds me so much of what

181
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we're doing with podcasting with one major difference is that College Radio,

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
you can only really hear College Radio when you're near the College Radio station.

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In case of you, I'm sure has a huge transmitter, but when I was in...

184
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Salem, West Virginia, I went to Salem College and we had a 10 watt sunup, sundown FM transmitter.

185
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It would just kind of do the town of Salem.

186
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And what was the call letters?

187
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It was WITB, which depending on what, if you're on the day air shift or the night air shift, the day shift meant we're in the

188
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
shift of course since we're into Bong heads that was my my college radio days

189
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I still have my you know the varsity jacket from the radio station WA TV air

190
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
personality and curry bullet so but it was cool and and college radio is cool

191
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and these podcasts hey someone someone's holding up his iPod hold on roll on your

192
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
window I'm just taking off to name here come here

193
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
wait yeah

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
but a month or okay dude yeah right dude we checked out a guy just drove up next to

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
me and he's honking his horn and he's holding his iPod up and he's saying I'm

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
listening

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
God damn, I said I'm recording one right now. So Raymond buddy

198
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wow, that's very cool. See this is what I mean. This is what it's all about. Oh, that gives me a boost of energy

199
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's fucking great. Okay, so so this is what it's like, you know, it's it's college radio only work clearly

200
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We're mobile in more ways than one so

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
American heartbreak I really like the songs that these guys are making you know, it's it's very 80s

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Intended to be that way and I think the guys probably were around in the 80s

203
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They played in a couple of different bands Exodus. I think I remember Exodus and they were heavy metal

204
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And I really heavy and now they're I'd say that the music they play is

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, it's punk rock it kind of it's a little more 80s and maybe a little more rock than punk than say

206
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Green Day or blink 182 or a good Charlotte

207
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But it does have the harmonies, you know, and it's just it's good rock and roll

208
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And here's a song that they chose to be played on

209
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,500
KSFU. It's one of their favorites from their upcoming album. Released or unreleased doesn't

210
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
make any difference because we're going to crack.

211
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:26,500
We've freed them, Ontario!

212
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I can be a candy or a nasty to a wreck.

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's the end of my video.

214
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll see you guys in my next video.

215
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Bye.

216
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,500
We are the last of the people in our land

217
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:57,500
live from the Audi A8, driving on the A4 on my way to Breda from where we'll continue on to

218
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Belgium. And you're along with me for the ride. And I've been going through just a couple of podcasts.

219
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Let me see. I had one more that I had listed, I think, on my... Let me see. They have one more

220
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,500
listed on my iPod. No, it was cool, though, although not necessarily a podcast was...

221
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,500
IT Conversations brought me Steve Wozniak, almost two hours of him. And once I'm done with this

222
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,500
recording, as I said, I've got 44 minutes left on the battery. So, you know, hold on, see, there's traffic.

223
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:48,500
There's 12 traffic jams and all of them are about two kilometers. So about...

224
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,500
get rid of that. Yeah, that was really cool to hear the was and I haven't finished

225
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,500
myself to listen to the second portion but that's so nice to

226
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
receive that because I tried to listen to the Nome Dex conference live and I

227
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,500
heard some bits of it but I actually missed the was in the ex session so

228
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
it's cool that we can have that. Now let me tell you about tomorrow

229
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
before I forget, tomorrow being Friday, once again life will get in the way of

230
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,500
actual work getting done. I had agreed, I don't know if you know this

231
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,500
organization called War Child. War Child is a, they're pretty much global now I

232
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:37,500
think. It started, it actually started as a Dutch initiative and it's

233
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,500
a foundation that is mainly concerned with looking after children who are

234
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,500
victims of war and if you see any of their promotional material you realize

235
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,500
that even if there's war a hundred kilometers away from where kids

236
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
sorry, it has such a profound impact.

237
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And they do a lot of very, very good work.

238
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And a friend of mine is on the board of War Child here in the Netherlands, could also be

239
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
the European board.

240
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And she owns a restaurant.

241
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And she asked me, they're doing a Feast for Peace, which means a whole...

242
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:21,500
actors and other celebrities will actually serve dinner at her restaurant.

243
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,500
And so of course you pay like $200 for a plate and it's going to be fun.

244
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500
I actually waited on tables for about three years.

245
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I think I saw the experience. I don't think the suit fits me anymore, but I'll figure that out.

246
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Now, this restaurant is in Nike, which if you were to drive that, it's almost can't get there from where I live.

247
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,500
You have to drive, you know, Caddy Corner. It just takes twice as long as if you could drive it in a straight line.

248
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,500
And I figured that since I didn't want to do that and I had an invitation to stay overnight,

249
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
I certainly don't want to drive back at midnight.

250
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
on tables and probably having some good fun.

251
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So I'm going to sleep it in my friend's house.

252
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But I'm going to fly up.

253
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm going to take the helicopter.

254
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And I think, based on the way this is going,

255
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
it shouldn't be too much of a problem to record the source

256
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
code tomorrow as I fly from Antwerp.

257
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm going to take off from Antwerp Airport tomorrow

258
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
up to Nacetic.

259
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And I'm flying solo.

260
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So you guys will be along for the ride.

261
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I have no idea how it's going to work out.

262
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And of course, I do have to concentrate.

263
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
It is kind of important and I definitely won't have a hands-free.

264
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
You know, it's going to be like, I'm going to get in the helicopter, I'm going to start the recording

265
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,500
and you're going to witness everything from start-up to lift-off to the flight.

266
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,500
I think I have to do a couple of crossings of some control zones so you hear all that.

267
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
You'll hear out some other crap on the radio.

268
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
And we'll just talk, we'll just shoot the breeze and we'll see how it goes.

269
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
But I clearly won't have hands-free.

270
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
If we're an airplane it would be okay because then once you're up in the air, you know,

271
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
you have a hand-free and you shoot.

272
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
most of them. You can do whatever you want. You want to know what I can do.

273
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But in the helicopter you need both feet and both hands pretty much at all time.

274
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
one hand on the on the cyclic which is what you'd call the stick you know that

275
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
makes you go forward left forward back left right whatever and then the

276
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
collective which is that handle that kind of looks like a parking brake which

277
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
is on the left that actually gives you the power and everything's in unison

278
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
when you pull up the collective you know you've got to depress your left foot

279
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
a little bit and you've got to move the cyclic forward so it's all kind of a

280
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
ballet motion and there's just no room for well there's no room for error

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
first of all so I'm looking forward to that so the source codes will be a

282
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
little bit different and then of course over the weekend all of

283
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
We're pretty much guaranteed that we'll have lots of new bits to play.

284
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So look forward to that.

285
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let's see, what do I want to talk about?

286
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There were a couple of things.

287
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Hold on, let me just take a drag here.

288
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This, by the way, is not what you think it is today.

289
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm cheating. Just a little bit of tobacco.

290
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Just to remind me that I'm smoking something.

291
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So I'm being totally safe.

292
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh yeah, and also when we fly, we don't smoke either.

293
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I want to talk a little bit about the election.

294
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And on Trade Secrets, Dave Weiner and I, if you haven't heard the podcast, I suggest you check it out.

295
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Hopefully you'll subscribe.

296
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Secrets.scripting.com, or of course you can get to it from iPodder.org.

297
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:00,000
We talk a lot about President Bush, about the elections, about the state of the country, about the war in Iraq,

298
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
something that even though I blogged it, I maybe just want to talk just a little bit about Iraq, because I went there.

299
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
In February, we did, and God, I wish we had podcasting then,

300
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I did an entire week live from Camp Smity in Asamawa,

301
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,500
that's southwest of Baghdad, in Asamawa, Iraq,

302
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
where the Dutch Marines were stationed, still our station.

303
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Actually, the Marines were there, now they've changed.

304
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
the Air Force that's there now. And they have regular ground troops. It's a little confusing,

305
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
but it's just different departments.

306
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,500
uniforms and different vehicles, but otherwise it's pretty much the same deal.

307
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,500
And so, so, so, so, A, when I saw the presidential debate and they were talking about the coalition,

308
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,500
or the lack of the coalition, and sure, Bush came up with Tony Blair, you know, what do

309
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
you say to Tony Blair when, you know, there was no coalition?

310
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Well, yeah, of course there's, we know that Tony Blair and the United Kingdom were in

311
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
the coalition.

312
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
But a lot of other countries got sucked in besides just Poland.

313
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
God, our president remembered Poland.

314
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,500
We never mentioned the Netherlands.

315
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,500
We got 1,200 guys and gals there right now, two of whom have been killed in action.

316
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Never read that in the press anywhere in the US press, not that I found at least.

317
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
So, you know, we're feeling a bit of the war, granted not on the same level as the

318
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,500
states, but it's also a big issue.

319
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,500
And, you know, the Netherlands got Shanghai into it.

320
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
No one wanted our marines to go.

321
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Our marines, of course, went and we support them.

322
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
That was the whole point of the broad.

323
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
was just to support the troops, which is not a very European thing.

324
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's a very American thing, and that's why it's often frowned upon,

325
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
but we just said, fuck that.

326
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We turned everything on its head and we went out and we went to support the troops,

327
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and it turned out to be absolutely just beautiful.

328
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But anyway, the Netherlands got Shanghai'd in, and I'll tell you why.

329
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Part of it was the Joint Strike Fighter.

330
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of this,

331
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
but this is the new jet fighter that all the NATO partners have agreed

332
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
that this is the one they're going to build.

333
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
There's a lot of money involved in building of it.

334
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
A lot of money had to be paid to be a part of the program,

335
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and the way that works is then your country can bid on projects.

336
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, guess what? How many projects did the Netherlands get for...

337
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:40,500
And on top of that, the new NATO chief, Jaap de Hoop Schaeffer, who you probably heard

338
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,500
his name pronounced as, Jaap de Hoop Schaeffer, he's a Dutch guy.

339
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,500
So this was all politics and it was all lined up.

340
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,500
If the Netherlands wanted to have their spot on the global stage in NATO, if you can

341
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,500
still call that a spot on the global stage, then of course they had to participate in

342
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
the invasion in Iraq.

343
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,500
I didn't participate in the invasion, but they have been participating in the

344
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
rebuilding of Iraq, which has changed since I was there.

345
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:11,500
But when I went there, and I've never been in military service, I had no idea.

346
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
I've never been to a desert.

347
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,500
I've been to the outback.

348
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And just a couple of impressions.

349
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The first one is that it is very, very dangerous there.

350
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But it wasn't at the time necessarily dangerous

351
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
because the coalition forces were seen as an invading force.

352
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
In fact, when I was there, the people in Asimawa,

353
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
and I went to five different marine camps in the surrounding area,

354
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
including Taliil Air Base, which is the biggest camp of all in Iraq,

355
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
which is even more southern Asimawa, but that's where they've got...

356
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Well, that's a huge US Air Force base.

357
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The Dutch are there, the Italians are there.

358
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I didn't hear George mention the Italians.

359
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Pretty big country there, George, looking like a boot.

360
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You could have remembered that one, but no, you were...

361
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,500
The Japanese have 800 guys there, so granted that's nothing in comparison to the US, but

362
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,500
I saw with my own eyes how the Iraqi population was elated.

363
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,500
They were so happy, and it didn't matter what country you were from.

364
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,500
The troops, the kids were running up and down, running after the jeeps and sticking their

365
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,500
thumbs up in the air and saying, you know, we're happy you're here because they've

366
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
been doing rebuilding.

367
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
I actually saw it.

368
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
I saw the rebuilding of schools.

369
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I saw the rebuild of the water plant.

370
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,500
The refinery, which by the way, if you know anything about refineries, and I didn't

371
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
until then, building a refinery is incredibly difficult.

372
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
It's very, very expensive.

373
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,500
It can cost hundreds of millions.

374
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:11,500
But also training Iraqi police force, the ICDC, which is the Iraqi ICDC

375
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
stand for, the Iraqi Coalition.

376
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
defense initiative something like

377
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,500
And the vibe was basically good.

378
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Where it gets dangerous, where it was dangerous at the time was the transport.

379
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,500
We actually drove from Kuwait City in Kuwait all the way to Asimala.

380
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,500
That's about 350 miles, I think.

381
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:45,500
And it was just two Land Rovers, our crew, which was five guys, and then four Marines

382
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
who escorted us.

383
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,500
It's crazy because you don't know what to expect, right?

384
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,500
And you're driving away from Kuwait, and then you pass the border into Iraq.

385
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,500
And it's a six-lane highway.

386
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Granted, the overpasses and the bridges that you travel under

387
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
don't connect on either side of it, blown to bits.

388
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
But it's a six-lane highway.

389
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
It's unbelievable.

390
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Now the thing is, you have to drive in the middle because

391
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,500
transports from Kubite all the way to Baghdad come over this one road and

392
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,500
that's where all the trouble would start is hijacked if a truck just had a

393
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,500
breakdown it would have to move off to the side of the road within minutes in

394
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,500
the middle of the desert upward pop 50 60 people just you know coming closer

395
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,500
and closer and if you're anywhere near town it could be five to six hundred

396
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,500
if a truck is left alone within an hour and a half it's completely stripped of

397
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,500
cargo every mirror light steering wheel piece of rubber every usable bit and of

398
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,500
course riots happen because you know people are you know fighting over the

399
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:02,500
spoils of whatever is left and combat combat that what the troops resorted to

400
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,500
doing eventually is if a truck broke down they couldn't tow it away they

401
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
blow it up they torch it and they blow it up right on the spot so there'll be no

402
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:16,500
no problems but of course you know you've got bad bad people ever

403
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
everywhere, and you have to drive in the middle of the six lane highway because of what they

404
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
call IEDs, intentional explosive devices.

405
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Basically means that they'd stick a bomb in a dead dog by the side of the road and you

406
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
pass by and it would blow up.

407
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So at the time we were there and we went and met with people in villages

408
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I went with the commander of the the Dutch Marines without

409
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Protective gear on without flak jackets without helmets into the town

410
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Just to go to the barber shop to meet with the locals and show that we you know had all the best intentions by not wearing our

411
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
protective gear

412
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,500
And it was really, I was very, very impressed and very impressed with the work that our

413
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Marines were doing, very impressed with the central provisional authority, the CPA, which

414
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,500
is what at the time was Paul Bremmer's fund and how money was being dispersed.

415
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I witnessed it.

416
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,500
They could not put on a show for me there because we would have seen right through it.

417
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,500
And we had access to everything, could talk to anybody, anything we wanted to do, and

418
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
we were broadcasting it.

419
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
We were blogging it.

420
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
It was phenomenal.

421
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
However, it did change.

422
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,500
And it changed because there was no change, basically.

423
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
from outside of Iraq, terrorists, people who hate America, who hate Europe, who hate anyone,

424
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
maybe who's not Muslim, possibly, they're coming from all over the place. They're coming from

425
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
different countries. They're coming into Iraq, and they are one of the main causes of trouble.

426
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So it's not the Iraqi people. And I think I'm probably preaching to the choir when, you know,

427
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
that we all know this by now. But the one thing, and I guarantee you the Dutch troops are leaving

428
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
in March, they said they'd stay until March and they're getting the fuck out.

429
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
because the country is pissed off that they were sent there under false pretenses to start

430
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
off with weapons of mass destruction, brought into a coalition with all kinds of political

431
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
bullshit so that we could get our spot on the world stage with NATO and all that, and

432
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
they're tired of it.

433
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And the masses here are, what do you call it?

434
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
There's unrest?

435
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They call it unrest, yeah, unrest.

436
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
People are, you know, strikes are planned.

437
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
They're just not happy with the government at all now.

438
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And our troops will be coming back in March.

439
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And I think that the work is pretty much done.

440
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And when I say the work, and this is why I bring this up, they have rebuilt the schools,

441
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
they have rebuilt the water plant.

442
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I can't speak for the refinery, but you know, I'm not just not sure what's going on there.

443
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
They have trained local police forces.

444
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
They have trained the ICDC, which is kind of like also a security force.

445
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I think they've probably weeded out the bad elements because that was very hard.

446
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,500
you know, who's telling the truth, who's bullshitting, all of a sudden you're handing him an AK-47

447
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,500
so he could turn around and use on you.

448
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,500
And the work is done.

449
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,500
The only other thing left to do is to pick up troublemakers.

450
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,500
And now there's just trouble.

451
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,500
And there's no more bombs being...

452
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
There's no more...

453
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's how can I best say this it's over it's done with you know the the the the shit that that Saddam created particularly in that area has been

454
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
We built, taken care of, things are set up.

455
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,500
They have 10, 15, maybe 20 years to go before they can reset that.

456
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,500
But now the only thing we're doing is just protecting our own ass.

457
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,500
The U.S. servicemen and women, all they're doing is they're protecting their own ass.

458
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,500
They're not protecting U.S. assets or interests.

459
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
They're protecting their own ass, and rightly so.

460
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Because it's not U.S. interests.

461
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,500
It's George Bush's interests, Dick Cheney's interests, and Halliburton.

462
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,500
It's the Carlyle, is that it?

463
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,500
The Carlyle Investment Group.

464
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,500
That's who's interests they're protecting, and they're not being fairly told that that's what they're doing.

465
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,500
And in this country, and in most countries in Europe where I can speak the language,

466
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
or have been able to read whatever they're talking about.

467
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Everybody knows by now and fully agrees and are not being there's no media bullshit about

468
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
oh yeah but you know Iraq is responsible for 9-11.

469
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's not true.

470
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Everyone here is saying hey where where's Osama bin Laden they're on to it.

471
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,500
will be a much better place if at least George Bush is no longer president and Dick Cheney

472
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
is no longer vice president and Donald Rumsfeld

473
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,500
where he can put young lives of young men and women at risk.

474
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Easy for me to say, of course, being 40

475
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
and not being eligible for a draft,

476
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
although I do remember having to register

477
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,500
in the early 90s, I had to register for the draft

478
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,500
when the first Gulf War happened.

479
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
But this is crazy, it's just crazy.

480
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
And I haven't really been able to talk

481
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
about the experience as much, having been there,

482
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
because you really build up such a bond

483
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
and a brothership and sister ship

484
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,500
with these people, with the troops there and the Marines.

485
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
And I really got...

486
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,500
And we need to get them out. We need to get them out. Iraq is...

487
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:58,500
I think Baghdad. Baghdad is fucked. Baghdad is a big problem there.

488
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,500
There's no more records. They can't hold an election.

489
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,500
The town hall with all the... there's no registration. Everyone has to go register again.

490
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,500
It's a scam. It's a freaking scam. And as far as I'm concerned,

491
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,500
we need to get out. And the only way to definitely get out on any reasonable time scale

492
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,500
is to get George Bush out and get someone in. And I would obviously say John Kerry,

493
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,500
who is going to promise us that he's going to get our troops back within a reasonable amount of time.

494
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,500
We're going to hold them to it. Or we should just show our power and go vote

495
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,500
and kick him out as well. We have that power. Absolutely have that power.

496
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
And now with these podcasts, I think we have additional power.

497
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Now we have the power of voice. We can really talk about what our feelings are.

498
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,500
But still, I think sometimes comes over even a little bit better than...

499
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
than the written word, which of course is not to be underestimated.

500
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So anyway, I have registered to vote by proxy.

501
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It is very difficult to do that.

502
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You ever notice how they never make it easy to do that stuff?

503
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's just why I thought MTV was great.

504
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You get your license, you get your voter registration.

505
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The motor voter bill I think it was, and MTV really plugged the hell out of that.

506
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Doing this by proxy, it's like, yeah, you might be able to fax it,

507
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
but you're pretty much going to have to mail this stuff back and forth.

508
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
How election day falls almost exactly six months

509
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
From tax day

510
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's on the opposite side of the calendar

511
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I say we should have election day right after you pay your taxes and what and after you you figure out what you paid your taxes for

512
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Okay, let me get off the soapbox here. It is by now 722 is getting kind of dark. I can see that we've been at

513
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's been a pretty uneventful ride, so far.

514
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Thinking of anything else.

515
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Ooh.

516
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, there's one thing I did want

517
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
to talk about when it comes to users and developers

518
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
partying together.

519
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I've been thinking a lot about iPod or how it works.

520
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And of course, I hope you saw that iPod or 1.0 has been

521
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
released.

522
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
This is for Windows and for the Mac.

523
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It works.

524
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I just called a buddy in the States who has Windows and

525
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
someone who I know is a total user.

526
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And he installed it and got the welcome file and everything

527
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,000
worked.

528
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
But then he said, OK, but now when I want to subscribe to

529
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
something, I knew it was coming, right?

530
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
When I want to subscribe to something, why do I have to

531
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
like click on this link?

532
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,500
When it comes to mankind and doing that with technology, it's a big hassle.

533
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,500
And you can see there's proof of this, there's prior art if we just look at web blocks.

534
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,500
There's lots and lots of icons that will let you subscribe to an aggregator.

535
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,500
So there's an icon for blog lines, there's an icon for feedster, there's an icon for

536
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,500
radio user land, which is okay.

537
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,500
But when it comes to iPodder, I don't think that's the way to go.

538
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I don't think we want to have, well, this is for iPodder Java,

539
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,500
this is for iPodder X, this is for iPodder.net, this is for

540
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
iSpider or PiPodder.

541
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
We don't want to have that because we just want to have one single uniform.

542
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,500
But now this is, and I can probably just see Dave Weiner rolling his eyes right now

543
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,500
saying, no, don't go there.

544
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
You can't do it, it can't be done.

545
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,500
I just want to put a call out to the developers of the iPodders and

546
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
the users who are partying with them on this.

547
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,500
We should think about a standardized module.

548
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And we've already done so much really good work when it comes to standardizing how we're

549
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
doing things.

550
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And we all can be so proud of that in such a short time span.

551
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
But we should consider making a module and making that into iPodder so that you can

552
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
subscribe to a podcast from a website just by clicking on a logo.

553
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Now, of course, it's easy to put in.

554
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I even saw someone made a podcast button.

555
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So that art is already there.

556
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And of course, you can just link your RSS file or URL.

557
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,500
a little logo, but you're still going to have to do a copy and paste.

558
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Now the way this works with the Weblog software is, so I'll just take RadioUserLand as an example.

559
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:51,500
You basically have a little tiny web server running on your own machine.

560
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:57,500
So when you click on that link, it's actually pointing to the web server on your machine.

561
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:06,500
And then that web server receives the subscription URL and then knows to send it off to the aggregator

562
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,500
portion, so to the iPodder feeds.

563
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
It's not trivial to set that up.

564
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,500
By far it's trivial.

565
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:22,500
And even harder is to make the subscription engine the same for every iPodder.

566
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,500
I'm just throwing it out there to see what comes back.

567
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,500
But if we want to really complete the final user experience.

568
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
really really really can make this fly. We have to be able to tune into our podcast

569
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and that tuning in has got to be a little bit more simple than the copy paste. I

570
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
know that

571
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,500
You subscribe to stuff, people using aggregators do it all the time.

572
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
But I doubt that people using blog lines do it all the time.

573
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,500
I think probably a lot of people using blog lines, which is a centralized aggregator, will

574
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:04,500
only subscribe or most likely only subscribe mainly to web logs that carry the blog lines

575
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,500
subscription logo.

576
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,500
So something to think about before we get into a whole bunch of other features and functionality.

577
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
That's a glaring thing that we should at least think about.

578
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,500
that should be possible

579
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
uh...

580
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
let's try

581
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
to not have a lot

582
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
david yes i can hear david whiter screaming saying no no no no he's

583
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,500
screaming at his ipod now

584
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,500
but i think it's actually possible i want to give it a shot you know as long

585
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
as i don't break anything in the process we keep all the others

586
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
I think we'll be okay.

587
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
Um... boy.

588
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Man, I've got a dry mouth from all this talk.

589
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Um... tomorrow, as said, on the podcast.

590
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Which you may not receive until Saturday, now that I think about it.

591
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Oh no, wait a minute, my buddy will have a connection with me to pop it up.

592
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Yeah, I'll be able to do that tomorrow before I actually start doing the waiting thing.

593
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
We'll be flying together.

594
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,500
So I'm looking forward to that because it's probably going to be the first podcast ever done.

595
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Yeah, from the air.

596
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Alrighty, let me just see if I can do this, the final bit here, hold on a second.

597
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Just moving my finger across the screen.

598
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Oops, I don't want to do anything too drastic.

599
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Okay, uh... yeah, that's it everybody.

600
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Thanks for listening to the source code for October 7th.

601
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
2014

602
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
The power of your influence.

603
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
And we'll see you tomorrow.

604
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
I'll come into you from...

605
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,500
We'll see you tomorrow between...
