1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Well, hi everybody!

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Welcome to Amsterdam where the show is originating from today.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I am at what we call the bunker bringing you your daily source code.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Got a lot of stuff lined up for you today.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,500
First of all, the reason I'm in Amsterdam is because I have a meeting tonight at 8 o'clock

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
with a couple of friends.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
We've been working on a TV show that we've been testing out on the net.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,500
We've been just using Final Cut Pro and all the typical weblogger type material and tools

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
to make this television show.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
We're discussing making a pilot and we're doing that tonight.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
So it was easier for me to come up here and stay overnight and then go back tomorrow.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
And tomorrow I have an interesting meeting with a publisher here in the Netherlands.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the iPod platform and audiobooks which is there's no audiobook culture here at all

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
no one has really ever ever successfully gotten that to fly here so that's the

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
reason I'm here but so you also hear some some of the sounds of the Street of

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Amsterdam I'm in our canal house which is right overlooking the canal and so

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
there's all kinds of traffic boats and you know by the time the music dies

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
off you might be able to hear some stuff. Got CNN going on here on the

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
on the left I see testimonial on Capitol Hill about the Afghan election

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
okay so we've got all the multimedia stuff rocking and rolling and then let's see

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
on the health side not too good the news today

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
personal with the family, although the extended family, first of all, tomorrow we

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
have to put one of our dogs down, Chrissy, who is a Maltese. We've had her for

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
15 years. Life expectancy of the Maltese is usually no more than 12 or 13, yeah,

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
at the max 12 or 13 years. And in the past year she's really, yeah, she's

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
really deteriorating. Her health is deteriorating and she's now deaf and

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
blind and when she's awake she cries a lot and so it's just time. It's just

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
time. So that's sad. So I had to say goodbye to her today when I left. And

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Patricia called me. She called me earlier. One of the six black baby swans that we

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
have was either attacked or did

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but she had to fish it out of the water and it was still breathing and still alive but

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
not doing too much.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And so she'll give me a status report on that, I haven't heard anything yet.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But that's a bummer.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And quite honestly, this is the first year that we've actually had all six live to

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
this stage.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Usually, it's a bummer.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
get just eaten up when they're small, you know, either by fish in the water, believe it or

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
not, or other prey that's just roaming the premises.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, it's nature.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And nature is so hard, man, because what Patricia did is she then got the mom and the dad,

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
who we call Fred and Ginger, and she, because they walk with her and they hang out with

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
her all the time.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So she lured him over to the baby and she...

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
walk right past totally ignoring it. So that's the tough, tough way that nature is. And then finally

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
on the on the health on the health topic, my mac is sick. It really is. And I don't think it's good.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it's giving me all the signals that it's really just not feeling well.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I wanted to blog about this, but it's so difficult really to explain, you know,

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
when just little minute things are going wrong. And it all started, of course, when we started doing

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
this this audio recording and podcasting and downloading gigabytes of files or somewhere

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
something something's hosed. I'm just not sure what it is. Now I've looked around at the

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mac health forums. I've Googled this, of course. Here are the symptoms. Every once in a while,

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the machine may freeze up for just a second or two. That happens. But that doesn't seem to be

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that related, although I'm sure it is somewhere deep down. But that

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
That's not when the problems start.

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,500
But eventually after I've been using my Mac, no matter what

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I'm doing, then it seems like the Finder will become useless.

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,500
In fact, you can't launch any application sometimes, or ones

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
that are clearly on your screen.

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
You can't activate.

61
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
And then, for instance, I can't activate Safari, but I

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
will be able to log out or request a log out or request

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,500
a restart.

64
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
But then I can't actually activate the restart

65
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
window and have to wait in 120 seconds before it

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
does it automatically.

67
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
So there's something with the Finder.

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I also thought something with the Dock maybe.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
So I trashed Plist files.

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I got Cache Cleaner and deleted all the files.

71
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Even though I'm sure I deselected delete browser caches, virtual memory, swap files, everything's

72
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
gone so that's all cool.

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I ran several set permissions programs, that's not it.

74
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Now here's another one of the symptoms.

75
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Software update has been trying to install the Java 1.4.2 and I know there's been issues

76
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
with that.

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Whenever I say install, it pops up once every other day to install this update and I'll

78
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
click the install button.

79
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
It'll go gray for a couple of seconds.

80
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
It'll come back blue and then whenever I click it, it goes gray and comes blue.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
problem. And I've gone through just about everything I could find every tip on that.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Even though I can download an application and drag it into my applications folder and fire

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
it up from there, unless of course that finder problem kicks in, I can't install packages.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They just, I get all the way to the install part and then the same thing happens. So

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
there's something with some, that's why I thought it was the permissions, but that's

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
not it. And then eventually just to have the machine function even though it's

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
not, and I must say that it's running much better now. I ran cache cleaner.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's running, I mean, so much smoother and the secondary fan isn't kicking in.

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Upon some recommendations that I read I deleted some key files in the library preferences folder

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
For finder for doc for a couple other things

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
So I'm kind of out of loss here one other thing

92
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
When I I have the console log open and

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Earlier I'm not seeing it now

94
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
check

95
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I do have the jack server from the jack tools it's saying it can't connect to the default jack server

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
But that shouldn't be a problem that it's logical because I don't have the server running so

97
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,500
It does try that every every other you know a couple of minutes

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
No, it's not saying it before

99
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
It was giving me a PA a power management

100
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Error of course, I didn't capture it. Oh, is there a history to this? Maybe there is a history. Hold on

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Caesar console history quickly

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I guess not

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ah, damn, okay.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Then maybe somewhere.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And lo and behold, and I've had this happen a couple of times, I put my Mac to sleep before I drove up to Amsterdam, and then it won't wake up.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It'll wake up, and you can hear the drive cranking up, you can see your mouse, but the screen really stays black, and then you never get the login screen, it just goes back to sleep.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Try it a couple of times, and then eventually wind up having to do a hard...

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So those are the symptoms and then after you do one of those hard resets, then of course it's coming up with the famous

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
orphaned indirect node

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
warning and the

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I should have written that one down

112
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Well anyway, there's some file that is, I guess not right, it takes a long time for it to scan the disk.

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
more of the same happens. I've also done the boot in single user mode, done the

114
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Fisk the disk, all of that. So I don't know, you know, it's it just happens after

115
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
every once in a while. And of course I'm sure if I reformat everything and

116
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
reinstall the OS, I'll probably have a perfectly good machine back. But damn,

117
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
what a lot of work is invested in. How much time will it really take for me

118
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,500
to, you know, to restore all those little things I have running. So it's sad.

119
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
It's sad when your Mac gets sick. If anyone can help, please let me know.

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Alrighty, this is your daily source code where users and developers party

121
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,500
together, also known in some circles as a soliloquy. So I figured we play the

122
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
ultimate soliloquy song for today. Can't even pronounce the damn word

123
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
soliloquy.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So when it comes to being a lot is to be myself and I

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Be myself and I

126
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We must open up

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now, use your plug one style

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wear my plug one style

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Because you're the one that you are

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hit these luggages

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's the matter?

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You shouldn't have to be forthin'

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And you're fast no more

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So why don't you really come to

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's go

136
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

137
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

138
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

139
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,500
And from me myself and I

140
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,500
And from me myself and I

141
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,500
And from me myself and I

142
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,500
And from me myself and I

143
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Glory, Hallelujah, Glory, Wokla, One, Two

144
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Glory, Hallelujah, Glory, Wokla, One, Two

145
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I know this so I point at Q-Tip and he stays black as black

146
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
You're a mirror on the wall, chup

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Rima Shottuna

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Rima Shottuna

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Rima Shottuna

150
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Lady Miskir and the gang of De La Soul, me, myself and I on your daily source code for

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wednesday, the 29th of September 2004, coming to you from the city of Amsterdam.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh man, we got so much to talk about today.

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So many bits, so many clips.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let me see, what do I have next?

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In my refer log, from my weblog, I came across a link from something called The Linux

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Show.

157
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think I've heard The Linux Show before.

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Once I went to the website, which is a little bit confusing, I remembered that indeed Doc

159
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Searle's is one of the co-hosts or kind of like the Gilmore gang.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the past. It's something that I can listen to occasionally, certainly. And I saw that

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
on the lineup for the show, or maybe it was the evening before, I think it was Tuesday,

162
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so when did I catch this? Maybe I caught this this morning, I don't know. This podcasting

163
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in time shifted mode and I don't know what I said to who or when. Or who's on first

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
days. So I decided to check out the Linux show and about 46 minutes into it I was

165
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
rewarded. It's interesting because what I like listening to is how

166
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
people of all walks of life perceive iPodder and what we're doing with

167
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
podcasting. And so these are some hardcore geeks. It's a mixture. I don't know how

168
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
hardcore docksurls is when it comes to Linux. I mean I have to say I have built

169
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
a Red Hat kernel many times myself so I think that's reasonably hard.

170
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
hardcore, putting in video device drivers, etc.

171
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,500
And he comes into something really nice, which I have a follow-up to.

172
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,500
So check out this little bit from The Linux Show, and Doc Searles is going to talk about

173
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
his story of the week.

174
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah, the story is actually, as it's so often is with me about radio, I'm here in

175
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:19,500
this hotel, in this hotel, and I was just bored by NPR, and then I got bored by Howard Stern,

176
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
and I got bored by several other things.

177
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And there's a lot of interesting stuff I haven't been paying some attention to, but not enough

178
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that Adam Curry has been working on for what he and some others have been calling the iPod

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
platform in a generic way in the sense that there's a personal player that can be filled

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
with files that the user can listen to with their discretion.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And actually, I asked Kevin several weeks ago what percentage, how many more people

182
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
download The Listen Live to the Linux show.

183
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And he said quite a few more do listen to the downloads and do listen live.

184
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is a very interesting point.

185
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And this is the one thing I noticed immediately when I went to the Linux show website,

186
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
which I think is the Linux show or linuxshow.com or .NET.

187
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry, I don't remember what it was.

188
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And I'm afraid to fire up Safari at this point in the podcast.

189
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But you know...

190
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,500
you could download like M3U files to get the streaming version or you could listen to it

191
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
live and really, see there's no benefit listening to it live, although yeah, maybe I guess if

192
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
you have a call.

193
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
make some sense. But it was actually kind of hard to find the downloads, the MP3s.

194
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And once I did find them, lo and behold, I couldn't find an RSS feed of these archive shows.

195
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And I thought, wow, what an opportunity. And here they are. They're talking about just

196
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that. Yeah, well, maybe we should do that. Well, yeah. More people seem to be listening

197
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
to the download. Man, this is, you guys are so right for iPod. Just let me know.

198
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll be happy to help you out.

199
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And that's true with almost everybody who broadcast live and also archives it.

200
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There's this other show I do called the Gilmore Gang with Steve Gilmore and several

201
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
other people. And that's also archived. And once again, many more people

202
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
listen to it on their own time. And Adam's show, Adam, you might remember

203
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
his name. He was an MPV VJ, many, many.

204
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay, I just want to say thank you. Doc, thank you very much. Thank you very

205
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
much for setting that straight. I want to mention that Doc is

206
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,500
a radio guy. He knows a hell of a lot about radio, particularly in the United States.

207
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
And we're going to get into that, some of that. He's going to start talking about that

208
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
in a minute, but first he's going to say something about the work that Dave and I have been doing

209
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
and stuff.

210
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
years ago. He's quite a figure in Holland in the Netherlands where he makes his home.

211
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Like me and a lot of other people in radio, he remains a base of thinking for him as we

212
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
keep coming back to it.

213
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Exactly. And I've said this to many different people. In fact, when I met Dave Weiner and

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
saw that his, I don't even know if we called it a web logging tool at the time, well actually

215
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I met him when it was Frontier 4.2 or 4.7. I think 4.2 before it became RadioUserland.

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I said what a great name. I totally understand this. Web logging is like radio. You just

217
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
open your big blabbermouth, you throw some shit out there. Your jingles are pictures and

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
bits and stuff. That's what we call packaging. That's what it is. It's packaging.

219
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
So, you use the HTML for packaging and you have different feedback loops, you know, with

220
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,500
comments, with sending email, with trackbacks.

221
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
So this is something that radio people totally understand.

222
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
And you're also performing the act of soliloquy.

223
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,500
The first thing that he's been doing is basically his ramblings in the morning on

224
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
the net.

225
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
And the one this morning, several things kind of coincided.

226
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:37,500
One is that he's been working with Dave Weiner on using the enclosures capacity of the RSS

227
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Duplino standard to create an open source product for OS X.

228
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Now, what's funny about this is that Dave and I have been working on enclosures for RSS

229
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,500
for five years and been preaching this stuff for a long time.

230
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Now the downside is what...

231
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What Docs about to say is that we've created something for OS X and my question has been

232
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
answered about the Windows versions and by either tonight or tomorrow.

233
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,500
to the, so the Windows users when they come to iPod.org they understand immediately yes,

234
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
there is a Windows client.

235
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But at this point, Doc believes it may still only be OS X, which means Mac only, which

236
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
is not a good thing from an iPod or development standpoint.

237
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But let's continue.

238
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm called iPod or I think.

239
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
All the nouns get, I'm not looking at the computer right now and get confused if I do.

240
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But there's a, but the idea is that you, you know, you get the RSS feed, like it's

241
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
a, you subscribe to an RSS feed for this show.

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It doesn't stop in your computer just goes straight to your iPod.

243
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now conceptually, the standards are there.

244
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Any, any Linux hacker listening to this can make it happen for Linux and

245
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
use AUG or whatever, you know, I mean, that's not a, that's not a problem.

246
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's a, it's a real opportunity and that, and coincidentally in the middle of all

247
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
this, finally, Dave Weiner open sourced with the GPL, the code base to

248
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the frontier, which is the, the scripting and development system with which he

249
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
developed Manila, which is what's used to, it was my blog run time.

250
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,500
It's a really big project and it's a really...

251
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I want to salute Dave for doing that.

252
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Andy, I mean, he's been meaning to do it for some time.

253
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
But for using the GPL as well, that was a cool move.

254
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
So that was tied in with it as well.

255
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Okay, so that's interesting that Doc says that was tied in with it.

256
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
And the question is, of course, is there any such thing really as coincidence?

257
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
I don't believe in coincidence. I really don't believe in coincidence.

258
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I've had too many coincidences take place.

259
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I just can't believe in coincidence anymore.

260
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I also knew that Frontier was going open source.

261
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
I've known it for a long time.

262
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I think there was actually a point several years ago

263
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
where Dave was seriously thinking about doing this.

264
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,500
And I learned to script, if you can call it that,

265
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,500
just look at the iPod or Apple script and that's my work.

266
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
But I learned to do this. I actually did it in radio.

267
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I started looking at it a little bit when...

268
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
before radio was born and it was Frontier.

269
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And Frontier is essentially, what interested me about it

270
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
was that it was cross-platform.

271
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So anything you scripted out in this development

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
environment would work on a Mac and on a Windows machine,

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
on a PC.

274
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And at the time I was starting to get interested in P2P

275
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and sharing and also web logging, although I didn't know

276
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
what it was at the time.

277
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And although Dave Weiner was beating my head with,

278
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
you know, look this company you've got that's listed

279
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
on NASDAQ, the way you're creating things is highly

280
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
inefficient and you need to do it this way.

281
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And perhaps we had a bit of not invented here syndrome.

282
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But I think I just didn't really understand really.

283
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I just didn't understand what he was saying.

284
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I couldn't quite grasp the concept.

285
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It took me several years.

286
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But what was wonderful about this, it wasn't really

287
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
something you installed.

288
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You kind of like down.

289
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
loaded this application and you just double clicked on it and it was running and then

290
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,500
anything you did with that environment would just work.

291
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
And it also talked to the file system.

292
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It talked to Apple Script.

293
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
You could run Apple Scripts within it.

294
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:45,500
And so I was introduced to the concept of upstream folders.

295
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,500
So basically a magic folder that's checked by some thread that's running every couple

296
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
seconds or every minute.

297
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,500
So I really started to understand a bit about scripting and saw that it's just a language

298
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,500
you have to learn and what, as I continued and did more and more, I've created so many

299
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,500
radio user land hacked up things that, you know, it's one thing I really covet is my

300
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
radio dot root file.

301
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,500
I backed that up all over the place all the time because there's so many patches and

302
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
bridges and stuff that I've built in there.

303
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm afraid if I ever lose that then my life will be destroyed.

304
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
You know, there's just one ball of string.

305
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
because there's an object database in there.

306
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And that's really nice because you can access that directly.

307
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Frontier developers will know that I understand what

308
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
pta means, page table access.

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Anyway, so as I started to look more and more and as I actually got closer to doing iPod,

310
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Dave was going to do an open source release of Frontier.

311
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I was really looking at this saying, man, this would be so perfect because think about all

312
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,500
the things that are already in there that we need for iPod.

313
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,500
I think the aggregator code is maybe even a part of the open source release I have

314
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
to check.

315
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
the one that you access through Manila is put it that way because Manila of course

316
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,500
I believe will remain a commercial product from user land.

317
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
It's awesome, you know, it's at least it has all the stuff there. I use it, I like it.

318
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,500
It has all these, you know, these whacked out TCP calls you need to make an XML RPC

319
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,500
and it parses RSS and OPML and just all this all the web stuff that

320
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,500
that we use and that we develop for every single day is in there and I believe that

321
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
you know if I can

322
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,500
than any user can and and it's of course it's the way the future.

323
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Doc Searles actually has a website about this, the Deweyers.

324
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,500
But Google it, Doc Searles, I do it yourself, DIY garage.

325
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
And that's how I created iPodder.

326
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:06,500
And thank God we got a whole bunch of smart people into a group to continue this work and

327
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,500
improve upon it and come up with new ideas and have a much faster development cycle,

328
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
that's for sure.

329
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,500
But I needed something that I could get out there that wouldn't cost anything for

330
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
anyone to just try out.

331
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,500
And the frontier release just wasn't there at the time.

332
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
And to do it on radio would mean you'd have to download a copy of radio and

333
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
you have to register and

334
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
wasn't the right way to do it. So that's why I chose the Apple script. Of course, severely

335
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
limiting myself to the Mac platform while doing so. And that's been solved by Pearl

336
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and predominantly Python. I see that as... And I think isn't Python... Wasn't that invented

337
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
in Holland? Isn't the...

338
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I thought he was at least and I've looked at Python and I haven't actually developed anything in it

339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But I think I could learn that and it seems like a great language

340
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
one of the things that

341
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that I've always liked about

342
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Frontier and radio is that you know is that you could incorporate?

343
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
the not only just Apple script but also the

344
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
OS X shell so in fact in the iPod or script I believe the way I download the files is by

345
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Using a command line. I forget what did I use for that? It's it not get Earl

346
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Whatever the improvement is of

347
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Links remember links minus D that would download your file

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Actually, I use the the minus there's some other switch in there that I use curl like that's what I use curl

349
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Some other switch that checks to see if it's downloaded a partial portion of the file and will actually resume the download

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Those I think that was actually a thread on the iPod or develop developers list

351
00:27:52,500 --> 00:28:03,500
the other day. So I've been looking forward to delving into frontier. I don't know if

352
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,500
I'm going to have time to really focus on it before the end of the year because we've

353
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,500
got the move, we've got blogger con, there's all kinds of stuff happening and I have so

354
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:17,500
many fricking podcasts I have to listen to every single day and I love it by the way.

355
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
I just don't know if I'm going to have time because essentially what I've been

356
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,500
invited to do now that this is open source and you can check it out at

357
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,500
kernel.scripting.com and everyone's invited is you can actually bake some of this

358
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,500
cool stuff right into the kernel which was just apparently is supposed to be

359
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,500
megatons faster than doing it in the scripted way but of

360
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,500
course you have to program C I think. There's a couple of different and

361
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,500
everything's explained and it's just a huge huge code base and it really is I

362
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:55,500
think at least for as long as I've known him Dave Winer's life work.

363
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I don't know what he expected it to become,

364
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
but I think he's doing the right thing by putting his baby out there to the rest of the...

365
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Actually, a lot of emotional stories from people about how much they lived with this code base.

366
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,500
I think we probably had a very similar, very similar to the iPod or Dev group,

367
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,500
where people just getting along and hanging out and having a good time and creating something that was groovy and worked well.

368
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
where. And I think that this, that that community is still there. I certainly want to join

369
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
it. I want to learn how. And I was listening to Dave's morning coffee notes for, it was

370
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
actually two days ago, the 27th is when it's dated. You can check it on his web log. If

371
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
you haven't subscribed, you should subscribe to his.

372
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
with your iPodder. And he told the story about releasing this and it's a very personal, very...

373
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It points even, I think, emotional tale and what he really wants to come of this.

374
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I wanted to play a little excerpt from it. In all, it's about 30 or 40 minutes and it's really

375
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
worth listening to because it really sets you up to understand what the culture is behind this

376
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
code base. And he does talk about a couple of things that I think any developer that is

377
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
working on iPodder and even some users who may just be interested in checking out...

378
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,500
And I think that this may be something that we should look at particularly because of

379
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,500
some of the integration capabilities that it has or will have and the cross-platformity

380
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
of it.

381
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:43,500
We might want to look at this for developing the podcasting side of iPodder.

382
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
I just want to drop an mp3 file.

383
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I think I should do is create the mp3 file set the metadata you know the id3 tags and the rest should happen by itself

384
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Right now I spend so much more time doing other things getting it up there that you know

385
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There's just a lot of

386
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
time to be to be one doing that and and hey fuck it time is money, okay?

387
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So I want you to listen to a bit of Dave

388
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Talking about the frontier open source release this software just wants

389
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Two things it wants to be preserved and it wants to have a chance so

390
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It doesn't want to take anything away fact one of the projects that I've listed on great things to have would be

391
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
to have Python run inside of the frontier environment and

392
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Believe me if you look closely it makes a ton of sense

393
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Python is a wonderful language. It's very philosophically compatible with

394
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The approach the frontier takes

395
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I

396
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Think frontier goes a little further

397
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Python says that white space is significant which I think is a very good idea

398
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Frontier agrees, so much so that there are no curly braces and semicolons in the language,

399
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
although there actually are.

400
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
But don't tell anyone.

401
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
And I mean, you can enter them if you want to.

402
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
You don't have to though.

403
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,500
It will generate them for you.

404
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,500
And other languages like Perl and Java and C-Sharp and so forth, all would make sense

405
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
in this environment.

406
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
It is that, an environment.

407
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
So all are welcome.

408
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
What else?

409
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
So what other ideas are there?

410
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
A Linux port would be great.

411
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And how about baking in a BitTorrent server inside of Frontier?

412
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
That would be something I'd love to see.

413
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:45,500
In other words, let's make BitTorrent as easy, setting up a BitTorrent server as easy as we possibly can make it.

414
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
So that they'll...

415
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
See where I'm going?

416
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
There'll be lots of BitTorrent.

417
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
server. So when I want to publish something and release it under bit.torn, I shouldn't have to do

418
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
anything other than just drop something into a folder and have it immediately be recognized and

419
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:10,000
then have the proper .tor file be generated or is it .tor? I never really remember. Be generated

420
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and published and you know make it so that it's absolutely effortless to do that. Would be wonderful.

421
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Just some ideas. I'm sure there are plenty of others. In terms of forks.

422
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Okay. Before we get to this, to the cutlery, I encourage you to listen to that

423
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,500
morning coffee notes that Dave did. I heard it this morning and I was like,

424
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
wow, you know, this

425
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
emotional stuff but it's cool because it sets you up and it gets you really in the mood to

426
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
go and do something with it.

427
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I like that idea of a bit torrent being baked in.

428
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I thought actually, I don't know if it's true.

429
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, hold on a second.

430
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I had a feeling that there was some kind of P2P hooks in there already.

431
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I don't know.

432
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Definitely worth taking a look at.

433
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Pernell.scripting.com.

434
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay, I want to bob back for a second to the Linux show just briefly.

435
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Remember, Doc Searle's Radio Guy, so he has the same senses that I do about...

436
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's an industry.

437
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You grow up in the radio industry and they're just like any of the music business.

438
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There's our version of the Amit Ardagan from Atlantic Records.

439
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We've got the big program directors, the big music directors.

440
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Although that's diminishing now that everything is becoming clear channel basically.

441
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And we have that.

442
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We've got Clear Channel, we have the NAB and lots of Radio Guys.

443
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'll talk about it later.

444
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,500
And especially the morning show guys. Hey, man. I had doing as you know, what's going on in Margaret Matt?

445
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So that's kind of like the radio jargon.

446
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And Doc and I both understand that very, very well.

447
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And he's going to go into some interesting points that I think that I've not in the same

448
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
words, but I've certainly touched on in the past couple of podcasts of the Daily Source

449
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Code.

450
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And it probably pertains to your life as well.

451
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We're thinking this.

452
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I suddenly realized what it was that had happened to radio,

453
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
that I...and what this represents.

454
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I stopped listening to music radio for the most part about 20 years ago.

455
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And now I'm stopping listening to pretty much all of it, except when I'm sitting in the car and I have no choice.

456
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Well, exactly. Except when you're sitting in the car and have no choice.

457
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Actually, you do have choice when you're in the car.

458
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You can talk to someone else.

459
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You can soliloquy. You can ask for more cowbell.

460
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You can talk to someone on the phone or you could listen to the radio.

461
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And of course, in direct competition with that is podcasting.

462
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And partly it's because the net has spoiled us for looking at what we want and reading what we want and referring to whom we want.

463
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Why don't I have choices here?

464
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah, exactly. And it is, as Eric knows better than the rest of us,

465
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it's a libertarian playground. I mean, we are all at liberty to do...

466
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,500
with the fuck we please and pointed when we please and listen to what we please and on

467
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:24,500
our own time, on our own ways and much as we might criticize the iPod, it's such a ubiquitous

468
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,500
prototype in the world for the new transistor radio.

469
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
The transistor radio made rock and roll.

470
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I mean, rock and roll happened because of the transistor radio.

471
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
This is so cool.

472
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Listen to what he's saying.

473
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
This is great stuff.

474
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
I think I agree with him.

475
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
It's absolutely true.

476
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
So what is the iPod?

477
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,500
And we may have to worship this device pretty soon.

478
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,500
In most markets, the rock and roll station was not the biggest AM station.

479
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
It was often the smallest one or one of the smallest ones.

480
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,500
They were always the secondary stations in the markets.

481
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Or when they were very powerful in a weird place like XTRQ.

482
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Oh yeah.

483
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Or they had a directional panel.

484
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I used to listen in the 1960s, they used to listen to XTRQ.

485
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Detroit. Yeah okay so these guys go on for a little while about you know what

486
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
stations they remember and and how far away they were when they could actually

487
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
receive them and hey I'm getting I'm getting mail from from as far away as

488
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Australia

489
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I got an email back here for a second.

490
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Hold on, I didn't want to do that one last actually.

491
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I got an email here from Guy Dickinson and he said something funny.

492
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
He's actually been following my weblog for a while.

493
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They say, where the bloody hell is the BBC and all this?

494
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
To get the Beves radio output on my iPod, I have to stand on one leg,

495
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
stealth record real audio, ick, streams, etc.

496
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I pay a license fee and that content is quote, mine,

497
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
can't timeshift.

498
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
How long until your podcast model is adopted over there?

499
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, you know, I'm moving by the end of the year,

500
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you know, give me a couple of weeks to convince him.

501
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And he also points out another great idea for a podcast.

502
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Then he's actually pointing to, it's a commercial venture,

503
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
it's a commercial venture, a company called skinkers.com.

504
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
S-K-I-N-K-E.

505
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,500
skinkers only with 2K skinkers.

506
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,500
And he's talking about, oh this is the walk around.

507
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
That's what it was. Yeah, the...

508
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,500
So I'm trying to find, yeah, soundwalk.com.

509
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
That's what he was talking about.

510
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Audio tours of New York and they have an audio tour of Paris.

511
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,500
And wouldn't it be great to just have walking tours, go out on your city, I mean, check

512
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
this out.

513
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
But here's, you want to make some cool technology.

514
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:01,500
You integrate, oh God, I remember this one before, you integrate your iPod or your

515
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
iPod with a GPS.

516
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
And the GPS has waypoints that you download and are pre-configured.

517
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,500
And as you walk around town, just like in the Wax Museum where you stand close to an

518
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
exhibit, then all of a sudden it's going to trigger a file on your iPod.

519
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,500
You know, if you're within proximity of this bridge or this museum or this monument,

520
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
boom, it fires off and then all of a sudden you get some.

521
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
So a guide, definitely thinking about what we can do with this stuff.

522
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Mail from Ed from Pendengo.com.

523
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:39,500
And he pointed out Nicecast, which is also a Rogue Amoeba product.

524
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Rogue Amoeba are the makers of Audio Hijack Pro.

525
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,500
And I'd looked at it before and I thought it was just some quick

526
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,500
down and dirty streaming app, which is exactly what it is.

527
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Although if you look a little bit deeper,

528
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
at Audio Hijack Pro Lite and they actually it's much easier to understand how to get

529
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
your microphone voice over to work and I could record

530
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,500
players that I have with that software. There's really no difference except it

531
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,500
just focused on capturing one application sound and then you can

532
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,500
mix in anything you want you can put the filters in. So definitely check out a

533
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:33,500
nice cast. Let me see, I had a lot of things here. Who is this? I'm sorry.

534
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Where's my producer? Damn it. Okay, Brandon Fuller, yeah this is something that

535
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:47,500
pertains to Audio Hijack Pro as well as to nice cast. Brandon Fuller said, you know, I

536
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,500
got Audio Hijack Pro but it will only actually record something when an

537
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,500
application is outputting an audio signal. So for example, if you just want to

538
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,500
record your voice by using the voiceover, you know, iTunes if you're, if

539
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,500
you're hijacking iTunes as it sounds.

540
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
source has to be running in order for the channel to open up.

541
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Now I ran into the same problem and you can solve it in a number of ways.

542
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What I've done is I have this mix program called DJ1800 and I just have a track of,

543
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I took a little bit of just ambient noise, just recorded about 20 seconds of that, just

544
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
room noise, you can barely hear it.

545
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's just very, very low decibel level and I copied-paced that about 50 times into

546
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
a quick time document. Save that and so now I have this silence track and I just

547
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
have that looping in that player and it's enough bits even though inaudible to the

548
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
human ear that it keeps the channel open. That's one way to do it. Another way is to

549
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
it's to hijack an application that does stay open. A couple of them do that.

550
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
In fact it's funny the X10 SIP phone that Dave and I have been trying out.

551
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
If I dial one digit then it opens up its audio channel and it stays open for as

552
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
long as you want so I hope that was of some help.

553
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Let's see, man we're gonna run along, we're already running long today and there's a

554
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
couple things I want you to hear.

555
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,500
and I also have a bit of comedy, actually two bits of comedy.

556
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Around the net, I've been, around the web, I've been reading about John Stewart's appearance

557
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:33,500
on The No Spin Zone, that's a O'Reilly show on Fox News, and I've read transcripts, you

558
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
know, I hadn't actually seen a pointer, couldn't find a bit torrent to it either.

559
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Finally I did today, and as I watched this, I thought, you know, the transcript doesn't

560
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,500
know justice, because you don't hear the nuance and the context that these guys are

561
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,500
talking to each other, and I think the audio, listening to that, will give you a

562
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,500
lot more of the context. Of course without the, without seeing the video,

563
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,500
you're kind of missing the smirky way these guys are looking at.

564
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It was only about five or six minutes, but I'd like you to listen to this because I think

565
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
John Stewart did a great job and I think O'Reilly, I think he was left with some egg on his face

566
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
because John just hammered him at a couple of points and he was funny about it.

567
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
John Stewart for fucking president, I say.

568
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Oops, hold on a second.

569
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't think that was recording.

570
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hold on.

571
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Or actually that it wasn't outputting properly.

572
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Let me just, here we go.

573
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Gotta put that onto, what is it?

574
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

575
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
How come I only have the two channel thing?

576
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Let's see if this works.

577
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hold on, I'm gonna try it again.

578
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Really?

579
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central.

580
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And now, has a book called America,

581
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Citizens Guide to Democracy in Action.

582
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
In Action One Word.

583
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Welcome, John.

584
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
This of course, I'm sorry.

585
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He's here to promote the audio book

586
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
that we reviewed on Source Code before.

587
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Stuart to the nose, spins on everyone.

588
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
How are you, sir?

589
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Okay, you know what's really frightening?

590
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Uh-oh.

591
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You know what's really frightening?

592
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You've been reading my diary.

593
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You actually have an influence

594
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
on this presidential election.

595
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, that is, that is.

596
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If that were so, that would be frightening.

597
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It is, it's true.

598
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I mean, you got Stone Slacker's,

599
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
watching your dopey show every night.

600
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah.

601
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Okay, and they can vote.

602
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You can't stop them.

603
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
I just don't know how motivated they would be if these stones flackered.

604
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,500
Yeah, it just depends if they have to go out there.

605
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You did the research, you know the research on your program.

606
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
No, we don't.

607
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
87% are intoxicated when they watch it?

608
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh, no, see, no, I didn't realize that.

609
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah, we have that there.

610
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
We come on right after, I believe, the puppets that make crank calls.

611
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

612
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So we are, I think, the appropriate follow-up.

613
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah, and it's a great lead-in for you.

614
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I have to put your vote.

615
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You can't vote, but these dopey kids who watch it, can't?

616
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Actually can.

617
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
In Florida they can.

618
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You can't vote.

619
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
vote Republican and they haven't committed a felony and they haven't

620
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
committed a mess attack. But you do have some influence. Now how do you see that?

621
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You have influence. John Kerry bypassed me and went right over to you. You're only

622
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
four blocks away. He said, O'Reilly, I don't think so. Stewart.

623
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Again, I mean, no disrespect. The snack selection backstage, quite frankly.

624
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You know, listen to O'Reilly, how fucking jealous he is. I mean, he can't fucking

625
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
stand that this is happening. I don't want to say Guantanamo Bay, but it's a

626
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
little fair back there. It's close. We want people to be hungry when they come out. I

627
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
think that's why. We have what I like to call a snack size, three musketeers,

628
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
some snickers, some Milky Ways. If I were presidential candidate and I had to

629
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
choose, I think a place that had an energy pick me up might be the place I

630
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
would go. Do you think that Kerry does himself any good talking to you? Because I

631
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
think most of your audience can vote for him anyway. If I thought,

632
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Lackers, if I thought honestly that their strategy hinged upon his coming and

633
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
talking to me.

634
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
I would suggest that they are in some deep trouble.

635
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
I don't know, I feel like if, you know,

636
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,500
we're not, we don't have an agenda of influence.

637
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,500
We, if we have influence, it is peripheral.

638
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,500
And I don't imagine that people who watch the show

639
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
are watching it to make up their minds in terms of

640
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
who they think would best prosecute the war on terror.

641
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
I think they watch to see who would maybe

642
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
have the best jokes on the war.

643
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
No, here's what I think they would.

644
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I've been on a show a couple of times.

645
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
I mean, you obviously make fun of everybody.

646
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
You're, you're, you know, I'll make it fun of your show now.

647
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But you are a show that your target audience is younger,

648
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
left leaning, so you have to play to the choir sometimes.

649
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Well, the real estate is younger just because it's company-

650
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And it's at 11 o'clock at night.

651
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I don't know if it's left leaning.

652
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Foxworthy and all that, you consider that a red state show.

653
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You know that it's Foxworthy and Bill Angle.

654
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Okay.

656
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
There are lead-in on Monday nights and there's really no difference between.

657
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Okay, but even so, younger people tend to be a little bit more, you know.

658
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
When you say younger, you're talking nine times.

659
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
What are you talking about?

660
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, I'm talking 18 to 25.

661
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Excellent question.

662
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Excellent.

663
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
This is the shit you got to watch out for on television is people just throw

664
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
stuff out there, throw, I mean, what the fuck does he know?

665
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Did he really look at the demographics of John Stuart's show?

666
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I have some doubts.

667
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Why do you have such unicycle?

668
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Yeah, some French, we're boycotting French so I couldn't answer.

669
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
By the way, I think I couldn't agree with you more about the French thing.

670
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,500
They are such an important country and I think really deserve a boycott.

671
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:05,500
This is classic John Stuart and he's going to grill O'Reilly about, you know, hey,

672
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,500
why are we making, well listen to what he says, this is fabulous, fabulous television.

673
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
The influence they wield in the world.

674
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Well, you know, I know you don't do a variety of cheeses.

675
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
I know you have to have your breed before you go on.

676
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Honestly, I do really believe France is in any way worthy of a boycott.

677
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,500
I do.

678
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,500
I think France has really hurt the USA to be well-sealed.

679
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Really?

680
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Yes, I do.

681
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
More than Saudi Arabia.

682
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
You would advocate a boycott.

683
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
I'm not going to say more than Saudi Arabia, but I'm

684
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
we're a question for revolution they haven't been our friend okay

685
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
right on the right on the other side of the area

686
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
yet again he bypassed me so i took it personal yet when i would talk to you

687
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and i are not competitors but but well i'm a lot of our second rerun on the

688
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
factors i don't mean it in terms of we're not competitors in terms of

689
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
content your new show that we are a competition but what do you want the

690
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
audience to get out of your discussion with terry just yuck's or anything else

691
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
uh fuck you first of all i so rarely refer to it as yeah

692
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
yeah and i think you should be content okay i'm sorry about that arcane term

693
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
uh schnicks we call it schnick schnicks and giggles

694
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
thank you all right uh i am very uncomfortable

695
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
going more than a couple of minutes without a laugh

696
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
because uh the same weakness that drove me into comedy

697
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
also informs my show so that same what we call neediness

698
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
neurosis if you're not hearing the audience laugh you get a little nervous

699
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that that that would be exactly correct now because it is

700
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,500
heart, a comedy show, but it's a comedy show about things we care about. So naturally it's

701
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,500
informed by relevant issues and important information. What do you think Kerry wants to get out of

702
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,500
coming on your show? Like what he wants to get what any politician does. Access to a

703
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,500
new constituency. He wants to get what any black marketer. That's exactly right because

704
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,500
the stone slacker's this election is going to rely on the undecided. Who is more undecided?

705
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Right now they're thinking of themselves ice cream or pretzels.

706
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Don't you think that these guys want to be hip when McCain goes on with you?

707
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Bush hasn't been on with you, right?

708
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
You would have remembered that.

709
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Well, George Bush?

710
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,500
Yeah.

711
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
I don't recall the...

712
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But McCain's been on. Yes. Okay. Kerry's been on as we mentioned. Yes. I've been on. So you've had the three most powerful people beside him on

713
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That's probably right. What do you think Kerry wanted to get out of it?

714
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Hug?

715
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Just a sweet hug. I'm sure what he wants out of it is again that access to it's the same thing that Budweiser wants out of it

716
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, there you go. That's exactly right

717
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
That is the point that he was so good that he made that the same point that the same thing Budweiser wants out of it

718
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Exactly, John. Good at Dell computers. No, it's access to this market that may be untapped

719
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
An untapped potential a reserve and an Anwar if you will he wants to drill in an area that has previously been

720
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Undrilled and don't make a dirty remark about that because I see it coming. All right, you're welcome

721
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What do you think he wants out of it? I think he wants to be hip. I

722
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Do I think going on your show is a cashier and he's considered to hip or candidate this

723
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And he probably wants to get hair tips from you.

724
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Look at the hair.

725
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
All right, John's doing by his book.

726
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Here he is.

727
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And I'll see you on your show in a couple of weeks.

728
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You will see me on my show.

729
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Right back with Dan Rather.

730
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm not watching.

731
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So this O'Reilly guy, man, he looked like a total dick in that interview and rightly

732
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
so.

733
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And what the fuck does that mean?

734
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
John Kerry wants to look hip.

735
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I mean, damn, he's out there selling.

736
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's what he's doing.

737
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
He's marketing.

738
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
If he doesn't get that, then what the hell does he understand?

739
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Shit.

740
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
OK, source code continues.

741
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Want to make an announcement?

742
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
A new show?

743
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Actually, I'll let them introduce the show themselves.

744
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
This is GeekSpeak.

745
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
All right.

746
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, welcome to GeekSpeak.

747
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
This is our first show.

748
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This is Scott Alden and Dirk Solco from Solco, from Board Game

749
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Game.

750
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:38,500
Geek.com and Dirk and I got together and we wanted to do a radio show.

751
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Radio show, cool.

752
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,500
And this is...

753
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Broadcast it over the internet.

754
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:50,500
And basically what I've been kind of inspired by...

755
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Okay, right.

756
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
So it's GeekSpeak.

757
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,500
It is at BoardGameGeek.com and they're podcasting now.

758
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
It's low quality.

759
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
That's like 16...

760
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
What was that?

761
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Is that 16 kilohertz?

762
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Yeah, 16 kilohertz.

763
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,500
So it's a very low quality stream but they have guests on.

764
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,500
And if you're into gaming, I think that these guys really have it down.

765
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,500
I listened to a part of the show and I was like...

766
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
I just have no idea what they're talking about.

767
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,500
But it's a great show and they are kind of like the beavisome butt head of gaming.

768
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,500
So give them a try at BoardGameGeek.com.

769
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,500
And as our final bit for today, a comedy bit which came to me...

770
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
This is something...

771
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I'm Douglas from Tom from Australia.

772
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
He maintains a lot of my archives, my radio shows that I've done throughout the past 20

773
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
years.

774
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I don't know where I got this from, but it's some sound advice for sure.

775
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Every time you go drinking in order not to get sick, you have to remember your stomach

776
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
is just like the bouncer, right?

777
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And you're having a party.

778
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
The party's in your stomach.

779
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The stomach's the bouncer.

780
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Now, when you have a party, you invite your friends, you invite your family because

781
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
you know everyone gets along.

782
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Same thing with inviting alcohol into the stomach.

783
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Now you can mix up all the beer you want because they all know one another and they get along.

784
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Beer comes to the stomach though.

785
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Hey, how you doing stomach?

786
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Listen, man, it's just us beer here.

787
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You know, we figured we hang out and stuff.

788
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I mean, you know, you know, Core's Light and Sam Adams and Budweiser and Heineken

789
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
and Zelo.

790
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
He's crazy, man.

791
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
He's crazy.

792
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You are crazy, man.

793
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
He's stomach.

794
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,500
It's usually cool with that.

795
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Alright, come on in, but keep it down.

796
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,500
Beer goes in there to have a good time at playing darts, singing songs, but just like

797
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
any party, people find out about it.

798
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,500
And they try to, same thing with alcohol.

799
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Next thing you know, couple shots are coming along, you know, loose scotch sometimes.

800
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,500
It's stomach hurts you having a great party on there.

801
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:00,500
Get in by it, that's just a corner browser out here, see?

802
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Stomach goes what?

803
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
What is he talking about?

804
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,500
This is when they come here on your great party, when they come in by a

805
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
show in the bank.

806
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,500
All right go in there, but now whenever you mix up crowds next thing you know scotch is walking around

807
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
like

808
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
Right here your journey one

809
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
