1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey everybody!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No, like, hey everybody!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey everybody!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey everybody, indeed!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code for Tuesday, December 14, 2004, coming to you from Curricanage

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in the United Kingdom of the Great British Isle.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's your source code, let's party.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's our source code.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It is intellect.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Some are beginning the question of this.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it the power of pure intellect or something completely unrelated?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Alrighty, it is coming up on the evening hours here and once again it's been quite a day of

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
excitement here in Good Old Guildford, UK.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've had my trip to Starbucks to upload and download and transfer all kinds of

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
bits and bytes.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I've got promos and pod-said music.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And a lot to talk about for users and developers as there's lots of stuff going on in the iPod

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
world.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's about before.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I continue.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to play the entire promo that I started to show off with because it was so incredibly

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
cute.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Listen to that one more time.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey everybody!

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, like, hey everybody!

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey everybody!

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alright, anyways, my next generation podcaster, my son Zika, learning how to do the

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
ever pod at.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anyways, it's Earl from iampodcasting.com and just want to let you know the podcasts working

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
now.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, stop on by, check it out and where we talk about how to market your podcasts and how

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to make some dough with your podcasts.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're just still in a need here.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Take care and we'll talk to you later.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright, Josh, since Zika to do the intro, you get to do the outro.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's hear your best boyly-ly-ly-ly.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:10,000
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,320
Microphone that is we see does actually have a type rating on it somewhere. It says

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
That's stupid

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,280
And I spent all this money on getting the hyped up. Oh, here it is. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I have p799

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,440
It's the memory one gigabyte FCC ID

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
QDmi fp799

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,840
Battery 1.5 alkaline double a size times one a symbol in China

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
Okay, so I got this because what I liked about the specs. Well, first of all

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
It takes regular sized jacks the the Samsung yep that I was using before

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Doesn't take a regular jack. It has to have like some mini mini plug its own proprietary cable

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
This one does have regular sized three and a half

49
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,000
Whatever jacks, you know the regular headphone and lining or mic jack. Here's what I like about it

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,000
First of all, I river it's like you know, I thought it was going to be like a really big

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,800
Independent kind of vibe of heard a lot of people about about the company and that they've got some good stuff going on

52
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
And they also I guess they do some video

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,600
Versions of this this is like one of those it looks a lot like the yep actually. It's kind of

54
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,840
You know triangular and shape and and tiny can slip right into your pocket

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
the interface

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,920
Wasn't too hard to learn basically it's got a file system and you route around the file system has a very rudimentary way of setting up a playlist

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,640
Other features which very much like you know, I told you this that has to be one chip said that it's just come out that everyone's

58
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,320
Using because it has a tune and FM tune or in it which you can record from

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,000
It does what I do like it has it can switch between a microphone on the the in jack or a line

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,960
And you can set your recording all the way up to I think a hundred ninety two

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,120
Kilbitz at a 44.1 case sample and that's really what interested me in it

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
Um

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
a couple of things are a little well some strange and summer outright disappointing

64
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,240
The first is it appears to be a USB one not a USB fast

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
USB 2.0

66
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,080
Which is all actually kind of a mood point because when you plug in this

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,040
The I River the 799 into the USB port on your computer at least on my Mac and I'm pretty sure it's gonna be the same on

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,840
Windows it doesn't mount your

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,320
Device as a drive as the yep did or as you'd expect with any other kind of like storage device

70
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,640
No, in fact you have to use their manager

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,840
Wait a minute. Let me see if I can bring that up. It's called the

72
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
I River music manager

73
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,480
Boeing bad Boeing because you know, I'm not like I'm managing podcasts here not music

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
So I want to talk about that and a few other rather strange things

75
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
But first let's get out to all the the positive part of

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
Of the I River is that on the built-in microphone

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,880
I was extremely impressed how well it functioned how well it could pick up a conversation

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,520
Because it's kind of most just made a plastic it you know you have to be careful shifting your fingers around if you're kind of holding it as a mic

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
In fact you'd almost want to have an extender

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Beton that you could you like slip it into and then you know just use it as a microphone because I tried it out Sunday night with with Patricia here at

81
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
At Curry Cottage as she was cooking now she cooks almost every single night

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
I literally have to drag her away from the kitchen to say let's go eat out

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,080
She likes cooking and she enjoys it and now that we have a kitchen that I can kind of fit into and has more workspace

84
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Yes, I too I'm

85
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,720
Following along I'm the sous chef du cotage. I am learning very much and here's and we've always talked about doing a podcast

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,520
We're Patricia would actually cook so this is not it, okay?

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,800
This is us basically drinking a glass of wine and her talking about dinner and we don't drink at all

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
So even one glass of wine kind of makes us a bit tipsy

89
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,840
But this is just a precursor to what it could be and it was a handy test at the same time

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
to check out the I River

91
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,960
Wait a minute what's the model the IFP-799 MP3 recorded this is recorded 64

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Kilbitz and a 44.1k sample

93
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
As we were in the kitchen at the cottage Sunday night okay

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,760
Another test this is without the automatic gain control okay

95
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
All right

96
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,840
Today today dinner is

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,800
Pointy Cabbage pointy habit point

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,080
Well, there's a cabbage with a big point and we have sweet potatoes

99
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,320
Said like yes, which we gonna yeah, which we're gonna prepare with

100
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
butter

101
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
By the way

102
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,680
Check out the Madonna accent on Patricia there

103
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:23,680
Give the girl one glass of wine and she's the material girl butter cinnamon cinnamon sugar a little bit of nutmeg pepper and salt

104
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Dash of milk

105
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Skin hole

106
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Whatever you prefer and then you can mesh mesh it and

107
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,720
I think it's a lovely combination with my pointy cabbage. Yeah, how are you preparing your pointy cabbage?

108
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,400
Also a little bit of nutmeg a little bit of a flower and a little bit of milk and

109
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
because I really diced it really small a

110
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,480
Piece of butter just really little piece of butter and some some pepper some black pepper

111
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,040
And we have some meat today the meat is a turkey thigh coming out of the oven

112
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,200
From Saintsbury that from Saintsbury nicely. It was two for one, but I forgot to buy to get the other one

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
I saw that oh my saw

114
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,040
Buy by one get one free and you want one, but you forgot your free one and I forgot my free one

115
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
Yeah, I'm not used to that, you know

116
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,600
Now because somebody else always did the grocery shopping

117
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
But how much better is it now that you do it yourself? Well, I think we have

118
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I think I have a nicer

119
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Fantasy

120
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,240
Oh, yes, we can't put yeah, nicer combinations and I think so and we

121
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,320
I've prepared it right now and he saw that and what the important thing is you go while you are cooking

122
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
Yes, have a nice

123
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,960
Glass of symphony out white symphony though. This is why it's it's pinky

124
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,480
We call it whites in from the I get ripped off

125
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
It's a car

126
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,280
It's oh, what do you think it's official colored? Yeah, it's not official. No, it's not

127
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,840
But um, make sure you have something to drink normally we don't drink, but it's always nice on a Sunday

128
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,720
And we thought why not it's called outside have a nice glass while you pretend dinner so

129
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Enjoy

130
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Cheers

131
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Okay, so

132
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
The hell was that I was me turning it up oops, sorry about that

133
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
So in all

134
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,160
Considering that was just the built-in microphone, which sounds

135
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
Reasonably shitty. I tried one test with the automatic gain control on and it was all over the place like a

136
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,040
Big compressor, you know bringing up all the silent noises and you can set this thing

137
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,400
Basically that you can use it as a spy recorder and put it somewhere and

138
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,480
It can be voice activated or sound activated and it can record at this high quality of this quality that you just heard it can do 36 hours

139
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,640
You know, so it's it's perfect in a pinch just to carry around you know if you if you want to record something and you need to be able to

140
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,240
To get it at a good quality and know that it's gonna work. It'll be great and even better if you plug a real microphone into it

141
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,080
So but in a pinch it's it's perfect and I'll be using it some more

142
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,560
Also, you can just plug it into any any line out and you can record a really you know a decent decent sound

143
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:45,360
As an MP3 player itself, it's interesting because you know the interface you you really just looking around in this root file system in fact

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
It even says root and

145
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
So if you open up the

146
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
I river media manager

147
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
how man's this

148
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,360
lame they have it for windows and for

149
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
And for mac and tosh for OS 9 and OS 10

150
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,120
I don't want to mess with it right now. I'm opening up but basically what you have there is

151
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,600
A window and in that window it represents the same file system tree that you can kind of see in the device itself

152
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,280
And you can drag

153
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,120
Drag and drop folders and or files right in there and that's kind of cool because you know you drag it in

154
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,080
The downer as I said earlier is that it doesn't function like a USB drive

155
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,880
That's the way it should be it's just mounts a drive and drop it right in

156
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,320
So you have to go through this thing and I was like why the hell do I have to go through there particular window?

157
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
Which you know I haven't seen the API for it or any other information

158
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,160
It looks like that might be quite a barrier to entry and

159
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,200
Well even worse so because there are a couple of songs on it which were MP3s and one of them actually was really cute

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,040
It was like the I river song hold on let me just start this sucker up hold on a second

161
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Yeah, there it is

162
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Just go back

163
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,560
It's called I river

164
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,800
Catch

165
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Hold on catch the digital

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Flow foul

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Catch the digital

168
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,760
Flow

169
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,680
So I thought that'll be cool. I'll play that on on the source code very everybody

170
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,120
Everybody

171
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
So I dragged it out of that little super duper window onto my desktop and it went bloom

172
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,240
Actually, I took a screenshot of it to include

173
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Today with the hell that I put it oh man, don't tell me I lost that what happened to it

174
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Oh

175
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,280
Hold on I'll do it again. Oh, no, I can't

176
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,680
Anyway, it basically I will find that that picture weight that I trash it by accident hold on

177
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I see

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
How can that be I wouldn't have thrown that out that was too fucking good?

179
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,760
I'm bear with me folks. Let me just scan everything. It looks like it's definitely not here. Okay

180
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:12,960
Anyway, so it said cannot copy this because of digital rights management not allowed to copy like I would just want to play the song

181
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,280
And what I don't have is I don't have a wire that will connect

182
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,080
From the out well wait a minute. Do I have that? Do I have a wire that well? Oh, maybe I do hold on a second

183
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,880
What an excellent idea. We're gonna root around the

184
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,120
Hold on. I know how to do this wait let me in my bag. Oh

185
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,920
This is good. This is good. Okay, so I'm gonna rout around their digital

186
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
What am I looking for I'm looking for my

187
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
cables

188
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Oh, she just love this

189
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Okay, here it is. What's our time right now? How are we doing 14 minutes good? Okay. Yes, I do have one

190
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,320
I have a cable. So this is basically I'm gonna take this three and a half inch jack which is a part of my

191
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
second

192
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
This is a part of my

193
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Wireless mic set on plug that into the power book here into the mic in all right. This is gonna be cool

194
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
Now take the

195
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,840
headphone jack out right

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Now I just have to figure out

197
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Let's see so

198
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Let's get

199
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,400
Line in here. Oh, this is gonna be awesome. Oh, we're stealing from the man

200
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Check it out everybody

201
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay, we're gonna send it out to 16 perfect built in

202
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,280
Audio from line in oh, man. This is gonna rock if this works

203
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Okay, hold on

204
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Here it is. Let's see

205
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Okay, oh hold on of course

206
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
I

207
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Everybody rock out down

208
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
You

209
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Hey kids was that totally worth it or what

210
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
There's more on here too

211
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
So anyway, so that that totally sucked and then

212
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I thought that

213
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,120
That was actually recording an MP3 and what it does is it records in its own funky format and doesn't actually

214
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,840
Compress it into MP3 until you transfer what it will you drag and drop it out of this funky

215
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,440
I River MIDI music manager

216
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,960
Onto your desktop then it says do you want to make this an MP3? Would you like to leave it in this unrecognizable format?

217
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,040
So of course you choose MP3 so

218
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,600
Mixed feelings about this very mixed feelings like it a lot

219
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But and you know it's like

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,880
I thought that you know these guys wanted to be different and all it seems that they're doing in the

221
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,000
Differentiation game is you know different digital rights management, but I'll play with it some more

222
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,320
Again using it purely for podcasting purposes trying to figure out you know what's what's the best

223
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Stuff to use and for the past

224
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
Week of shows actually all of last week. I've been using audio hijack pro

225
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,440
I think I should tell you about my new setup

226
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,360
Ever since I got the breakout box which is the M audio two in

227
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,600
Eight channels out. I'm only really using it for the microphone inputs whenever we clean up my office here and I get the

228
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,760
Sennheiser when I find out where that is then we'll have a second, you know Mike that's plugged right in and

229
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,240
The great thing about this is I'm basically hijacking the audio interface sending it to the

230
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,040
To the headphones which I'm to the headphone jack in fact, which I'm wearing the headphones

231
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
So I can crank up the sound nice and loud

232
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,240
Haven't been able to do that because I was monitoring always monitoring off of the the Samsung yep as I was recording on to that

233
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,960
So now I have an array of effects all set up

234
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,400
Recording in AIFF and I compress to MP3 post show and I use the voice over plug in

235
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,800
to basically channel sound flower 16 where I send all of my

236
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,400
Quick-time players with MP3s anyone who knew with that just meant please write it down as we can

237
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Gotify what the fuck I just

238
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
All right

239
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
So more

240
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,360
More fun tech stuff later on right now time for some music. I'm not very coral

241
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Through Howard Reenstein and he was he was so kind now is to

242
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Actually spell out his name because I've been this but I'm really good at bordering names

243
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,760
It's Greenstein g r e n s t e i n which of course. I'm sure I've said was Howard Reenstein or

244
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
Um, and I met him through the web

245
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
I think we I think we knew each other from the MTV days and

246
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
He basically

247
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,640
Well, I'll read you this email which is a part of the production show notes for today's source code out of my favorite rock star and sister

248
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Barry corals about your release her second record

249
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,440
Our next record and would love you to premiere track on the daily source code next week

250
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,680
It's Barry's best for see record yet called confessions of an indie girl and it's officially available star

251
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,040
December 12th at www dot Barry corals dot com b a r i k o r a l

252
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,480
And the last time she was actually she toured in Europe for

253
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,360
Little promotional tour and I was doing the big radio show at the time and she came on the show and a perform live

254
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,240
Somewhere I still have that recording. I've been dying to dig it up. She's really talented

255
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Great great sound

256
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,280
Totally right. I think for for pod safe music and more than happy to

257
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,760
Present to you aspiring angel by Barry corals

258
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,440
And think that he would all be less and not stuck comedy

259
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,000
I didn't know that every night when they wicked the best to me

260
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,600
Well, I just gotta get through this world

261
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,920
I'll just gotta get through this world

262
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,000
I just gotta get through this world

263
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
I've been inspiring many times

264
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,200
When new lessons feels like getting questions I'm all flat to read

265
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,760
Keep hanging on to the old that it might all come back for me

266
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,520
Well, I just gotta get through this world

267
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,520
I just gotta get through this world

I just gotta get through this world

269
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm spying in the angel

270
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Just the only girl

271
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Not just the only girl

272
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Not just the only girl

273
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,240
The people you've got love is hidden everywhere in the darkest nights

274
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:20,720
They're lining boxes that shine for you and you can't see the light

275
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, I just gotta get through this world

276
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,400
I just gotta get through this world

277
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,720
I just gotta get through this world

278
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,360
I'm spying in the angel

279
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,280
I just gotta get through this world

280
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,840
I just gotta get through this world

281
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
I just got to get through this world

282
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,280
I just gotta get through this world

283
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
I just love hanging on to the old

284
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Not just the only girl

285
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
Not just the only

286
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:16,520
On safe and nutritious and good for you, Barry Coral, the planetary premiere on the Daily

287
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,080
Source Code, aspiring angel more information about that in the production show notes for today's

288
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Daily Source Code.

289
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,800
Today is Tuesday, December 14, 2004.

290
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,720
And briefly just today we went to look for Stables for Christina's horse or herpony, Princess

291
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,080
Arletta, who has been living back at the trainer's house, Luke's house for the past

292
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
a couple of weeks.

293
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,040
Christina was really antsy, of course she wants to see her baby.

294
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,520
So we've been looking around for Stables in the Guilford area.

295
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,480
This would be a major hint, anyone listening if you have any good ideas, something

296
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,600
close by, it'd be very nice.

297
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,680
We need like half-livery option, you know, during the week where they basically feed it so

298
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,080
it doesn't starve and then we can show up four or five times a week and ride and have fun.

299
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,480
But no, seriously, so we're shopping around, you know, it's a lot of horse-horse-suffices

300
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
here.

301
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,120
Can you tell that I'm not really a horse guy, but I really love my daughter who loves

302
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
her horse.

303
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,960
I do love her horse too, so we'll figure that out.

304
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,880
Something else that we've been dealing with in the past couple of weeks, noticed a growing

305
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,720
number of complaints about the accessibility of the daily source code MP3 files.

306
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:40,400
Now, in all basic probability, I'd say 99% certainty, this is because of the enormous

307
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,560
amount of subscribers to the show and we're seeing bits and pieces of the internet start

308
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,320
to creek and to crack.

309
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,680
And this is interesting because, well, you know, if this is happening to me now, it's

310
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,840
going to happen to other people very soon if it's not happening already.

311
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,400
And we're seeing some intermittent problems, basically what's happening is we're seeing

312
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,360
downloads of the show fail.

313
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,000
And Dave and I have been tracking this for quite a while.

314
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,240
We basically, in November, at BloggerCon, I did before BloggerCon, we bought servers,

315
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,720
as you probably remember, I was talking about that.

316
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,520
And we got one or two servers with unmetered bandwidth.

317
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,320
Now, it's a limited pipe, it's, you know, I believe it's 20 or 30 megabits.

318
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,160
But in essence, you can pump only so much through it so that the 30 megabit pipe, but

319
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,760
you can do that all day long without any penalty.

320
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,960
And we have a couple of shows running on that server.

321
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,720
The big ones, of course, would be source code, dawn and drew morning coffee notes and

322
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,280
trade secrets.

323
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,360
What we're seeing is these downloads fail and there's a whole bunch of different thoughts

324
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,920
and ideas and really after doing a test today and before this show went up, I actually

325
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,240
pinged the list that, of course, I'll point to in the production show notes, the list

326
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
that the Dave set up, the little comment list there, where people could check to see

327
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
how it was coming in from there different locations.

328
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,920
We're seeing that most browser transfers are going quite well.

329
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,720
Some of the iPodter clients, sometimes they'll break, sometimes they'll stop, then it'll

330
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,280
be, and it's really it's unreplicable.

331
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
You can't really figure out what the problem is.

332
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm pretty sure it's not going to be the iPodter clients because, you know, that's just

333
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,840
and everyone's making an HTTP call, so it's somewhere along the line, it's failing.

334
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:46,800
I don't know a lot about networking in bandwidth, this is also not Dave's area of expertise,

335
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,640
but we have gotten a number of very good comments and good information.

336
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,360
The basically says, okay, well, the problem is you're sitting on a tier three provider

337
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,920
and, you know, the bandwidth that you've purchased is basically crap or not, you know,

338
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,600
there's no service level agreement, perhaps, or, you know, there's a whole bunch of

339
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,120
different issues that have to be looked at.

340
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
That's part of the problem.

341
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,560
You know, also, we're just, we're growing, you know, this stuff is getting so big,

342
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,560
that it's going to come down to, well, a couple of different ways to solve it, eventually,

343
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,200
I think there's just not going to be any other way, but to go with, you know, 100% bit

344
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,080
torrent integration and everyone has to be able to support it and it has to work.

345
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,960
And I think I'm going to start using bit torn pretty soon because no matter how many

346
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,040
providers we get, you know, eventually, I think, when to get up to this point where it's

347
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,120
just going to start breaking because there's too many iPod or clients and people who are interested

348
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,680
in subscribe to the show, trying to get these MP3 files simultaneously, so spreading it out

349
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,680
in a P to P fashion makes a lot of sense to me.

350
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:57,200
Something that the, that the iPod of developers could do, it would certainly help me and

351
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,720
and don and drew, and I'm sure more to come as the bandwidth crunch gets worse.

352
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,680
And having developed an iPod or I know that this is something that may not, it's just

353
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,720
basically a loop that you, that you could put into the program.

354
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,720
If the download fails, it would be great if the iPod or client could not say, you know,

355
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,880
skip it or put in the cash is not there or gone or whatever, but maybe you could go back

356
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,920
in half an hour or 45 minutes and try it again or just some random time.

357
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,360
And also, I, and I saw iPod or X do this, it sets up random times of grabbing the

358
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,680
file for, you know, your iPod or goes out, not at the top of the hour, but at a random

359
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,080
time that it's set, excuse me.

360
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:47,800
So all that stuff is really going to help, and yeah, that would be the number one, the number

361
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,320
one cool thing that we could do with our iPod or clients is to have some kind of

362
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,160
resumable functionality.

363
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,760
And I think that let me see Doppler had it in there.

364
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,480
I'm looking at the comments here that, of course, are in the, in the show notes.

365
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,520
Let's see this is from Erwin from Doppler Radio.net.

366
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,120
Welcome early and flanders this day, download your lady, latest daily source code, heard

367
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
you talk about download problems with a daily source code.

368
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,840
I'm happy to tell you that Doppler 2.0, which I will release into the wild, is, supports

369
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,720
resuming downloads, also known as byte-ranging.

370
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,840
There you go, which helped me a lot to overcome the download stalling problems as you described

371
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
in your podcast.

372
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Okay, thank you very much, Erwin.

373
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,760
That would be great if we could get the other iPod or developers to do that.

374
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,160
Because this is something that's, if it's happening to me, it's, you know, and of course,

375
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,520
I'm going to work on finding new bandwidth solutions, and it seems only logical that

376
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,480
we're going to run into, you know, bandwidth providers who are going to have some great ideas.

377
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,000
But in the meantime, it would be great if we can definitely help each other by, you know,

378
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,560
working around some of the, the nuttiness of the internet, if stuff breaks, that we can go

379
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,040
back in kind of unbreak it, or at least try to still deliver on the promise.

380
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm also, hold on one second, and I just, sometimes I got to hijack the signal again,

381
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,040
because I delay set signal.

382
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,720
That's when you basically hear me talk like I'm drunk, that's when the delay sets it on

383
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
my headphones.

384
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
I got to figure out why it's doing that.

385
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
That's not right.

386
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,720
It also is going to say, um, but we had that about, oh shit, I don't know.

387
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
You know what?

388
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
You know what I need right now?

389
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,400
You know what I really need?

390
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:32,000
Put your hands on your iPod or your MP3 player at this moment, my brothers and sisters,

391
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,840
and feel more cowbell.

392
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,840
After a series of staggering defeats, Blue Oyster called assembled in the recording studio

393
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,840
in late 1976 for a session with fame producer Bruce Dickinson, luckily for us, the cameras

394
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
were rolling.

395
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,720
Alright guys, I think we're ready to lay this first track down.

396
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,360
By the way, my name is Bruce Dickinson, yes, the Bruce Dickinson, and I got to tell you

397
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,000
if fellas, you have got what appears to be a dynamite sound.

398
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Coming from your Bruce, that means a lot.

399
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,840
Yeah, I mean, you Bruce Dickinson, this is incredible.

400
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,120
I can't believe Bruce Dickson digs our sound.

401
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,920
These guys, I put my pants on just like the rest of you, one leg at a time.

402
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,720
Except once my pants are on, I make gold records.

403
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,120
Alright, here we go.

404
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,560
If you don't feel the reaper, take one roll, one, two, three, four.

405
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Wait, wait.

406
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,560
First, could you come in every second, please?

407
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,280
That camera's going to be a great track, guys.

408
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
What's the deal?

409
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,000
Are you sure that was sounding okay?

410
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,160
I'll be honest, fellas, it was sounding great, but I couldn't use the little more cowbell.

411
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:37,320
So, let's take it again, and Jean, really explore the studio space this time.

412
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
You got a Bruce?

413
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,320
Really?

414
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Yeah.

415
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Explore the space.

416
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Okay.

417
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
I like what I'm hearing.

418
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
You're all there.

419
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
One, two, three, four.

420
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Stop, Bruce, I'm sorry, could you come back in every second?

421
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Fellas.

422
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
No.

423
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,000
We just wasted two good tracks.

424
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,560
This last one was even better than the first, but it's just that I find Jean's cowbell playing

425
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
distract.

426
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
I don't know.

427
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,200
If I'm the only one I'll shut up.

428
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
No, it's pretty rough.

429
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,800
You know, I can pull it back a little if you like.

430
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Not too much, though.

431
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,200
I'm telling you, Fellas, you're going to want that cowbell.

432
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm gonna drag.

433
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
You know what?

434
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
It's fine.

435
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Let's just do the thing.

436
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Roll it.

437
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
One, two, three, four.

438
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Come on, Jean, don't do that.

439
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
No.

440
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,200
That, that, it doesn't work for me.

441
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
I gotta have more cowbell.

442
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Don't blow this forest, Jean.

443
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Could be, could be itself a scene.

444
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Can I just say one thing?

445
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
There, baby.

446
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Just say it.

447
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,200
I'm stare at here, stare at rock legend, Bruce Dickinson.

448
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
A cock and a walk, baby.

449
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
And Bruce Dickinson wants more cowbell.

450
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
We should probably give him more cowbell.

451
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Hey, baby.

452
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
And Bobby, you are right.

453
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Ambex selfish.

454
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
But the last time I checked, we don't have a whole lot of songs

455
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
that feature the cowbell.

456
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
I gotta have more cowbell, baby.

457
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm gonna be doing myself with the service.

458
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,200
And every member of this band, if I did perform the hell out of this.

459
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Guess what?

460
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I got a fever.

461
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
And the only prescription is more cowbell.

462
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Thank you, Bruce.

463
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I think if I just leave and maybe I'll come back later,

464
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
and we can lay down the cowbell on, baby.

465
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Jean, wait.

466
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Why don't you lay down that cowbell right now with us together.

467
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Do you mean that, Eric?

468
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Yes.

469
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Thanks for all of us.

470
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Thank you.

471
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Baby, before we're done here,

472
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,200
y'all be wearing gold-pitted diapers.

473
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
What does that mean?

474
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Never question Bruce Dickinson.

475
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Go.

476
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
One, two, three, four.

477
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,200
One, two, three, four.

478
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Yeah, everybody.

479
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Class, et cetera.

480
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
All right, mine.

481
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Lou, it's the call.

482
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
And of course, Christopher Walken, need more cowbell.

483
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,200
And it also, so typifies the big,

484
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,200
with Dave calls the monoculture of entertainment.

485
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
We have the producer of Walken, the legendary Bruce Dickinson,

486
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
who I only know is,

487
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden, I guess.

488
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
And needs more cowbell.

489
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Need more goddamn cowbell, otherwise it'll never be a hit, gentlemen.

490
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Need more cowbell.

491
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Love the cowbell.

492
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,200
I wrote this down with a link to a post here.

493
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Okay.

494
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,200
We were talking about the yesterday, actually, after I posted the source code,

495
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I was saying, you know, in the source code itself,

496
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I talked about the opml files and how we're going to link that together.

497
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,200
And all of a sudden it hit me, or at least the part of it hit me after,

498
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,200
you know, after we were talking about it,

499
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
and I was listening back to the show,

500
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
I kind of sample through it and listen to different bits,

501
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
listen to the sound levels.

502
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,200
And it hit me like, wouldn't it be cool?

503
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,200
So here, so let's presume that from the directory.

504
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,200
And when I say the directory, I kind of mean it like a big virtual thing.

505
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Yeah, it's the directory that's at the ipod.org site,

506
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
if you go to podcast directory or podcast directory.

507
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
You'll see the directory and I filled up a couple more.

508
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,200
I have a backlog about 150 new podcasts that have to go in,

509
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
just from this past week and a half alone.

510
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
So working on that.

511
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
And if it takes too long, ping me again,

512
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
let me know there is a suggestion link, please.

513
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
But there's lots of stuff still flowing in there

514
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,200
through all of the multiple nodes that I'm not maintaining at all.

515
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,200
But it's also the same directory that you see in the ipod or x ipod or client,

516
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,200
in the ipod or 11 client, in jpod or in most of the ipodters,

517
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,200
because it's a format that programmers, developers can use,

518
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
and kind of, you know, it's a consistent format,

519
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
so they can pull stuff in and use that,

520
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
and it makes it easy for you to subscribe.

521
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
They can glean new data from that.

522
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,200
The ipod or x top picks and most subscribe to databases,

523
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,200
a combination of their information and our data.

524
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
So, you know, we're trying to share as much of this as possible.

525
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,200
And what would be cool, of course, if you have your show nodes,

526
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
as a part of that directory.

527
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,200
So that's one part, which I'm trying to figure out.

528
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,200
So basically, you should have an attachment.

529
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
If you're in the directory, and again,

530
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
it could be an HTML version of that directory.

531
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
In an ipod or on your mp3 player itself,

532
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
there you should be able to drop down into the next level,

533
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
which is basically my production show nodes.

534
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
And here's the cool thing.

535
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,200
So let's say, like yesterday, I forgot half of the things

536
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
that I was supposed to, you know, post along there,

537
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,200
and links, and other mp3s to link to,

538
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
wouldn't it be cool if all you did,

539
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,200
if you saw something in my outline,

540
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
basically my production show nodes and said,

541
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
oh, I have information for Adam on that.

542
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
And you sent me a link to an opml file itself.

543
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I could copy paste that right in,

544
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
and would expand the information that I don't have,

545
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
so you can contribute to it.

546
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
So we have this big metadata thing

547
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
that we're, you know, basically it's connecting

548
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
a tree to each other.

549
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,200
It's a lot like weblogs kind of tilted on its side, I guess.

550
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I know if that makes any sense, but I got pretty excited

551
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,200
by the idea that you could add just like you're adding

552
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
a directory with an opml file,

553
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,200
you can add information to my podcast show nodes,

554
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
which will basically show up anywhere.

555
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
They'll show up in the directory,

556
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
in the HTML version of the iPod or directory,

557
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,200
but they can flow out to anywhere that the directory is being used.

558
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
And you can kind of walk along this directory

559
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
and do all kinds of cool things where you can look for new stuff.

560
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
You could search it.

561
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,200
It's really wonderful the way I understand it,

562
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
which is still quite minimal.

563
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,200
And then I just want to leave you with a couple of things.

564
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Well, first let me hit you with this one,

565
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
because this is another great of

566
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,200
another piece of great work from our daily source code listeners,

567
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
as we almost wind down the show for today.

568
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Hey, they're Adam.

569
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
It's fun time Ben over a tracks up the tree.

570
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Just sending you this audio comment to tell you

571
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
that I'm going to be at the Bitty's Holiday Party.

572
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
This Tuesday, December 14th,

573
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
at the living room.

574
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
You mentioned it on your show,

575
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
and I said, hey, I should be there

576
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
being that I'm a Manhattan resident,

577
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
or at least I work in Manhattan.

578
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Hi, Adam.

579
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
It's Dan, fun time day in,

580
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,200
from fun time Ben's tracks up the tree.

581
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Podcast.

582
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I just want you know,

583
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
I've been sitting in the other room,

584
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,200
and Ben has been in here recording over and over

585
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
and over again,

586
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
his audio comment that he wants to leave for you.

587
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
He wants to get it just right.

588
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
But it's taking him a while.

589
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
So this is what I thought I'd do.

590
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
I just want to come in here and let you know

591
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
that fun time Ben would love to invite you

592
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
to join him for a,

593
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
the Sylvie's Bitty's show at 11 o'clock

594
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
in the living room at New York City.

595
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
I'm at those street.

596
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I think it's 145.

597
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Let me say I've heard about 700 times

598
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
that I think it's 145,

599
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
let those street.

600
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Sorry, 154,

601
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
let those street.

602
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,200
And he would love to meet you

603
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,200
if you'd like to come down and see the show.

604
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
And he's going to be wearing,

605
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
he's always in Britain.

606
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
He's not coming to the show.

607
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Then why are we leaving this audio?

608
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm inviting the audience.

609
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Oh, sorry.

610
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Adam.

611
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
I'm sorry.

612
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
We're inviting the audience.

613
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
I'm sorry.

614
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
I didn't hear that part from the other room.

615
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
700 times.

616
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
But he's going to be wearing a yellow shirt

617
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,200
with unicorns making love on it.

618
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
And that's how you'll know it's him.

619
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Yellow T-shirt, right,

620
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
with two unicorns making love.

621
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,200
So dear listeners and Adam,

622
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
thank you so much for your time,

623
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
your patience,

624
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
and we hope to see you at the show.

625
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
All right.

626
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Take good care.

627
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Bye-bye.

628
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Don't say I can't go with other boys.

629
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,200
And don't tell me what to do.

630
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Don't tell me what to say.

631
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Please, when I go with you,

632
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Don't we be on this planet?

633
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,200
You don't don't need me.

634
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Don't try to change me in your grave.

635
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Get out on me.

636
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Don't time me down because I'll never stay.

637
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Bye-bye.

638
00:43:48,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Don't try to change me in any way.

639
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Don't tell me down because I'll never stay.

640
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,200
I don't tell you what to say.

641
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Don't tell me what to do.

642
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Just let me be myself.

643
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,200
That's all that I ask of you because I'm young.

644
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Yet I'll love me.

645
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm free.

646
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,200
And I need to be free.

647
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,200
To live my life the way that I want to say.

648
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,200
And do whatever I please.

649
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,200
You don't own me.

650
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
You never have.

651
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
You never will.

652
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,200
You don't own me.

653
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,200
You don't own me.

654
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:10,200
You don't own me.

655
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:17,200
You don't own me.

656
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
Check it out.

657
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Be these backmasking.

658
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Oh, that's for me, everybody.

659
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,200
Remember I was telling Analy.

660
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,200
We'll interview you for a while that the biddies did a backmasking song.

661
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,200
Let's play that backwards and see what they say.

662
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Here it comes.

663
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
Can I do that?

664
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Yeah, here we go.

665
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Play backwards.

666
00:45:52,200 --> 00:46:07,200
That was kind of disappointing.

667
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
What the hell was that?

668
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
Good night.

669
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,200
Good night.

670
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
That's what they're saying.

671
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,200
Good night.

672
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,200
Backwards.

673
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,200
Tonight at the living room in Manhattan.

674
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,200
It's the most serious bitties make sure you catch the show.

675
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
And that's it for the source code for today.

676
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
You're walks over.

677
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,200
A little bit long, but you deserve the long walk.

678
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,200
I just want to leave you with a thought that Ron Bloom.

679
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Dave and I have been talking with considering our new venture and podcasting,

680
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,200
where we see each other at the beginning of the new year.

681
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
You know, the iPod really made it hip to download music.

682
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,200
But it's the podcast that you're determined just how hip you really are.

683
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Depending on what you have on your iPod.

684
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Or comfortable and be three players.

685
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,200
With digital rights, music player management crafts.

686
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
All right, everybody.

687
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Tomorrow I will be back.

688
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,200
We've got Clark Boyd from Boyd.

689
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Boyd from WGBH coming into town into Lovely Gillford.

690
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Doing a piece about me and my lack of bandwidth.

691
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Oh, British telecom.

692
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,200
You're going to love this because it's a co-production with the BBC.

693
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Oh yeah.

694
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,200

695
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,200
Thank you.

696
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Thank you.

697
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
