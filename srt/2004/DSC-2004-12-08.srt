1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Before we get started, let me remind you of the following results or events predicted

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
on these things.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,680
The name of the material is from actual results.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,400
The factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from expectations include

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,960
lack of growth, intense competition in our interest rate, integration failures, changes

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,640
in government regulation, operational failures, or looking at things like that.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,680
All right, some of the volumes of today should not be applied upon as representing

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,240
our internet at the beginning of the 20th of the 20th, while we make a light update for

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,880
what we say is that something's a future we need to not to do it, so even if we're not

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,880
interested in it.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:51,760
A casting, all's like Adam Curry, howdy everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code for Wednesday,

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,160
December 8, 2004, coming to you from Curry College.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:03,040
I'm Adam Curry, it is quarter past 11 in the evening, big day today, went to London, took

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,040
a train, it's been a couple of years.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,440
I don't know, man, I got to talk about these English trains.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,080
I only hear English people complain about the trains.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,280
I thought it was a pretty fucking great experience.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
Seriously, I had a really nice ass train.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm not a train guy, maybe I've just been missing out on trains.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Good matters, is your Daily Source Code, will we try to bring you 40 minutes of 40 minutes of

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,280
well-party?

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,720
40 minutes of users and developers partying together, or maybe there are no secrets, only

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,000
information you don't yet have.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,120
And while we're on the power of pure intellect, let's start off with an audio comment that

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,440
is influential for the entire show.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,760
Hello Adam and have everybody.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,480
This is Chris Penard from Streetport, Louisiana, and you're listening to the Daily Source Code

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
with Adam Curry.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,160
Adam, I wanted to tell you I enjoy the non-reverbs sound of your cottage.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,080
I hope you get broadband soon and best wishes from the States.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,280
You've inspired me to create a podcast on my own.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Now only have to think of a subject.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
Subject enough right there.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:27,400
Okay, so after yesterday's source code where I basically asked everybody, no, I'm sorry,

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:38,080
I asked everybody, you know, what you thought about the reverb, I'd say 75% of all comments

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
were predominantly negative.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,520
In other words, get rid of the goddamn reverb.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
We were just getting used to the sound of the cottage.

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,080
So the reverb is off, you can still hear a little bit of the room because I don't have

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,360
anything up on the wall yet.

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,560
You've got my gold records.

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,360
Gold records on the wall?

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,960
My picture of me and many celebrities.

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,880
So actually, I think that if I'm lucky this weekend, it's finally time for my office.

46
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,160
Then we've done just about everything else in the house and then my office is last.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,840
And the reason it's last because I have the most shit that has to be sorted through.

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,520
So anyway, back to the reverbs, the reverb is basically off.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,960
However, I have added some more cowbell.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,800
I think that makes the show much better.

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't you?

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,920
Can never have too much cowbell, you know, basically.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,760
So anyway, I had an appointment with my senior private banker, her name is Kherty.

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
She works for Mace Pearson.

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,000
She's been our banker for, that's enough fucking cowbell.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,360
She's been our banker for, should I know, five years, I guess, and she really takes care

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,160
of a whole bunch of shit.

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,560
And I have a complicated life, or I'm trying to get away from her very complicated life

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,120
with all kinds of companies and structures and crap in the Netherlands and Belgium.

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,440
And here, I just want to have a simple, and I have it, a simple bank account, an internet

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,600
bank account that I can look at, I can pay my bills, I've got a direct debit card, you know,

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,040
we've got everything is online within my world, within my universe.

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,200
And all the other shit is basically being sorted out.

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,280
But anyway, so Kherty is, besides being beautiful, is an excellent banker.

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,480
And it's always fun to, she came over from Amsterdam for some meetings and so she said,

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
you know, why don't we hook up for lunch and I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll meet you in the city.

67
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
No problem.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,520
You know, having never been to the city from, in fact, we've been here for two weeks.

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I haven't ventured in the London.

70
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,400
I've just been here sitting in the, at the cottage in in Guilford, having a good old

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
time exploring Starbucks, which I still visit every single day.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,200
I haven't done a podcast from there because it's just the vibe, it's kind of worked out

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,040
where I've been doing stuff in the cottage, then uploading from Starbucks.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,720
And this will actually have to upload during the night anyway.

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,000
So I mean, my big mouth said, okay, lunch, I'll meet you at the, was it the Great Eastern hotel,

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,360
which is Liverpool Street Station at noon.

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,480
And I figured, well, you know, I'll have a, a car picking me up and take me to the station at 1030.

78
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,760
And yeah, radio cars here are pretty normal.

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Just cost, you know, like a pound at a half or something and take me from, from the, from the cottage

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
to the station because it's not all that far.

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,240
And it was one of those perfect days, you know, when you walk into the station,

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,320
you walk up to the window, you say, I got to go, you know, to Waterloo Station.

83
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,160
I was thinking I'd take a cab from Waterloo Station to Liverpool Street Station.

84
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,600
I mean, you can take the, the tube, which is the, the subway.

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
I really wanted to go above ground, so I could, you know, get a little vibe of the city.

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,200
And, you know, walk up to the window, got my, got my ticket.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,320
I chose for a first class ticket because I want to see what that was like first, of course.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440
Being a stop that I am, the elite fucking stop that I am, and it was really nice.

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,920
I mean, it was kind of like a luxury airliner, you know, what used to be economy class,

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,520
and I'm talking about 25 years ago, only now the seats, you know, still go back further than those days.

91
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,520
You have your own little power supply, so you have 220 volts there for your laptop and door for your cell phone.

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,800
And it's really nice and quiet. And what I noticed was,

93
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
the suspension of the train is unfucking believable. I don't know if it's just the first class train.

94
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,160
Maybe the first class car has, has extra suspension, but I mean, it was like riding on air.

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
It was just nothing at all what I remembered about a train ride. And it was only like 35 minutes.

96
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm at Waterloo Station, hop in the cab, 12 minutes later I'm there, door to door,

97
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,560
less than an hour. Unfucking real. And I thought, you know, I was in for at least an hour and a half

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,000
ordeal, but the train is almost nonstop. And on the way back, almost exactly the same thing,

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,760
you know, after a great lunch and a little bit of war driving in the cab, I picked up.

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,440
I must have picked up 15 different, uh, open Wi-Fi signals on the way back, um,

101
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,840
actually trying to connect, uh, but we weren't sitting in traffic long enough to, uh,

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,040
to actually, you know, have any luck of, uh, of, of down or uploading anything on some open Wi-Fi.

103
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,400
There were a couple of open Wi-Fi's according to, uh, I stumble or which I use.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
Um, and again, on the way back, it was, I was backed by, uh, by four o'clock. It was awesome, you know,

105
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,800
off the Starbucks on the way home, uh, sucked down some, uh, podcasts, the Gilmore gang, specifically,

106
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
which I haven't listened to yet. And also it was great on the train. I had a commute, you know,

107
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,320
after a long time, and there I was, um, chuckley, about on and droop. Uh, with, you know,

108
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,880
the suits around me looking going like, what the, what's the sad weird guy with those weird

109
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,480
shoes and, and he's kind of weird hair. I got my eggs. If you don't know what they are,

110
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,600
eggs, they're basically Australian, ugly ass Australian boots, which are kind of furry and they're

111
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,760
made from, uh, sheep skin, but the sheep was killed humanly or some crap marketing story like that.

112
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,120
Which, of course, is probably completely true, um, but, yeah, nonetheless. So anyway,

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,560
had a great day in London. Uh, really, uh, happy about the, the connections. I had no idea what's

114
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,440
going to be, um, yeah, really so incredibly easy to get back and forth. In fact, if I had one

115
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,840
Christina's in school, Patricia and I could literally just decide to say, hey, let's go have lunch in

116
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
the city and we could, you know, hop off, drive down to the station and go. It would be awesome.

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,920
Oh, and Patricia had her first drive today. I mean, I've been doing all the driving since you,

118
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,320
you know, we have to drive on the left hand side and we have a right hand drive car, which means

119
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
you sit on the left hand side. So it's still a bit confusing. And, um, so the other day I came home

120
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,680
around 530 from Starbucks and it was dark and I said, come on, let's go. We're going to go to

121
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,880
Sainsbury's going to go to the, and which is, that's a good, uh, three, four, about four, five

122
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,920
kilometers, lots of roundabouts that you have to go around. Um, and producer to great, you know,

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,880
it was, uh, yeah, especially for the first time and in the dark, which I specifically made or do.

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,640
I, I noticed that I picked up a couple of instructional, um, habits from, uh, Wing Commander

125
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,080
William, my, um, helicopter instructor and all my, I should, my flight instructor period. I got

126
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,680
a call, I'm missing. It's like my wing, wingman, you know, my flying buddy and miss those guys,

127
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
him and Nick the stick. I got to catch up with him soon. I got to catch up with him. I got to get

128
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
flying and hold on a sec. Do you want to go out, Chess? I'm going to go out, girl. Okay, hold on. I'll

129
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
tell you what, why don't you listen to this promo. I'm going to let the dog out of the, uh, out of my

130
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,960
office here. Uh, uh, uh, uh, it's almost like the old days, isn't it?

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,400
Hitting you right between the years with the message of hope, love and good news. This is light spring.

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,400
And I'm Steve Webb, you're host. Here at Life Spring, we want to tell you about the one who loves

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,960
you unconditionally and who gave his life for you, Jesus Christ. Here you'll find music,

134
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:13,920
conversation, and reasons to believe. Our website is calpm1.org slash podcast.htm.

135
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
Hey Adam, thanks for this brand new avenue communication. We all call podcasting and thanks

136
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
everybody for listening. I'm out of here.

137
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Thanks everybody. The Lord says everybody give me a bowing. Oh, man, perfect. I'm telling you,

138
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,680
I love religious podcasts. There's broadcasters of all sorts. I, I get a kick out of it.

139
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,520
And sometimes I actually get a real positive boost. You know, I love people who are just

140
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,600
positive and up and got energy. It works. It really does work. And we just said again,

141
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,120
everybody, can you give me a bowing? Hold on. He went, buddy, for listening. I'm out of here.

142
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,200
Excellent. Speaking of everybody, being out of here, big news here in the UK about the BBC.

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,720
3000 people got fired or displaced before Christmas and expected another thousand after Christmas.

144
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,400
As, you know, this is like, the BBC is public broadcasting and you pay a license. And actually,

145
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:31,200
just, this is whack. You go to tvlicensing.co.uk. And maybe it's even tvlicensing.com. And there you

146
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,480
register whether you have a black and white television, which costs I think, you know, 65 pounds.

147
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,640
Or if you have at least a color television, you can have multiple sets, but you have to pay for the

148
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,520
first one. And that's like a hundred and I think a hundred and twenty-one pounds. And if you don't,

149
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,000
you can get fined up to a thousand pounds, which is, well, these days, almost $2,000, like $1,900.

150
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,720
If you don't have your license. And I think maybe the, like, the mailman checks you or some shit like

151
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
that. And as was in the train on the way to London, there were huge posters of tvlicensing.com.

152
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,600
We said, we have a database. And we know every single home that doesn't have a TV license.

153
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,960
Just thought we'd let you know. It's like, fuck that shit. I got my TV license immediately.

154
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,520
But there's so anyway, so you pay for it, you know. And then took the people have a right to say,

155
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,040
hey, what the fuck? We want, you know, we want value from money. And with over 27,000 employees

156
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
at the BBC, there was a general feeling that, hey, you know, there's a lot of people here who

157
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,720
think they got a job for life. We got to keep them on their toes and keep it competitive.

158
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,400
And there's a lot to be said for that. There certainly is. And you know, we witnessed how the BBC

159
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,760
worked, and although extremely professional, you know, even I was amazed at the, the amount of money

160
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,360
that was basically being spent. And not to attract anything from the BBC, because I'd love the

161
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,560
programs they made. But there's a lot of inefficiencies. Even when they needed me to be on BBC

162
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,280
World, they called me at 9 o'clock 9 a.m. And I said, you know, can you be here at noon to be on the

163
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,320
on the BBC World Service? And I sent a cab from a town 10 miles away, you know, it's like,

164
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
because they had an account with them, which is totally ridiculous where they could have called

165
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
a cab. Shit, they could have re-enversed me, you know. There's so many different ways they could have

166
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,800
done that. And the, of course, the cab didn't wait. They had another one come from a different company.

167
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:29,200
It was a, it was whack. It was totally whack. Anyway, so this has been going on. And I think most

168
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,720
public broadcasts are being paid out of community funds are under a lot of pressure these days

169
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,040
for this very same reason. And a lot of the pressure, of course, comes from the commercial

170
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,480
broadcasters. What's really happening is everyone's eating each other up, you know.

171
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,400
They're all just fucking eating each other up. And we have, what I think is great about podcasting

172
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,840
is, and I was talking to the, uh, to charity and, uh, another, um, someone who works for, you know,

173
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,960
the Anglo-Saxon into a trust division. It's great, man. Women bankers, they freak me out. I love it.

174
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:08,160
They're so fucking smart. Um, we were talking about, uh, uh, I was thinking about women for a second

175
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,840
then I lost my, my train of thought. Oh, shit. Oh, I don't remember. Uh, oh, yeah, about, uh,

176
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:23,040
about podcasting. Um, you know, that we basically don't have to deal with 24 hours in a day.

177
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,560
You know, we have to deal with how many minutes the podcast listener has to consume in a day,

178
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,040
which is why I'm always advocating short podcast, right? Um, so because we can broadcast 5,000

179
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,920
hours a day if we want of a simultaneous audio programing because it's completely three

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,360
dimensional. You can listen to it whenever you want, wherever you want, however you want, um,

181
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
and you can be behind a, you could, you could catch up. You could list skip bits. You can do all of that.

182
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,080
So we basically, as podcasts, there's have to figure out how to grab people's attention and keep it,

183
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,920
which probably means they should move on from this conversation. But I will say that our next or next

184
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,320
or next or neighbors down the way. Um, I think her, she, uh, she's a school teacher. She brought her

185
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,360
daughter over to meet Christina, uh, both the same age. Her husband works for BBC interactive.

186
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,720
And, uh, I think they might have to move to Manchester. It sucks because the whole interactive

187
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,200
division is being moved. Uh, they fact thousands of employees are being moved to Manchester

188
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,600
because, um, the BBC also feels. And this is a big thing that, uh, that the, the general, uh,

189
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,640
listening and viewing audience feels is that it's too London based. It's too based around

190
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,480
what's going on at London and not about basically the heart land. So that's why a lot of the, uh,

191
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,680
programming staff, including interactive is going to Manchester. And I'm sure there's some financial

192
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,720
reasons for that as well. And another big piece of news today is that there also be, um,

193
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
and haven't confirmed this. I heard this from the cab driver that there were several, uh,

194
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,120
I don't, I think he's a thousand, uh, job cuts at, uh, uh, Colgate Palm Olive headquarters,

195
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,120
ladies and gentlemen of, uh, Colgate Palm Olive is in Gilford in the United Kingdom,

196
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,600
which means there's going to be thousands of people, uh, being kicked out. Some of them, of course,

197
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,000
must be some kind of at least mid-level executives, which means some ports are likely to free up

198
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,440
at the Gilford Exchange, making DSL capable and probable. And BT, don't call me. Okay. I got

199
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,880
my boys at EZNet on the case. We're going to use their gear at the Gilford Exchange. And you can

200
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
go out and solicit more people. You could have had a real good customer on your hands.

201
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,440
That's a, uh, that, uh, that, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

202
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,960
I haven't actually, listen to this next, uh, audio comment that came in. It's from Lee Wilkins and Jenny Patton,

Thank you very much. All righty I say mission accomplished everybody good job.

221
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,640
Now imagine what we could do if we really fucking got together and really pulled our resources

222
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,360
for something really big. It could happen you know I want to think about that and I'm sure there's

223
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,480
lots of people out there who see the power now I mean we have just proven once again that you can

224
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,600
create revenue and cash flow in in podcasting and man it was quick and you know it was realistic

225
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,280
and we set a goal and we and I feel good about it you know and we could do the same for like

226
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,200
people dying all over the world. Oh my god I'm about to break out into we are the world I should

227
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,760
stop immediately. Thank you very much Lee and Jenny for sending in that audio comment.

228
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,240
A comment on the weblog from let me see this was from Michael Martelli. Michael says hey Adam

229
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,640
love the show rather new to podcasting got into him about three weeks ago while listening to

230
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,560
and gadgets like that so of course I had to start listening to the god father's cast. Uh huh

231
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,840
the pod father you mean. Uh actually don't list the podcast on MP3 player actually downloaded

232
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,440
it to my computer at work. Listen while I write software. I'm very excited to be finally

233
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
getting an iPod for Christmas so still probably listen by my computer. Oddly enough here comes

234
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,560
I actually work at your old place of employment good old MTV networks software developer in the

235
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,160
time square office 1515 Broadway and you show really helps that they go by special on five o'clock.

236
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,120
Shocked listen to the days cast you mentioned my hometown of Wayne New Jersey. I did not know

237
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,840
audible was located there neat thing to hear. You know there's all isn't it there's a isn't there a

238
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,320
great roller rink in Wayne New Jersey. Maybe that's one town over from Wayne and I think the

239
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,720
willabric mall is in Wayne New Jersey and when I think about 1515 Broadway actually was at 1515

240
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,240
was the main office we also at one point had 1775 Broadway that actually part of that burned down

241
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,200
um the some god I should ask Kenster J he should he'll probably do that on the next Ken and

242
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,920
Squip show um and it was like someone's fucking extension it was Dave Kendall's god damn extension

243
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,920
core that burned down a whole floor of the MTV offices remember Dave Kendall he did 120 minutes

244
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,800
and we always used to tease him we said in the day where that fucking dead cat on his hat which

245
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,360
was very mean to say of course some of the hair god should have actually punished me for that but

246
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
they've been pretty pretty nice to me so anyway cool to hear that you're haunted and I wondered if you

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,200
work for MTV if MTV's I guess it's still the biocomb building 1515 Broadway which of course

248
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,040
we're also their live studios are all right well thanks for uh checkin in um and there was also

249
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:29,040
I don't know if you saw this this new story um actually it finally got sent to me uh by email uh Gary

250
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:37,440
why is who um we're scary from he's the IBV Greece transmitting station the station manager

251
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,120
the hell is in Greece okay uh is that the same I guess so uh I Adam enjoy the source code yeah

252
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,360
Boeing blah blah good luck with your uh with your van with sure Denver Post reports that the

253
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,840
ours people spend listening to radio are in steep decline as younger audiences switch to iPods

254
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,360
CDs mix at home and subscription satellite signals newspaper reports several local stations

255
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,160
are taking steps to address this by cutting ads per hour jumping back into internet streaming

256
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,520
no no no no no no an emphasizing live local shows to restore the companionship factor

257
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,160
in commercial radio thank you this is exactly what is going on with podcasting and of course the

258
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,480
BBC were you know they're talking about the value of what they're doing as well and I heard

259
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,440
even though it was a pompous ass today uh who's on radio two or whatever it was uh and it was

260
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,840
course radio BBC radio London whatever it was a call-in show and he was saying radio is also about

261
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,760
the relationship between the listener and the person the presenter on the show and I think that

262
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,120
the big companies like clear channel who own most of the radio stations have kind of overlooked that

263
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,080
fact that you can't you know it's an art form it may be the lowest rung of the show is

264
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,960
ladder to be in radio but that's okay you know it is an art form and uh and you can't just

265
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,840
it's like you know disco eventually was doomed to fail for the same reason you can't automate

266
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,640
music you know which is what the big excitement of disco was it was hey no more musicians you know

267
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,880
fuck that shit we don't need those motherfuckers anymore well guess what you know it doesn't work

268
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:24,640
that way you do need musicians um so uh and then he also points to a actually included a

269
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:35,120
scan of an article from what was that uh radio world um and he yeah it's very cool sent me a

270
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,200
PDF which of course I haven't attached to the production show notes everything else is an

271
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,000
production show notes um that talks about podcasting um as it relates to radio broadcasting and that's

272
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,560
it's an interesting it's a good read I'll see if we can get an online version he couldn't find one

273
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,720
oh here it is Gary says he's writing from northern Greece where he manages a large short-way radio

274
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,000
station for the for the man for the government I've moved internationally many times so I could relate

275
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,600
to your comments on the transition from castle to cottage yeah right on okay oh by the way it's

276
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,440
has my girlfriend is joining me here in Greece this weekend coming from Germany if you have any tips

277
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm making a multicultural relationship work in this case the American guy in a German girl please let

278
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:27,280
me know hmm well that's an interesting question I think about that I don't have I'll have

279
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:36,480
never gone out with I mean I don't even know German women I don't think the only German women

280
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:48,160
I know are the ones that uh that make my Audi that's the only German women I know

281
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:55,120
that are usually named Helga but somehow I doubt your girlfriend's name is Helga or nor does she

282
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,120
look like she should be working in an Audi factory I don't think it makes any difference man

283
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,880
whatever you're from it really doesn't as long as there's love as long as there's love and

284
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,200

is it hey baby I want you to come over here and take off your dress and I'll put my cowbell

286
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:35,440
okay all right Gary thank you very much Merry Christmas to you and uh into your girlfriend

287
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,680
let's see about 25 minutes into the show so we're gonna be perfectly on time the way I have

288
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,640
it plan at this point actually I was gonna talk the day today and we were emailing back and forth

289
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:56,400
and yeah and I had half of an idea maybe we could do a trade secrets although I'm a little

290
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,600
bit concerned still about his setup because when he's recording and there's something funky with

291
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,400
his new computer and we have to get this fucking fix because if it's skipping while he's recording

292
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,920
that's just not gonna work because then we can't do the the dawn and drew double ender trick

293
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,080
because we won't be in sync and I'll have to now that's gonna be a fucking nightmare so

294
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,640
and then he sent me a link to the latest morning coffee notes which now of course is on scripting news

295
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,240
and I figured out maybe today would not be the day a great day for even just a social chat on the

296
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:39,280
hell hello hello um this is a uh I feel better but my voice doesn't sound much better

297
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:47,040
it's really interesting way of speaking because once they start getting going you know no when

298
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:55,760
it's gonna just jump up normally I have a fairly deep voice but when it's in this mode

299
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,160
just never know um when it's gonna jump up about it you know this reminds me of do you remember

300
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:10,080
that episode of the um the cartridge family when Peter was going through puberty and he would sing

301
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,320
and then his voice would crack and then you know it was like a real big problem because he had to

302
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,720
do this solo during a really big concert and then what they did is they eventually changed the song

303
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,800
or they did a special song for him to sing which was about changing let's go

304
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,760
hey Dave you're going through your second puberty it's at 49

305
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:43,680
anyway I just was reading a thing that said that Elliot Spitzer is running for a governor

306
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,480
of New York State I just thought I could die with me like that run for a governor anything

307
00:27:51,200 --> 00:28:03,120
what if he wins people say governor Spitzer you'll be able to kids love a great time

308
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:24,480
or sorry I have a fine mood that's right oh man that's frightening when Dave talks you know what

309
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:31,520
we should bug him home on a second he's been posting eyes aware blog he wants someone to call him

310
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,720
he has like one of these 206 free numbers let's see if you can do this I think what would be

311
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,800
kind of let's give it a try I'm gonna try to do it on Skype with Skype out even though I'm on

312
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,680

313
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:57,520

314
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,720

316
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,120
that's when she should be admitted 23rd is when the actual operation takes place and we're
