00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Good afternoon from Curry Castle. It's the Big 4 O birthday show. I'm Adam Curry.

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Today is Friday, September 3rd, 2004, and it was 40 years ago today that the nurse said

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
in the Audentine Hospital, ma'am, if you don't push, we're never going to get this kid out.

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,500
And that was me, born on this day in 1964. You listen to the source code. So good morning,

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,500
good afternoon, good evening, wherever you happen to be listening to the show. But of course,

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,500
it's probably on a commute from point A to point B. This is the only spot on your portable MP3

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,500
player device that has a playlist where users and developers party together. So I've just been

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,500
saying at home for my birthday today, nothing too special.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Birthdays actually pretty big deal in the Netherlands. Typically the birthday boy or girl,

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
hold on, we just took this off for a second. The birthday boy or girl will get,

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
they'll have a special chair for them all decorated in the morning and presents are given

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in the morning and breakfast. We're not that Dutch per se, but since I'm home anyway, kind of chilling out.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, just had a nice easy wake up call for my 40th, which is good, a nice way to ease into the

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the park where life apparently starts where everything begins at 40. Excuse me.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My buddy from the radio show, one of my two colleagues, Alexander stopped by

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to another typical Dutch tradition and he actually drove for quite a distance to come here and he

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
just stopped by just to have a cup of coffee and chat and he gave me the most awesome, awesome

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
birthday gift. When we moved to the Netherlands,

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,500
about over four years ago, I already had Curry.com, which I was using quite happily.

20
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,500
And well, Curry.nl had been taken a long time ago by Hines, probably.

21
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
And I guess they have as much right to it as I do.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
But Adam Curry.nl had been hijacked at the time.

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I was like, yeah, whatever, I've got Curry.com.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
I was never really planning on doing a Dutch weblog, which by now I've been doing it.

25
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Keeping in touch with a blog.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
it just became live.curry.com slash Dutch and you know what people find it anyway, it's no big deal.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But what Alex and I did is he went through the time and the trouble and this is what makes

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
us such a great gift to reclaim my domain name for me and it already links to my to my Dutch

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
weblog. So that's and he also promises going to renew every single year. So it's the gift that keeps

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
on giving really. Adamcurry.nl that's my Dutch weblog and still posting on it though a little

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
less frequent as I used to and I was really doing the radio show in Holland and you know just

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
keeping up with everybody. Now I'm focusing a lot more of my time and attention on the

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
English weblog on curry.com. And I think I mentioned it yesterday just so you know that you can get to

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the archive of all of the source code shows by going to dailysourcecode.com that's dailysourcecode.com

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
all three words written together. And the RSS feed if you want to subscribe to it we are pumping out

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,500
So which means we have enclosures and those enclosures can be parsed by different aggregators,

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
which will pull out the MP3 files for you.

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
And if you feel like it, you can use the iPodder.

39
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Now available for Windows, for Macintosh, for Linux, also for Pocket PC.

40
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,500
And I just got some really good news that there is a version that works with Windows Media

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Player. It hasn't been released yet.

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
This is done by Erwin.

43
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
And he based his code on the iPodder for Windows that works with iTunes.

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Now what's great about having a release for Windows, the worst with Windows Media Player

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,500
9 is that Windows Media Player 9 already has all kinds of different connections with

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
different media devices.

47
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
So when we talk about the iPod platform, of course, we're only talking about all devices

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
that are portable to play MP3 files.

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
So this is a big breakthrough.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,500
And what I had hoped is, remember I told you that someone had...

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
claimed iPodder on SourceForge.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now it's going to set up a central resource.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now if I don't see it appeared this afternoon

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
or by tomorrow morning, then I am going to start up

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
a central spot, which will probably be SourceForge.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just so we can aggregate all of these different scripts

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and have it in one spot and then have us

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
get it probably find out if we get a good URL to point to it.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But we really have to start pulling this together.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because it wouldn't be amazing if you could

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
create a little toolkit.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Here's a thought for you.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If we create a little toolkit, let's say

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to publish a program and I already have the software

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
to do it.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But what I want is I want to make sure

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that my built-in audience who may not have already

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
been exposed to iPodder, that they can basically just

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
click on a standardized link, subscribe with iPodder,

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
whatever.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This link then will, if necessary, download a version

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
appropriate for your system.

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
including the feed that you just subscribed that you just looked at.

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,500
So they'll have one or however feeds that particular program producer wants to put in there.

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
And if you already have an iPodder, then of course it would hopefully only

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
subscribe you to to that feed.

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
I know it sounds trivial, but these are the things we still haven't gotten working on weblog.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
So I think we have quite a way to go on that one.

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Lawrence Lee sent me a note.

80
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,500
And he too was interested in the iPod platform and working with iPodder.

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,500
And he said, well, you know, there's a couple of different angles we should we could approach this from.

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,500
At the rate we're going, we're going to wind up with many, many different scripts for many different devices.

83
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Wouldn't it be simpler to create one centralized aggregating resource?

84
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
And that's where that's where I say, I don't know.

85
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I don't think so. You know, I think that this stuff has to be so decentralized, not just because of the load because there is death.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
definitely load when you're doing any type of central aggregation.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But also for control, there should be no control, there should be no one in the middle

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to grab control or for even to be the possibility of having some kind of control.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I just don't think that's a good idea.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But certainly something that we need to look into before we blow it off entirely or at least

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that I think we should look into different ways of approaching this problem.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But as I said, I'm really happy with Erwin's Wendell Media and Windows Media Player Number

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
9.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hi Anya.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What is this?

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Huh?

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
From the close to fans.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, I'd play that.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, nigga.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It was off the safe.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, don't kill.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was on your…

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She helps out of here.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And so when I dropped off a nice gift for me, a nice bottle of something.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Very nice.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Thank you.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you very much.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Great.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So this…

114
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
the Windows Media Player 9. I think that's a big win right there because it's basically,

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
you download the script, it brings the stuff in, you have a feeds file, you drop anything

116
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,500
into that feeds file you want, and Windows Media Player 9 can already sync up with a whole bunch

117
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:03,500
of different portable devices, and probably they have the, it's set up with vendors of MP3 players

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,500
so that they can, I guess, get something into an update of Windows Media Player or something

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
that's downloadable so it syncs up. I mean, that would only make sense that they're working hard

120
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:23,500
on that, so we can piggyback on all of that work. I also got a request to discuss the legal issues,

121
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:32,500
specifically of playing music during one of these programs, and I don't think I want to go there,

122
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I don't think I want to get into that discussion on this program, or I don't really want to get

123
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
into it at all, because it's, it's, it's,

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
such a big discussion that will really bog down the work we're doing.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In the case of source code, first of all, the rules are a little bit different in Belgium

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and in the Netherlands and in the EU in general.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So, you know, there's, I'm not too worried about the RIAA clamping down on me because quite frankly,

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm outside of the jurisdiction and reach and there's no partnership agreements whatsoever

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
on that front.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Or at least as far as I know, there's no agreements on that front.

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But also, you know, most of the stuff I'm playing, I've played so many times throughout my radio career.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I've made definite money for people along the way and I don't think that anyone who owns

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the copyrights on these pieces of music, which I know most of them personally or I've met

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
at least once, they'll make a big deal out of it.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And, you know, copyright laws can't be intended so that when we're working on development

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and research, that's exactly what we're doing here that we can't...

137
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,500
you stuff that's out there to do this type of research. Now if I was trying to make money on this in some other way,

138
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
that might be open for discussion and I think that it's something that should be discussed, not right now.

139
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
You know, now we're in R&D mode, we're digging down and trying to get

140
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
trying to get everything working. And I think we're having a lot of success. The

141
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
the Dutch Telegraph,

142
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
as I said yesterday pointed to the inquire article and to the iPod or scripts both the Mac and the Windows version.

143
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,500
And traffic has been amazing. I think a lot of feedback here from people in the Netherlands.

144
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Let me just see

145
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I guess, Lawrence Lee, who had the, I think I messed it up there.

146
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Lawrence Lee had the legal question, and it was Andrew Davy, who had the question of

147
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
centralizing the aggregation.

148
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Or perhaps, here he says something interesting here.

149
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
He believes the development of community should work together to create an application that

150
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,500
handles the nitty gritty of RSS parsing and provides a simple extensibility model for other

151
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
people to plug into.

152
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Okay, so he's saying, why don't we build an aggregator?

153
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
And that may make sense, but again, you're going to get into, I think you're going to

154
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,500
get into Holy Wars of what language do we use?

155
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,500
And I think it's relatively simple enough that, hey, if I could create one of these things

156
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
to work, then almost anybody can.

157
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
And all we need is a couple of good versions that connect with all the right bits, and

158
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I think will be good to go.

159
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
So anyway, I sent everyone a note back.

160
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,500
He was going to talk to Peter who created the original iPodder for Windows, who asked

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
because he used some of his code,

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
well actually what he did is he removed the Apple script,

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
or the iTunes code and put in the Windows Media Player 9 code.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So already we're working modular across the board.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Very, very fun to watch.

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Something that I watched on my computer yesterday

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
was the most recent Apple keynote

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
from the Apple Expo in Paris.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, although he can't help it,

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
it was very disappointing that Phil Schiller did the keynote

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
because I'm a big Steve Jobs keynote fan.

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I love watching the way he presents,

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and how he handles the stage.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it's really a joy to watch him do that.

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Phil Schiller actually did a pretty good job.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And it was fun to see how a format of a show like that,

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
because you know exactly what's gonna happen,

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
right?

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's gonna talk up some stuff in the beginning

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and run through some of the stuff you saw

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
at the previous developer conference keynote.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It brings three vendors on stage,

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
one of the internal guys, they'll sit, you know,

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
stand behind their Mac show off their...

185
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,500
stuff, then you get some other wind up, some stuff in the middle, and then one more thing,

186
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,500
then we need the box to rise out of the stage. It has the new iMac on it, which by the

187
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,500
way does look very sweet. So that format was already there. That was cool, and Phil just

188
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,500
kind of fit right in there. But even though he did a different, amazing job, he still doesn't

189
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,500
have that presence that Steve has. And of course, that's because Steve Jobs was a

190
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,500
operated on, and he was at home recuperating. Phil Schiller said during the keynote that Steve

191
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
would be back in September. So I guess he's just about ready to start now. Although the one thing,

192
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,500
and these types of things they say about CEOs who are out of action,

193
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I think hopefully most people care right off. How is Jobs doing? Is he okay? Is he

194
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:35,500
and your house is health? Unfortunately, the investment community.

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
meaning Wall Street is paranoid about this type of stuff and they really want to know

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
how is he doing? Is he coming back? And it's important to them for their investment strategies

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and because it will, it's already affecting the content, no matter what.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When when Schiller did is I chat AV demonstration, if it all possible, that's where I would have

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
said, hey, you know, why don't you I chat Steve at home where he's recuperating? I mean,

200
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
if he's going to start in a couple of days or a couple of weeks, then presumably he would

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
be fit enough to do that. Of course, I didn't choose to do that and that it only makes me

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
hope that Steve Jobs is recovering very well and either didn't think of it or it was too

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
late for him or whatever, but that if he really is a fully recovered or almost there, that

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
would have been great. Just from a show perspective, you know, again, all I want is the best for

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
anyone certainly when it comes to health. So, let's see.

206
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,500
There was a little more in-depth demonstration of Safari RSS.

207
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,500
And I remember commenting, I think on my web blog about the unveiling of Safari RSS.

208
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I thought jobs, uncharacteristically, didn't do a very good job of explaining what you

209
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:55,500
can use this for and what Safari RSS will give you, what kind of benefits it will give you.

210
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Phil Schiller did a much, much better job.

211
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
And it looks like these guys really put together something excellent.

212
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
It's basically, it's a built-in aggregator, but not just an aggregator where you can

213
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
subscribe to stuff.

214
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
You can easily make up sets of aggregated content.

215
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,500
So you can say, here's all of my feeds that I'm subscribed to.

216
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
And they do that with bookmarks, by the way.

217
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm going to make a collection, so I want all my computer feeds here.

218
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,500
And I think you can mix and match and slice and dice those collections almost on the fly and create a new one.

219
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
So you can just be looking at subsets.

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
that's of your already pre-aggregated data.

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And then when you have that,

222
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you can also search through that aggregated

223
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
through those aggregated feeds.

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And you keep changing your view.

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So not really getting results,

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but you're getting different feeds.

227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And there's even a slider bar

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
so you can say, okay, how much content do I wanna read

229
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
underneath each entry in this aggregator

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
so it can be one line of text

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
or the entire text or anything in between.

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And it's just, it blew me away.

233
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It looks like a really, really good aggregator.

234
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Now, of course, the questions are,

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
will it support enclosures?

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And here comes the big plea, hey guys,

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
could you please connect it to iTunes?

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Wouldn't that be great?

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It would certainly make this,

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
well, we're trying to achieve a lot more robust

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and much easier for people to use.

242
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And it could open up an entire market.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So that's a question that remains to be seen,

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but I'm very bullish on Safari.

245
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,500
because they've got to have a database under the hood too.

246
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
It's very excited about that.

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Of course, that'll be at least another,

248
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
probably another seven to eight months before that comes out,

249
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
maybe even longer, they're talking about second half of 2005.

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So remaining with Apple, oh, here's something I noticed.

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's just kind of cool.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Here's something, you know, if you have an iPod, and I'm sure that most of these earphones

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
are built in a similar fashion, the iPod actually, I'm going to take one out now because

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm wearing them, listening to the monitor of the recording.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The two ear plugs are different.

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It even has one has an L on a right, indicating L on R, indicating left or right ear to

257
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
be inserted into.

258
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But they're not symmetrical.

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So they are built in a certain way that you can actually put it in.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It goes underneath, kind of, I'm sure that has a name, I should Google that.

261
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What's that little thing on the inside of you?

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The little inner low, I guess.

263
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And then it kind of just hangs behind there and just kind of sticks in there and it's a real

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
comfortable fit.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I noticed something the other day when I was in a group of different people.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And remember, I'm 40 now, so you may...

267
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,500
not to have the same results with people you know. But I, this is great. I found out that

268
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:09,500
people who have had a facelift can't wear these earphones because a part of it, and of course

269
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,500
has to be a serious facelift. So what they do is they pull the skin of the face back towards

270
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,500
the ear. You'll see people who had a couple facelift, you'll see their ears are kind of on the

271
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
back of their head. But in the process of doing that, it kind of tightens everything in that

272
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:32,500
that inner load part just becomes straight. It doesn't really have a little piece sticking

273
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,500
out where you can clip an iPod earphone behind. So just thought that was interesting, a

274
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:48,500
little faxoid. And of course that would open up a market for facelifted earplugs. And one

275
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:56,500
other thing looking at this entire keynote is that Apple along with...

276
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
most other companies that are in the business of MP3 players, all they talk about is music.

277
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's all they talk about.

278
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The iPod is for music, it's for bouncing, it's for, you know, look at the commercials.

279
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's, you know, listen to different music, share music between different computers, stream

280
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
music, buy music from the IT music store.

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm like, wow, you know, this is, why are they driving it all towards that?

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I haven't heard anything about different uses of audio.

283
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And there are so many different uses.

284
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It seems like we're not only have we forgotten what you can do with audio because we're

285
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
so video-minded I presume.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Just like we were rediscovering the written word and web logs and how powerful it can be

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and what you can achieve just by writing something, we're going to go, I predict that we're

288
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
going to have a kind of reinvention of the wheel with video and audio, of course, will

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
probably happen a little bit sooner just because it's easier.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You know, we're able to transfer these large audio files and video files, you know, it's,

291
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think they're still a little bit too big right now for the...

292
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,500
hard to space and processing power well processing power is okay but bandwidth certainly is a problem.

293
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:11,500
So anyway they're just not talking about it and you know that I find that kind of weird because we're

294
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,500
you know we're going to go through people creating you know the old fashioned radio shows where people

295
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,500
are acting stuff out and and interviews and there's just so much more but not a word everyone's talking

296
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,500
about music as if you know that's the only thing we can do with these devices so go figure.

297
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I had hoped at least somewhere that people would pick up on audio books because you know I've

298
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,500
been talking about audio books Dave Winer has been talking about audio books. A lot of people are

299
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,500
using these I think that there's a definite market here. I fact I saw that a quote by the CEO of

300
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,500
audible.com the other set of the other day saying that you know they're doing fantastic. I'm sure

301
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,500
it's his job to say that but he the quote read pretty sincere. Now I've been

302
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to review an audiobook or two here on Source Code. And I thought I was going to step away from it,

303
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
but then I thought, no, it's such a great part of the content of the iPod platform that isn't

304
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
being talked about. I think we should do it. And there are lots of people who are listening to

305
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
to audiobooks. And I reviewed a couple of them, but here's something cool that happened.

306
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Through Track Back, I received a comment on one of my audiobook reviews from Eric Rice.

307
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm going to pull up his page here because what he doesn't have is, hmm, I'll see.

308
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, he has a little spinning beach ball of death. He's giving a second.

309
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So anyway, he's using, I think he's using audio blog.com to post his audio blogs.

310
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And I never used it, but from what I understand with audio blog.com, you best be set it up

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and then you dial in with a special phone.

312
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,500
number or use do a select a phone code once you've dialed in. You record your audio blog,

313
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,500
you press star or hang up, and then it automatically posts it onto your web blog. Well, so here's

314
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,500
what happened. Eric is listening to Source Code in the car. He hears something about audio books.

315
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,500
He wants to respond to it. He calls up his audio blog.com account and leaves the following message.

316
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There comes, hold on.

317
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
everybody is there from air christ dot com

318
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
on a very warm and beautiful when they hear in california

319
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,500
uh... today's audio blog is actually for adam curry i a uh...

320
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
like adam i drive a tremendous amount

321
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
during the week

322
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
and something we probably put similar miles on our cars and i'm looking to a

323
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
daily source code mp3

324
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
it's a kind of content that i can take with me a little bit different than some

325
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
audio blog for audio blog more streaming the more momentary

326
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
uh... probably takes more work to go ahead and load it up on your iPods and it

327
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
does actually fit it play and

328
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
figure out that the amount of the business with me so

329
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
uh... he's talking about audio book and he talking about

330
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,500
reviews of audio book and i have to pipe in here because i recently purchased

331
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,500
at another audio book and i'm starting to do to join the audio book bandwagon

332
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,500
primarily because of how much time i spend in the car

333
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
uh... like everybody else got an iPod

334
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
and i am hopelessly addicted to one book

335
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
and i think it's because of the

336
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
the reader

337
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
the guy who narrates the story

338
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The book is something that probably most technical folks like.

339
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's a cyberpunk thriller called Snowcrash by Neil Stevenson.

340
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I have the unabridged version and it's 18 hours long.

341
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll tell you, there is nothing cooler than listening to Snowcrash, especially if you like the novel.

342
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And driving, especially at night or when it's rainy and nasty.

343
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've actually video blogged this before.

344
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's a book that really just draws you in.

345
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Jonathan Davis does a phenomenal job of reading this.

346
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So I actually went on iTunes to search for more audio books that are read by Jonathan Davis.

347
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Now I know Jonathan Davis is a part of our work.

348
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
There's just a little snippet from Eric Rice.

349
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So here's what I find phenomenal.

350
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So he wasn't necessarily responding to a book that I was talking about.

351
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But he was responding to audio to my program about audio books.

352
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And he gave me an idea.

353
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Let me tell you, Snowcrash by Neil Stevenson was the inspiration for Metaverse.

354
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
which was a domain name that I registered in the 80s.

355
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
It was a very early 90s.

356
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,500
And I was right after MTV.com, that's right, Metaverse.com.

357
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
And I actually had an agreement with Neil Stevenson

358
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
that, you know, he said, you can use the domain name, no problem,

359
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500
as long as you don't merchandise the name, Metaverse for T-shirts

360
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
or books or films, whatever.

361
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
We had a little contract and it was perfect.

362
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
And he actually thought it was quite an honor that, you know,

363
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
he was this place in cyberspace called The Metaverse.

364
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500
If you've read Snowcrash, then you know that The Metaverse is basically,

365
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
it's basically the net.

366
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,500
It's the internet in this book and everyone can jack into it.

367
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
But you really jack in 3D.

368
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,500
So Snowcrash has such, you know, I love that book.

369
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I really did.

370
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,500
It gave me a whole different view on where we might be going in the future.

371
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,500
So I thought, hey, you know, if there's an audio book version

372
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,500
and Eric Rice, who apparently really appreciates the speaker,

373
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
you know, then this is a book that I want to have.

374
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
And yeah, I think I can...

375
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and divvy up 18 or 19 hours worth of listening to Snowcrash. I'm sure, yeah, I mean do it.

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So the real interesting thing here is this feedback loop that was created.

377
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Let me talk about what happened first, and I'll get back to the feedback loop.

378
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So check how the flow of money went on this. So Eric says, check out Snowcrash.

379
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I go to audible.com, and I'm like, you know, I hope they have it. Type it in Snowcrash.

380
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You know, Stevenson, yeah, on a bridge version. It's there. And then I see a banner up at the top.

381
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And believe me, I don't think I've ever purchased anything off clicking on a banner.

382
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But it was for John Stewart's new book, which audio book of his book. I guess he has a book,

383
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
but this is the audio book version, which he goes through the history of America and democracy.

384
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And see, the Snowcrash book was $34.95. And I thought that was a lot of money for it. But you know,

385
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
of course it's 7, 18 hours worth. But still, you know, I think I'm in.

386
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
That's a lot of money for one book.

387
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,500
John Stewart's book, on the other hand, was $7.95.

388
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm not sure how audible does this, but apparently it's like each time you buy a book, then

389
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,500
you get a book credit, and then it's subtracted from your next purchase.

390
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,500
So I had a book credit from my previous purchase, and what I thought was really nice is that credit

391
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
was applied towards the $34.95 and not the $7.95.

392
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
So I basically got the John Stewart book and Snow Crash for $7.95, and I feel really good

393
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,500
about myself, and they're both in great quality with great speakers.

394
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
And the John Stewart stuff, I haven't finished it all, so I don't want to do a review until

395
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
I've heard all of it.

396
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
But it is phenomenal.

397
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
And it's exactly what I was talking about.

398
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,500
He has different speakers, different voices, he has sound effects, he has, it's a real radio

399
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:31,500
show almost with people acting out parts, and it's just so well put together.

400
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
And he also has a very nice speaking voice for audio.

401
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,500
So if the audiobook business doesn't...

402
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
see this and see how simply it goes, you know, than they're crazy. And I think that we can be a part

403
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
of that ecosystem one way or the other. See, there was everything else about the John Stewart book.

404
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh yeah, I do want to say something about John Stewart book. I want to say that,

405
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
unfortunately, still can't seem to get a steady RSS feed of daily shows. But I know John pretty

406
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
well because he started out, as many of you may know, at MTV, he had a show called the John Stewart

407
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
show. And that was on about six or six or eight months before I left MTV to go and start my company.

408
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And we hung out at the very first MTV V-chows. And he's a really nice guy. And he was just at the

409
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
wrong spot at MTV. You know, they were so overprotective because you couldn't piss anybody off,

410
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
no record companies. You had to be politically correct. That's what the rock and roll video station was

411
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and still is today. And so Comedy Central of course got a...

412
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
over the years because they had the same problem because it's also an MTV network,

413
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
so via a common company.

414
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Somehow they were allowed to become the bastard child and of course they've been very successful

415
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,500
with many shows on Comedy Central, think of South Park, think of Daily Show and of course

416
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:05,500
this new comedian who I just saw on a bit torrent of Jay Leno, was in David Chappelle, America's

417
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,500
funniest man and I'm also going to download the Dave Chappelle shows.

418
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:21,500
So one thing that I of course I'm just astounded by is that Audible does not have RSS feeds.

419
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Think of the opportunity here, just think of the opportunity if I can create an RSS feed

420
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,500
and say well I'm only interested in these types of books where I'm not interested in this

421
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,500
or I like this particular staff pick so give me his or her recommendations in my feed.

422
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Oh it seems like so incredibly simple to do this stuff.

423
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And you know what? Maybe there's a market right there for someone putting together a feed

424
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
of audio books. It doesn't necessarily have to be, you don't have to be selling them.

425
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You could be through an affiliate program. All kinds of opportunities with this stuff.

426
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay, so what I did want to say about the feedback loop of audio blog.com, that really connected

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
to me because what's so great about radio is that you are always involved in a community.

428
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Typically, or at least the way I think radio works best, it's within a city, or within

429
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
a certain region so that they're talking about stuff that you are familiar with. And not

430
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
just some guy like sitting at Clear Channel pushing buttons, firing off local jingles.

431
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So on Philadelphia, it sounds like he's local and saying, you know, in Iowa. And another

432
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
part of that community is that radio stations often use the telephone as the feedback loop.

433
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So you can call in. Yeah, you may not get on the air. In fact, you probably won't get on

434
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
the air, but I'll tell you, on morning shows, there are many lists.

435
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,500
who are regulars because they always have something funny to say and some of them eventually

436
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,500
get a hotline numbers they can call in directly.

437
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,500
But most of the time the calls are screened at larger market stations and these people are

438
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
professionals they know how to pick someone funny out of the...

439
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
to create that feedback with which is a beautiful one if you think about it because here you are

440
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,500
you're listening to the radio you're listening to a talk show you hear someone say something you hear

441
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,500
a phone number you pick up the cell you dial it you talk to a producer if you're lucky you get through

442
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,500
you're on the air boom you know you're on the radio you're in the loop now our system won't work as

443
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,500
immediate as that but of course it doesn't have all the drawbacks of a centralized system as well

444
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:33,500
mainly that you can't own one and you can't have one but we can use this audio blog system

445
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,500
now I thought about it just briefly last night before I went to sleep and we have to have some

446
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:49,500
kind of way of trying to tie in you know maybe if this is the source code for for September 3rd

447
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,500
when you dial into a special number you're going to say okay I'm responding to the source code

448
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:01,500
September 3rd and maybe you you type in oh nine oh three oh four and then it knows that wherever it

449
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:10,500
sends this

450
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
your message to it knows to attach it to that audio blog post or to that particular show in

451
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the ART program and the archive, which could be here we go I'm thinking now I know developers

452
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,000
out there help me out here. In theory I think it should be possible to make use of the comments element

453
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
in RSS 2.0 and I think that if I'm mistaken the comments can also have their own RSS 2.0 feed

454
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and then those would include enclosure attachments of the audio blog responses.

455
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Now the first thing I thought in this structure is okay that's great but we're going to get lots and

456
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
lots of spam of people calling up and I said well you know what? No we won't because we're going to

457
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
charge him. If you want to comment then you know you're going to have to pay a little bit so that

458
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the service is paid for and so

459
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
that the feedback loop is completed and also to combat spam.

460
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,500
If people had to spend money on email spam, there would be a hell of a lot less spam.

461
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,500
So that should be fairly easy to set up.

462
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,500
And maybe a way to make money.

463
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,500
If you haven't got enough people who are compelled to drop 50 cents or a dollar or God knows how

464
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
much, maybe 20 cents or 9 cents, I don't know.

465
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
If you have enough or calling up, that could be interesting.

466
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
But anyway, the feedback loop is the main thing.

467
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:42,500
And I'm going to look into audio blog.com and see what kind of API, the application programming interface.

468
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:51,500
See what we can do if we can talk to it, if we can tie it into existing programs and

469
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,500
then in an archive using the current weblog technologies.

470
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:01,500
And they sound a little bit discombobulated, but it is because I'm still trying to figure it all out.

471
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Okay, we are damn 34 minutes into this.

472
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,500
It's my birth.

473
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
day today so I get to select the song of the day and I chose for a classic by Jackie

474
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
DeShire. What the world needs now is love, sweet love, people are thinking.

475
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:30,000
What the world needs now is love, sweet love, it's the only thing that there's just too

476
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:42,000
much love, what the world needs now is love, sweet love, no not just for some but for

477
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
oh oh oh Lord we don't need another mountain

478
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
there are mountains ready, and you're tired, we need enough to climb

479
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
there are us

480
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,500
As two in the time

481
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
What the world

482
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
We are

483
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
With her

484
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
Sweet love

485
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
It's the only thing

486
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
It's just...

487
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Do you know what the world is?

488
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Not...

489
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
It's not...

490
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Sweet love...

491
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
No, not just for some...

492
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,500
But for everyone...

493
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So

494
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
What's up

495
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm living out

496
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Let it cry

497
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Sweet and heart

498
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's the only thing

499
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
That there's a chance

500
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Do it in love

501
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Oh, I'm, PAYS NOOOO

502
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Sweet and heart

503
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm, OH, IT'S LAST

504
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sweet and heart

505
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
No, not just for some

506
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, but just

507
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Now you know

508
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Here Add另外

509
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Everyone

510
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Please

511
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Is that?

512
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Is that

513
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The

514
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is it?

515
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I must remember to turn off other applications next time.

516
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I play a song on the day because someone came online and my eye chat definitely let me

517
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
know about that in the middle of Jackie D'Shanan's what the world needs now, which is really my

518
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
only true birthday wish. And that's it for source code for today. We'll be back to,

519
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
no, promise myself we're going to do anything on weekend. So tomorrow, I'm at the air show

520
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and Lailie start all day. I'm being picked up at 10. We're flying in. I'll be there until

521
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
about 5. And I will be updating. What I'll do is I'll see if I can keep the computer running

522
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
here so I can do some GSM phone updates and also take the big camera for some really high

523
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
quality pictures because there's going to be some classic planes there and if you're

524
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
into aviation, it should be exciting. So look for that tomorrow on live dot curry dot

525
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,500
If you want to respond just leave a comment there on the post for this program for today

526
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Or of course you can also send an email at atom at curry dot com and I will see you on Monday

527
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Have a good one everybody bye bye

528
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

529
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
I'm not sure I can win here.

530
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
But I'm not sure I can win.

531
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
I'm not sure I can win.
