00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
scree

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,480
When I'm in the kitchen

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,180
all taken up, didn't connect

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,620
on English and Rezyli Slim

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,600
Takeout at the show

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,380
monarch or naked

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,280
Now just wander around

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,360
Come on and do it

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,000
in the Netherlands, I'm Adam Curry, welcome to the really big show. How y'all doing? It's been okay

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,400
here, it's almost time for me to go back home. Back to Jolly Ode England, I got to tell you, I am pretty

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,360
much ready.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,920
But of course, I'm celebrating my last night here in, uh, with all my friends from the source code.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
We're going to go for my life.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
We can't start the show without, at least not a show at home without a fight.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
Okay, and this is being a severe issue.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,680
Okay, so I'll have to figure out where the lighter went. Luckily, lots of music

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,920
planned for this evening or this morning, or this afternoon, depending on when you're listening

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:45,200
to this podcast. For some reason, I've been really inspired by being here to play more music

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,800
on the source code. Part of it is, of course, because, you know, I've been talking about it,

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,000
talking about fighting the next, the next Beatles, and that we could actually find and support the

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,640
next Beatles through podcast. It is completely possible. And also, there's a lot going on in the

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,920
music scene here. There really is, and people have been sending me all kinds of links to mashups,

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,440
mashups, but also some just great independent music that, uh, it totally has been just blowing me

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,280
away in its quality and, uh, and just, you know, there's a, there's a lot of, a lot of community

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,640
stuff happening here. Um, so, uh, today, and maybe, you know, also because we're kind of into the, uh,

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,240
the, uh, the end of the year and, uh, shit, you know, you've already heard my news. I have the best

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,160
Christmas present ever. Um, so goodbye to my mom. I can go back home tomorrow to be with Patricia

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,000
Christina and the in-laws, of course, will be with us for the holidays. Um, and my mom is doing great.

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,040
And, um, yeah, I, I think, uh, she's on a very good start to a, to a, yeah, a road of recovery,

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,040
which is going to still take quite a while. But, uh, anyway, lots of good vibes, uh, everything's been

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,840
received, feeling good, ready to go back home. And, uh, oh, my, what, I got some, uh, uh, a cadence.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,680
I got some more cowbell for everybody. Actually, this is from, uh, Jim Davis, and when I first heard this

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,480
like, I recognized this. I think this was done by a friend of mine. His name is Ben Libron. He's a pretty

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,680
well-known remixer. This is basically pieces of full metal jacket, remixed. Well, you'll get the

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,160
idea. But it's just where those things are kind of. It's a bit militaristic, but yeah.

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:42,320
Me, my look for my, uh, lighter. That's enough of samples in a local culture.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I don't want no G-D-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D.

38
00:04:32,160 --> 00:05:02,160
want do have life? I don't want each other. I don't want no G-D. I don't want to be here. I don't want no G-D. I don't want no G-D.

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
I don't want to wait, I don't want to be bad

40
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad,

41
00:05:34,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I don't want to be bad, I just want to be bad, I just want to be worse anymore, I just want to be worse, I say i don't want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse, I just want to be worse,

42
00:06:34,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm going to use a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

43
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:34,160
All right, we'll close the gates, we'll come at now Those are the hardcore champions and make sure the lines stop only Stella SuperHooksets, Captain Don't miss those who don't has the same size. Yeah, I don't know

44
00:07:34,160 --> 00:08:03,800
I know about you, but I just can't sit still when I hear stuff like that.

45
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,240
I'm 99% sure this is a Bentley Brom Mix of Fomeral Jacket and whatever stuff.

46
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,840
I think this is something that was from the 80s and one of the radio shows we used to

47
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
do back then.

48
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
That's probably why someone sent it to me.

49
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,480
He said, love you, show newbie, hope to be a podcast or some day.

50
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm so sure that this is, whoops, that was weird, haven't had that happen, yeah, did

51
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
you hear that?

52
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,280
Oh boy, hopefully everything's going to keep working here.

53
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,480
But I wanted to actually, I did something productive today.

54
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,760
Do you remember I was in Hilversum a couple weeks back and I was there just overnight and

55
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,440
I'd also gotten a super fast internet hotel.

56
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,440
This hotel is better by the way than that one, comparable in price, but that doesn't

57
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,800
really matter.

58
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,160
I was there to help a couple of friends out.

59
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,440
They were recording a television pilot to talk show with two of the guys that I worked

60
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,040
with on my morning radio show.

61
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:09,520
So today, I went to the headhonshow with the TV network, SBS, who I sold, the Adderous Family

62
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,120
Reality Show to, had a nice chat and I think we pretty much sold this show into one

63
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,480
of their TV networks, which is really great, we're really all pretty fucking excited.

64
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,560
Because it was a long shot and everyone just kind of came together and everyone chipped

65
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,800
in and barely no money on the table.

66
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,560
And now everyone will have a job if we're lucky, which is going to be very, very

67
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
cool.

68
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
And so I'm excited about that.

69
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,000
So that was a productive bit of the day, let's see what else I do.

70
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,160
I actually, I got the, I don't know if I told you that I had an MG and Amsterdam and the

71
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,720
second night I was here or the next day that I was here after I arrived Monday night.

72
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,680
At the end of the day, I went to go get the MG and Amsterdam and drive it back to Utrecht

73
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,840
because I thought it would be handy to have a car, but it's been crappy weather and

74
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm six foot three or six four and I just can't fold up into this freaking MG and then

75
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,280
it's a manual transmission, which I have no problem with, but I'm, you know, I use my right

76
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,560
hand for other things now while I'm driving, you know, now I'm used to automatic transmission.

77
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,240
I know what you're thinking, hey, you know what, let's, let me, I think the mine cords

78
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,240
long enough.

79
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm just going to be a quick little sample here of the night air and Utrecht, I have

80
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,080
a beautiful balcony and I got this great mic, so let me see if we can catch some sounds

81
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,080
here.

82
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,080
There's some people biking.

83
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Going home.

84
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I wonder how that sounds.

85
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Okay.

86
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
That's enough.

87
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Too much fresh air for you guys.

88
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,080
As I said, lots of music lined up for the show and by the way, it is evening for me.

89
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
It's a quarter to ten.

90
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
It's a quarter to eleven here.

92
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,360
It's a quarter to ten in the UK, so I'm, I'm trying to kind of live on UK time again.

93
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,320
And I've been just receiving so many beautiful voice comments, audio comments, and actually

94
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:24,160
my mailbox overflowed a bit recently, I had to delete some email because there was so much

95
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
coming in.

96
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,840
I can't possibly play them all, and I really try to stay within some reasonable time limits

97
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
on the show.

98
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,840
40 minutes max, and today may even be just a little bit shorter depends, you know, how

99
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
much, I don't know, just depends.

100
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,240
I did want to play this one though, because this was just too cute, just wonderful.

101
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Hi, Adam.

102
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,840
It's Lance from the Digital Experience podcast, and with me is my wife Pam.

103
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Hello.

104
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840

105
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Hello.

106
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,840
And my son Stephen, can you say Stephen?

107
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Yes.

108
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,840
And we all wanted to say hi to you and to send our best get well wishes to your mom

109
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,840
after recovering very nicely from her surgery.

110
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Can you say get well?

111
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Wow.

113
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840

114
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Get well.

115
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
And Merry Christmas to everybody.

116
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Can you say podcast, Stephen?

117
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Yes.

118
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Podcast.

119
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Case.

120
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Prince of Pod.

121
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
There you go.

122
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
There you go.

123
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,840
So Adam, even though it sounds like you got one of the best Christmas presents

124
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:31,840
around, we all wanted to wish you happy holidays to you and yours and a very best new year.

125
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
All right.

126
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Thank you.

127
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Same to you and everybody.

128
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
And everybody's families out there.

129
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Oh, man, there's just so much.

130
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
There's so much to get through.

131
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
You know, this is really what I need.

132
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I need, you know, people to help me produce the show and produce more shows.

133
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I could do 15 shows if I had people to help me keep track everything and keep everything

134
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
together.

135
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I'm not a manager.

136
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,840
It's like they, you know, he needs some programmers to get some, to get some software done.

137
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,840
That's going to help us, you know, create this, I think, even better infrastructure for podcasts.

138
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
We talked the other day.

139
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
He actually called me from the road, man.

140
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,840
He does his brain work when he's driving holy crap.

141
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,840
And we just, you know, connected on so many different, so many different things.

142
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,840
And it's just, yeah, you know, he's like he's already on his way to, you know, to getting into shape.

143
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,840
And he already feels much better.

144
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,840
And I just saw a web blog post that, you know, he's getting ready to start doing some programming.

145
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
And he's, he's include me in.

146
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
I think I understand it.

147
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
And I'm extremely excited about it.

148
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
So there's some cool stuff on the horizon.

149
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,840
The really is.

150
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,840
I also got a very nice email from Daniel.

151
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,840
I think he works for, for or with American Heartbreak.

152
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Of course, we know, American Heartbreak.

153
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Michael Butler from Rock and Roll Geek Show.

154
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm one of the first, one of the first podcasts.

155
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
And they heard me talking about American Heartbreak playing in Europe.

156
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,840
And he said, they really hope to see me in Berlin with Butler at,

157
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
what is it?

158
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Well, wild the heart.

159
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Wild the heart, maybe.

160
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
On the seventh of January.

161
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
And check this.

162
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
This is the part that I like.

163
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,840
As Michael said, you're on the guest list of every European concert of American Heartbreak.

164
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
I mean, that's, that is like the ultimate.

165
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
That's like Elvis.

166
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
You know, how many bands have Elvis on the guest list?

167
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
You know, in case he shows up and he wants to,

168
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
wants to be in this show.

169
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,840
And I was like, I'm on the, every single show.

170
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm on the guest list.

171
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
That is, I, you know, I've made it now.

172
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
I feel totally, totally honored.

173
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Unfortunately, that's not going to work.

174
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Cause I'm going to be in the States until the 10th of January.

175
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
But I have to check out the website.

176
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
See if I can see if there's some other days.

177
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Maybe that can catch American Heartbreak on tour because that would be cool to catch up.

178
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,840
And also, make sure to check out the podcast, the production show notes.

179
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Now, the HTML version has been kind of messed up.

180
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I don't have that nice, you know, that pretty little rendering that I did before.

181
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,840
That's kind of a part of the server transition.

182
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I just want to get off of the other servers.

183
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Get off of the way I was producing that before.

184
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
This is kind of like a placeholder.

185
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Because I think that what what Dave and I discussed and what's coming soon will be much more smart about how that's rendered and how you can access that and what you can do with that information.

186
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,840
So, I think, you know, just bear with me on that.

187
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
You can still, of course, in the show notes.

188
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,840
There's also the, one of my colleagues here, the show details.

189
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm so professional.

190
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Where it tells you, you know, like the date, the location has the direct download link.

191
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,840
And also, a download to the bit torn version, because we're going to have to start figuring that stuff out pretty soon.

192
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,840
So, even though it's not in the RSS feed, I'm already putting it into the show notes, which you can get in OPML version.

193
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,840
And as I said, kind of the messed up funky, what the fuck is this HTML version?

194
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Something else that is, is just in the show notes that I kind of left in there is an email from Charles Kellin, Charles Kellin,

195
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,840
from the Guilford songwriters.

196
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,840
And you should check this out, because basically, he's inviting me to come to New Year's Eve party at a bar in Guilford,

197
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,840
which, of course, is my hometown now, featuring live music from some top quality local musicians,

198
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,840
which probably ends up in a drunken sing-along, which sounds just perfect.

199
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,840
And, you know, he, I guess, basically, he records this, and this sounds like a perfect podcast.

200
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,840
So, I want to see if I can get in touch with him and see if, see if I can work something out.

201
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
So, that'll be very cool.

202
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Anyone else who's, who's in Guilford, I encourage you to check out the message and come on by if you feel like it.

203
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,840
See what else, you know, I've been, actually, I've been, I've been carrying this one over from several podcasts,

204
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,840
some more about the hacking of the, the I River, the IFP-799, that's the MP3 player that I bought,

205
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:06,840
and I was so appalled that it actually uses its own proprietary digital rights management software

206
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:12,840
to get the MP3s on and off or not, if it's protected in their proprietary format.

207
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,840
And basically, I just been collecting emails and comments and some links, which,

208
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,840
finally, just put pasted right into the, into the production show notes, so you can get a good idea of what can be done about that.

209
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Because there is a firmware update you can run, and you can just basically use this thing like, like a USB external drive.

210
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
There is one comment in here in audio comment that I've kept all that time.

211
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
So, I don't remember what this is.

212
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Let's listen to it. This is from Lee.

213
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Hi, Adam. My name's Lee.

214
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I'd love to show the listening for a couple of weeks.

215
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,840
I just thought I'd leave you a comment about your IR River device.

216
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I heard you've got an IFP-799 or something like that, which got me thinking,

217
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,840
because I've got an IFP-180, which I got about a year and a half ago.

218
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I didn't know there was still making new versions of that series.

219
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Anyway, it looks like your device is much cooler than mine, but I had the same issue with the IR River music manager

220
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,840
when I was fully expecting the device to just plug the device in and have it show up.

221
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,840
As a normal removable drive, turns out you can make it do that.

222
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:34,840
If you check out IR River's downloads, they actually have two versions of the firmware for the IFP devices.

223
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,840
If you actually flash your device with the other downloaded firmware,

224
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,840
when you then reboot it, I think.

225
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,840
You lost me there. I'll listen a little bit longer.

226
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
You lost me with the flash of the reboot.

227
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,840
When you plug it in, one possibility you might have is that I think for your device,

228
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,840
it's still listed as beta or beta or have you pronounced that.

229
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Oh, man, did you read that whole Mary Harder thread about what beta is or not or beta?

230
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Did they say beta in the UK as a beta?

231
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Hey, beta this, baby.

232
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Beta?

233
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Yeah, beta.

234
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Beta?

235
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Should you sell it if it's beta?

236
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
Could you charge for it if it's beta?

237
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I don't know.

238
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,840
So your mileage may vary.

239
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Good work conditions.

240
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Just depends on how much you like trying experimental stuff.

241
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Well, I've been a user for years, so I pretty much love being a beta tester and paying for it.

242
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Check it out.

243
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Hope it's useful.

244
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Thank you.

245
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Love to show you.

246
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Thanks, buddy. I really appreciate it.

247
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,840
So actually, I have the links in there to the firmware hacking page.

248
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,840
And there was one other quick comment I got from Mike Massey.

249
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
He says I was listening to the source code December 16th.

250
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
I heard you talking about the I River Cheese Stick.

251
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
All right, I said it looked kind of like a cheese stick.

252
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
He says, I have one of those.

253
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I agree with you.

254
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It sucks.

255
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
It's not for the camera.

256
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
It's such a piece of crap.

257
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
I got rid of it now.

258
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
I have an iPod.

259
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Oh, you know, apparently there is a fixed word, Mike.

260
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,840
So if you have it, you know, maybe you want to pick it up and play around with it.

261
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Ed Alcoma.

262
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,840
I've been in touch with him.

263
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
He's been around the scene for a while.

264
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
He sent me a link.

265
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I want it comes to mashups and I'm sort of going to look closer to the Mike.

266
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
It comes to mashups and smashups.

267
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Now people are sending me links to all kinds of amazing stuff, which of course could never

268
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
ever be released.

269
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,840
But I'm sure it's okay to listen to in the context of the podcast.

270
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
And I left these links.

271
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Of course, this is from a site that features a series of mixes by a fiction, fiction area,

272
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,340
a fiction area, a fiction area, a fiction area band.

273
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,840
The Beastals is what they're called.

274
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,840
So essentially what we're talking about here is mashups of the Beastie Boys and the Beatles.

275
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I don't know if I want to play one whole song.

276
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
I'll play some snippets of a couple of songs.

277
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840
This one's titled What You Want Lady, The Beastals.

278
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:49,840
So please don't leave until after they finish playing the band.

279
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Right now it's by a great, great pleasure to introduce artists and musicians.

280
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Help us.

281
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Let me listen to that.

282
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Press the bell.

283
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Press the bell.

284
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Okay, so that's one example, right?

285
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Let me give you something else.

286
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
It's weird.

287
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,840
It's really trippy because sometimes I like it and sometimes I really hate it.

288
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
It's hard to say.

289
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Hold on.

290
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Why is my system not firing here?

291
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
There we go.

292
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,840
This is titled Hold It Together Now.

293
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Here's a piece of tape for us in England by Ringo Star.

294
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,840
John Lennon.

295
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,840
George Harrison.

296
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Let's go.

297
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,840
We're gonna start the channel.

298
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,840
We're gonna start the channel.

299
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:12,840
We're gonna start the channel.

300
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
That's different, eh?

301
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,840
I party with the Beasties in Montro, baby.

302
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Yeah.

303
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
They're old now, like me.

304
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Okay, we're more.

305
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
I feel fine right now.

306
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Let's play some more body music.

307
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,840
I don't know how this is turning out at all.

308
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm just tired.

309
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
I want to go home.

310
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I want to be back where there's no bandwidth.

311
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
It's coming though.

312
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
Actually, it's coming when I'm not there.

313
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
When I'm going to be in the States, that's when the bandwidth is coming.

314
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Which of course has me worried that I'm not going to be there for the install that it may not be entirely perfect.

315
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
But it is indeed coming.

316
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
And this is Paul Eastman.

317
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
He has a bunch of friends.

318
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
They got together.

319
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,840
They recorded this song for their own enjoyment.

320
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
He's what he says actually.

321
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,840
I know a whole bunch of people that have had the creativity stifled because of a record company in radio station politics.

322
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,840
A person's career can be in the hand of person that chooses a radio station playlist.

323
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Well, we've gone over there.

324
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
That's how it works.

325
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,840
If they don't like your song, it simply doesn't get heard.

326
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Hope podcasting will finally break them in a lot of the monopoly that broadcasters and record companies have enjoyed for so long.

327
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,840
By the way, I'm not drunk or overly stoned.

328
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
If you hear me kind of tripping over my words, that's a damn hijack.

329
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,840
For some reason, sometimes it trips up and it gives me a delay.

330
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,840
So I'm hearing my voice delay just a little bit in the headphones.

331
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I know that some of you out there who use GarageBan know this problem.

332
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Stuff we got to work on.

333
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Anyway, so as Paul says, here's a little tune that I did with a few friends of mine.

334
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,840
It's a cover of an old song written by Holland Dozier Holland.

335
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Well, we heard of those guys, right?

336
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,840
We have permission from their publishers to cover the song.

337
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
We own the sound recording and we'd love to hear it on the daily source code if you like it.

338
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
It's a mere 4.1 mags.

339
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Hey, everybody, get a mere 4.1 mags.

340
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Here's come see about me.

341
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
It's a song, watch your way, don't feel it.

342
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
That's what I never told you.

343
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,840
It's easy for you to feel it.

344
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,840
I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, it keeps me crying.

345
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you.

346
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:51,840
I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell all I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to told you, I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you,ー

347
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,340
Keeps me crying, ever for you

348
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,840
So what you hide, can I avoid and see you happy?

349
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I say we've got a way to know

350
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I say we've got a way to know

351
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Say we've got a way to know

352
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,340
I'm not a baby, I don't believe

353
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,840
But my heart says you're happy

354
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
No matter what you want to say,

355
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm not a baby, I don't believe

356
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,840
I'm crying, ever for you

357
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,840
So what you hide, can I avoid and see you happy?

358
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Say we've got a way to know

359
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Say we've got a way to know

360
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Say we've got a way to know

361
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Say we've got a way to know

362
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Say we've got a way to know

363
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm not a baby, I don't believe

364
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
But my heart says you're happy

365
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,840
I'm crying, ever for you

366
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,840
So what you hide, can I avoid and see you happy?

367
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
It makes everything more different

368
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:33,860
So we'll play

369
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,860
My love

370
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:46,820
My Love

371
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:56,260
Yeah, kick-and-women, I need that when you might have to have the Incranette

372
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
King going on the pitch.

373
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
Yeah!

374
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,260
Oh, take it up there.

375
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
There you go.

376
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,260
I've got a lot of news and we're easy listening.

377
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Look at that.

378
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Oh, make it easy.

379
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Look at that.

380
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
Morning, midnight.

381
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Good night.

382
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
Incranette.

383
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,260
It's all right.

384
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,260
It's just right.

385
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,780
Yeah, that's it for the Daily Source Code for today, a little bit on the short side.

386
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Three minutes.

387
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,780
But...

388
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,780
It's all right.

389
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,780
So, I've got, I'm feeling good.

390
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:29,220
I'm going to pack up, get the show ready to go, most of it, I'm going to pack my bags and tomorrow

391
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,820
I'm out of here after some quick Christmas shopping which of course I have not done yet.

392
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:41,260
It's typical if I have the most of the day to take care of it.

393
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,260
And remember the word is OPML, go home, spread the word, make babies.

394
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:56,900
All right, everybody, some time tomorrow or perhaps Saturday, because I'll be traveling.

395
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,500
They will be in our source code.

396
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,100
If I don't talk to you before Saturday and you celebrate Christmas, I'm happy Christmas.

397
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:15,980
Otherwise, you just enjoy it great weekend, I'm going to talk to you guys soon.

398
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,340
It's all right for the Daily Source Code for the Daily Source Code for today.
