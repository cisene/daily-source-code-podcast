1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
One casting with Adam Curry

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The power of the Lord gives the power

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah! Everybody

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's his Monday

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Monday, the 22nd of November 2004

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Welcome to your daily source code

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the UK

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How to do it

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The power of the Lord gives the power

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm just getting everything all situated here

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hold on a second

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I got a little set up

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I got the new studio happening

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Or at least parts of the new studio

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And the most mundane part is not quite done yet

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's the chair

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm all twisted and contorted

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just in my self position

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm talking to the microphone

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Otherwise I'm doing fine

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What a day today, man

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you saw the update on my weblog

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You know that today did not go the way we planned

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In fact we had planned something totally different

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That what happened when there was a knock at the door

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Early this morning

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Power of the Lord

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So let me get into this with you right now

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let me tell you what happened

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sorry about that

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That was a nice fade out

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wasn't it?

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So this morning

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The authorities who had already been here

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Twice inquiring about our dogs and cats

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Arrived once again

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And said, you know, we've really looked at everything

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And we thought about

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You know, your story

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And although we totally understand how things went

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, unless you can produce the proof

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That after these animals had rabies

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Injections

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That their blood was tested for the appropriate levels

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Of whatever it is

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You know, if you can't produce that

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then we're going to have to put them into quarantine for six months

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello, good morning everybody

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank God it's Monday

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So that was an interesting start

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And it was almost impossible to find

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The vet who had performed

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All this passport stuff

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For our two dogs and two cats

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And of course this is a Belgian

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You know, like a real farm vet, you know

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And he also does pets but he does cows

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And horses and stuff like that

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, you know, we couldn't get a hold of him

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then they said, well, look, you know

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Unless this guy can come up with the goods

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Then we'll be back at three o'clock

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And we'll take your animals into quarantine for six months

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And by the way, that's a Heathrow

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's not anywhere near where your house is

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you can imagine that we were all kind of like flippin' out

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I literally sent my assistant

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To Belgium

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
To get the right, you know, paperwork

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Basically, yeah, the paperwork and all the right signatures

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And all the right stamps

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And facts to me within like 45 minutes

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And maybe, I don't know

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Maybe five minutes before they came back

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
With the guy with the van, you know

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like, almost like the dog catcher, you know

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's like, this is the big van

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We're gonna put your animals in

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And you won't see them for another six months

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Whew

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The facts just came in

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And these guys were very understanding

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They were nice and, you know

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And they could have caused us a lot of trouble

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because basically we messed up

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We trusted too much in what our vet

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In Belgium told us

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And so even though we're all in the up and up

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It totally was not the official procedure

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it was totally appreciated

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That they, you know, they got all squared away with us

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, but that totally blew out

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Most of what we were planning for today

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And boy, we had a lot to do

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So we've still been working

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Relatively late this evening right now

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's 9.15, 9.20

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And we're still unpacking boxes

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Figuring out where we can put stuff

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm getting a little bit closer in the infrastructure

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Of all of our stuff here

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And man, when I say infrastructure

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I really mean infrastructure

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We got lights that need to be hung up

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We got still waiting for the broadband

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Talk about that in a second

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We have phone line, we have one phone line in

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, actually, let me talk about the infrastructure now then

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So first of all, even though I said it

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
On the previous podcast, I want to thank everyone

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So much for being so incredibly nice

115
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Welcoming us to the UK

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A lot of people who live here

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've already kind of figured out where we are

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just purely based on the comments that I've given

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I appreciate you kind of keeping that quiet

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And off of the message boards

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But it's good because now people are starting to send messages

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
About where we can hook up

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Where I can use a Wi-Fi hotspot

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Still looking for some friends for some of that other stuff

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Which I have a

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I got a couple emails about that as well

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That even though in the UK it's okay to do more than just walk on the grass

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's pretty much something you just don't want to talk about too much

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Because then you can get into trouble

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So message understood point taken

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And who wants to get into trouble, man

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Not with a man

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I wonder what we say in the stage

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The man is going to come and get you

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What do they say here in the UK?

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The bloke?

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The bloke is going to come and get your ass

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh man

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How much do you hate it?

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You just absolutely hate it

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
When Americans do an English accent

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I talked about that with the

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Colin from the BBC from the culture show

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Who produced the segment more news about that

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
As well later on this show

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And as I suspected, they really hate it

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They hate the posing Americans

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Who try and pull off the accent

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And Madonna with her Pollux

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For more on that conversation

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Refer back to the podcast

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That we did while the BBC was recording their culture show piece

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Back to the infrastructure

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've gotten a lot of emails about British telecom

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
BT as we say here

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Which confused me for a long time

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because BT used to be a client of mine

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In New York that would be bankers trust

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Bigger derivatives trading bank

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So let me see

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So basically I have the provisional line

163
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I found out today

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's still a provisional line

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Which means I mean some kind of computer hell

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Because something hasn't updated

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Which is also cool because I'm

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You know basically not paying for this line

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yet they don't even you know it's a provisional line

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Means that it could still go away

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If there's a problem with this number or whatever

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You know that sounded a little bit vague to me

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But so once the provisional portion of that is removed

174
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then I can order the broadband

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And what I wanted to do is I just wanted to go with

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
British telecom to get there

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Was it the BT Yahoo broadband

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Which seems more or less like what I had in Belgium

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There is a limit on the bandwidth

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But I've kind of learned to live with that

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I figured let me just get going

182
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Get something happening then I can always switch to another provider later

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
At least let me go with someone who I can call the time and bitch Adam

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And so lots of comments coming in

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And all these of course listed in the show notes

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He had a great podcast

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Beware of BT broadband they capture monthly usage

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Which isn't a great idea

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is from Philip

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mizzledine

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mizzledine

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mizzledine

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Philip

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And he says that he uses a demon

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who let you surf without a cap

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And he's also said that he has a free view card in his PC

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So he's going to record the culture show and high quality on Thursday

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's great that's said the BBC show

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Which will be on at 7 p.m

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BBC 2

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Here in the UK including a segment about podcasting

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I got a great email from Colin

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He had created a nine minute piece

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Which is really long when it comes to when it comes to anything on television

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Anywhere

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It got re-edited down to six minutes

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Which happens in TV

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But he said it's great he says he's very happy with the end result

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sure he's pissed that they cut out three minutes of his work

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And that of course is how it goes

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the commercial airspace

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If you know what I mean

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So that was basically a con BT email

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I got another one from Rachel

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Saying you may be visiting Starbucks a lot more often

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In BT to connect you Monday the ongoing service is good

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But the ability to connect

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Was slow six months ago

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Apparently a lot of bad news about

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
About BTs

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I guess they're brought in offering getting all ramped up

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So let me see

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I got one more which

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think I got a pro

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A pro BT email here as well

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hold on a second

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, here we go

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm using this bluetooth wireless mouse

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Which is from Mac mice

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's pretty cool although I've noticed that

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
As you run more and more applications

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And the computer starts to

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Use the processor

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The mouse is a little flaky

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Not that it won't respond

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But it responds like maybe with just a hair of a delay

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Which is not exactly what I want

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, here is one from Martin

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
From Green Dragon Online.co.uk

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Says got to come to the defensive BT on this one

241
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He said it was connected within seven days

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And that including them sending him the modem

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He said he was pleasantly surprised at their speed

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know if that's the speed of their service of

245
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Getting him connected

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Or if that's the speed of their actually actual broadband

247
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And there's all kinds of stuff here

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's most have one megabit down

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
About 256 kilobit upload speed

250
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Although I have seen

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Some ADSL listed as three megabit down

252
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
With 512k up

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So again, I just want to go with the tried and true for now

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just get me rolling with BT

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I need them anyway

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That that has the provisional stuff has to be set up for anyone

257
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can do anything with my line

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And if I wanted to use another provider

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'd have to wait until I get my account number

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Which is probably not until I receive my first bill

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So I'm hoping that the BT can get me going

262
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Pretty darn soon

263
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But again, we've got Starbucks just five minutes down the road

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So not too big of a deal

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Shoot, let's play some tunes here

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm getting a dry throat

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We're now, what are we, we're ten minutes into the show

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And let me see

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What do we have?

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh yes, this is something that I found

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is it in my iTunes inbox

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Or see I now, since I've been using iPod or how I call iTunes

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know, the what's new playlist is also

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Become an inbox whoops

275
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is from Bungwater

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I've seen an important graphic part

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Anyone to have an affair on the source code

278
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So I just move on down to the

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Met your pilot and the museum of art

280
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
To look at all the sayders with your heart

281
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Above and near

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,080
There are thenecks to the Big Meat Ball

283
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,000
There are bronze muscles

284
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Flexing under their good for loin squats

285
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You know, little bit near

286
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm just locating a funny bike

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The Дon 트� sisten the corner

288
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The d partial drums

289
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not calling here

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
omma

291
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I sit on an imitation neoclassical chair and wait,

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and wait, wait, wait.

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I look to a guillotine full like the mirror.

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's like a breezy stringy hair,

295
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and I think, oh, have won't like it like this.

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, then I check out that shit, believe it.

297
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, with this one,

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and I think, aching, we're nipple-free.

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I want that stupid dude.

300
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And how about those promenades that is hot,

302
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
you look big babes,

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
me, present a two-o-polo,

304
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that needs his nephew,

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and I want those other way home,

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and I think, what about those stupid ass?

307
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm not getting up to say they was born with their hands.

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I'm bound by God's will,

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to be putting the laws on his right,

310
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and tell them to touch his life,

311
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and let's be into that 16th century tapest dream.

312
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, it's a chord, huh?

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But it's just like I'll hopefully have the wrong ones.

314
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

315
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And even though he's not the kids,

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
she's just in full stride,

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know what that shit wouldn't do.

318
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's my hate as singing.

319
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Lime for all the way.

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I run out of your no one.

321
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I run out of your no no one.

322
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I run out of your no one.

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I run out of your no one.

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I run out of your no one.

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:19,000
know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know it I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,160
a windscreen. There you go. I don't have one on this microphone. I don't know what happened,

328
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,600
but I don't know if that happened during the move or while it was sitting in its case. This

329
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:35,240
sure is an SM7. Is the SM or SMB? It thinks the SM7. And the windscreen is just deteriorated.

330
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,120
In fact, the whole inside of this box, which is a nice plush red inlay, you know, where you

331
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,440
can slip the mic right in and it fits in. It's not just like one of those gun cases, or yeah,

332
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,480
that the assassins have. And it's a nice little road steel road case, so it's protected.

333
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,920
Yeah, the windscreen was just deteriorating right inside in its little slot. And so pieces of red were covered

334
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,320
in black. And well, subsequently I have no windscreen. So actually, I should just steal a pantyhose.

335
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,520
That's the whole pirate way. The blogger way of creating a windscreen. Here's a tip for you. In fact,

336
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,120
I haven't done this a long time. I can't wait to do this. We used to do this to the pirate radio stations.

337
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,920
So you get a code hanger, right? And then you kind of make a circle on one end about the size

338
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,120
that you want the windscreen to be, which has to be bigger than the mic itself. And then you pull

339
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,000
a piece of pantyhose tight right over that. And then you can attach the other end of the code hanger

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,360
to your microphone stand and a kind of position it so that you have a good windscreen. And I'm

341
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,880
going to do it even cooler. I might even just try to go to the local music store and find a windscreen

342
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,880
but I could use that USB mic that wasn't good for me as a USB mic. I could use that as my windscreen

343
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,720
because it has a nice, you know, swansneck adjustment. So okay. Anyway, end of the meantime, I'll try

344
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,600
not to laugh too hard, or at least not laugh into the mic. I just want to plug a website that Todd sent

345
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,440
me an email about. And again, on the show notes for today's we can find more about that Todd

346
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:15,240
Maffin sent me the URL to radiodaddy.com site is being developed as a free service to a

347
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,800
loud change of voiceover between radio stations worldwide. The premise of the site is simply

348
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,200
you need a voiceover recorded. You come to radiodaddy.com post your request and a member

349
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,920
records your voiceovers and MP3 file uploads it back to radiodaddy. You return to the site download

350
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,720
your free voiceover and voila, new voice on your station. It's free. Oh, yes, you do the free voiceovers

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,640
for our members as well. So it's kind of like a voiceover exchange. It's like a swap meet of a radio

352
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,040
IDs and voiceovers, which is cool because a lot of people are doing that a blogger kind. It's great

353
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,520
to hear all these different people saying, hey, this is so-and-so on the rock and roll geek show,

354
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,120
where hey, this is so-and-so on the Don Andru show and all this cross-pollination is really cool.

355
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,440
And it makes us sound like a station, like a radio station used to when you had fun, you know,

356
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,440
sometimes in each other's expense. So it's good. I totally recognize this type of fun.

357
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,480
A couple of things I want to talk about as well as we continue to expand the infrastructure

358
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,520
after reviewing all the different calling plans, all of our options. And basically, you know,

359
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,040
finding that until we have our bank account opened and credit cards and, you know, some kind of

360
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,560
credit history built up in the UK, there's no way we're going to be able to purchase cell phones

361
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,800
on a contract. So the only real option that remains open, which actually turns out to be a pretty

362
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,400
good one is Virgin Mobile, a good old Richard, man. It's like, they've got this whole philosophy.

363
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:50,760
You should check out virginmobile.com or virgin.com slash mobile and read about the philosophy of

364
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,480
why they do the billing the way they do it, how they operate. And it's pretty much what you'd

365
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,160
expect from Virgin. It's good. And I felt very comfortable purchasing not just one, but three

366
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,560
of their phones. We all got one. And I got the, let me scrub better here. Hold on. I need to

367
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:17,160
charge it as well. I got the Sony Ericsson K700i, which is it's small. It's a little bit smaller

368
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,800
than I'd like. And I don't know if this battery is going to last as long as I wanted to,

369
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,840
although I did a lot of calling today because of a lot of crap. Oh, I go on on. But it's good.

370
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,160
As a great camera and a VGA camera. So really good quality pictures. And that's probably what

371
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,880
I use it for the most outside of using it as a phone. And it sinks with my Apple Macintosh,

372
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:45,560
another big plus. About 18 minutes into the source code for this Monday, November 22, 2004.

373
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:53,560
So really can recommend the Virgin phone experience. Really friendly people to help you out

374
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,200
to really explain everything. And it's just low hassle. And you don't feel hassle at all.

375
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,240
There's no one like pressuring you to get this or get that. It's good. And it's got interactive

376
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,840
screens. You kind of help yourself. But help is there when you need it. I liked it. The depressing

377
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,400
part, of course, is you get a new phone. And in this case, it was really relatively easy for me to

378
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:25,080
copy my data from my existing Nokia phone over to this Sony Ericsson just by re-sinking my Mac,

379
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,080
which resinks the calendar address book. When I was at a couple other things that sinks up.

380
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,600
And then realizing that maybe I should remove Teofon Horses number. There's a couple of

381
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,320
other people who passed away since I've been maintaining my phone book. And you see those numbers

382
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,600
passed by. And I'm like, wow, three. Three since the past phone that have passed on.

383
00:19:51,320 --> 00:20:02,760
And I left them in. I left them in. I also sent the OSMS from Patricia and I. Even though

384
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,160
he was already dead, it was before his funeral. And I was really happy to see that when they

385
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,600
buried him. This is the sending us the filmmaker who was murdered recently.

386
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,120
Started off a big wave of unrest in in the Netherlands and actually in certain parts of Europe.

387
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,880
And the European Parliament is upset and worried. They buried the O and they buried him with

388
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,040
this gullowild cigarettes with his lighter and with his mobile phone. And so it was kind of cool

389
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:39,560
to know that my SMS surely was going to be buried along with them. Okay. Let's see, moving along.

390
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,480
What kind of email was this Philippe? What did Philippe say? Oh, yeah.

391
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,960
Philippe, student at University of California, San Diego. Listen to the data source code every day.

392
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,320
Really enjoy your show. Thanks for all the work you put into podcasts. Check it out.

393
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,120
Why do you let you know that I just bought a new vanity license plate that would read podcast?

394
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,000
And he's wondering if if I could do the same here in the UK. I did that once. I did get a vanity

395
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:19,160
plate. I got mine in shoot man. I want to say 1994. And it was dot com. New Jersey license plate.

396
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,240
And at the time, people would actually stop me or come up to me at stoplights and say, hey man,

397
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,760
yeah, the internet is cool because no one had heard about it. Really, you know, like dot com.

398
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,320
And so the very few people that recognized it, you know, it was like instantaneous recognition.

399
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,480
It was kind of cool. It was it was a very in thing. Of course, only a few years later,

400
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,400
became the most wrong thing to have in the world is a dot com vanity license plate.

401
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,600
But it was fun, what it lasted for a while. I wanted to have, I had a Rolls Royce at one point,

402
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:56,360
which I wanted to have a vanity plate, MTV dot com. My lawyers like didn't want me to do that.

403
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,640
And shoot, you know, we started a company instead and had a lot more fun than that.

404
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,120
And our good buddy Doug K is pretty much in the podcast mode. He has an announcement for us,

405
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,640
which came through his channel just a few days ago. Actually, a little bit longer than that.

406
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,600
Is this a week old already? Have I not played this? Well, if not, it's information you need to know.

407
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:32,280
Hello, this is Doug K, the host and producer of IT Conversations. And although I'm responsible

408
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,160
for all of the audio, you hear here on IT Conversations, I'm not really a podcaster in the same

409
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,120
sense as Adam Currier Dave Slushar. But I want to bring you up to date on some of what's happening

410
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,200
here at IT Conversations. And I guess it's time I did that using audio, not just my blog,

411
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,000
which, by the way, you can find at blogorithms.com. One of my goals has been to create 300 programs

412
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,560
in the IT Conversations archives by the end of this year. And when I roll out everything that's in

413
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,920
the current production queue, I'll be at 291. That means I've got seven whole weeks to produce just

414
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,440
nine more shows, so that should be pretty easy. Many new listeners, the IT Conversations are overwhelmed

415
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,160
by the size of those archives, and they don't really know where to start. Sure, it's easy to pick

416
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,880
the latest programs from the home page, but there are scores of great some would say even better

417
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,480
programs in the vault that newcomers just can't find. Long time listeners know that I've steadily

418
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,040
expanded the breadth of programming on the site, and although I still call it IT Conversations

419
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,080
for lack of a better name, it's not really just for IT, nor is it just for IT professionals anymore.

420
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,200
In addition to my own interviews in the Gilmore gang, I've added Halle suits memory lane,

421
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,360
Dave Slushar's voices in your head, which are interviews with sci-fi writers and others,

422
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,240
and Scott Maze's new series of interviews entitled Opening Move. And of course,

423
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,560
they're all the conferences that we get ranging from O'Reilly's emerging technology conference

424
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,480
and Ozcon to Supernova, Noemdex, BloggerCon, and PopTech. And you can be sure there's a lot more

425
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,160
to come after that. But because of this breadth of programming, I recognize that not everyone will

426
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,560
want to listen to every program. That's okay. The same is true probably for TV networks or even

427
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,240
NPR. My first attempt to make it easier to find what you like and ignore the rest was to create

428
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,680
separate RSS feeds, podcasts, if you will. Now listen to this because Doug K is doing some

429
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,600
really interesting stuff, and listen to all the stuff that he has done that he had set up before

430
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,320
podcasting, and really how professionally he is in this whole approach. I got to tell you,

431
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,960
man, I'm really looking forward to working with this guy in the future, because he's definitely,

432
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,520
although it's narrow casting, it's a definite niche. I think it's brought enough to actually,

433
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,520
you know, to be something cool, if you will, for each of the series and topics that I produce.

434
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,400
So instead of subscribing to everything from IT conversations, which is as many as 5 or 6

435
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,120
new programs each week, you can now just subscribe to your favorite series like the Gilmore gang

436
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,400
or topics like software development or security. By the way, if you don't already know about

437
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,600
these options, just go to the left side nav bar on any page on the IT conversations website,

438
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:31,080
and you'll see a list of the topics. I'm not sure where it is on the website, IT Conversations.com,

439
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,600
that's why I've played some of that for you. Here's just the ending bit.

440
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,000
patience.com. Of course, any comments, suggestions or other topics are welcome as well. I'd love to hear from you.

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,320
On a more personal note, I'm going to be taking a couple of weeks off. I'm having a bit of

442
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,120
surgery on Friday, November 19th, nothing too serious, but they tell me the recovery is pretty

443
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,920
gnarly. So I've cut up two weeks worth of programs that will launch automatically between now and

444
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,600
December 1st. They include the rest of the presentations from BloggerCon 3 and more of the terrific

445
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,360
sessions we've had from PopTech 2004. And don't forget the latest edition of Dave Slusher's Voices

446
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,720
in your head that we published today and a new Gilmore gang that will be up on Thursday of this week.

447
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,840
Once again, this is Doug K, the host and producer of IT Conversations, and most of all,

448
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,320
thanks for listening to IT Conversations. Talk to you soon.

449
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,640
Okay, so a couple thoughts about that. You see how he's got a whole station together and I really

450
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,280
dig that. And this is, I think this is kind of what I want from the Pod Squad, how I would like to

451
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,280
talk about people and it's kind of already happening organically. So we don't necessarily have to

452
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,880
have it on one website, although that might be nice. You know, stuff to think about there. And I had

453
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,680
a quick, I think it's an instant message, your email conversation with Doug, and he's doing okay.

454
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,680
He said, it hurts like a bitch. I have no idea what that means except that it hurts like a bitch.

455
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,200
About non-R-I-A-A music podcast tunes that we like to play on the daily source code,

456
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,440
which means that we have a license to play them or the license is available for review that

457
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,360
lets us know that we can play it and don't have to, at least not in the way that we're using it

458
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,760
here on the source code. Notice me talking in the Royal Wii, we don't have to pay any royalty or

459
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:37,480
license for using it. I know the president and the founder of a pretty big medium-sized record company,

460
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,040
which is rare, because there aren't a lot of independent record company publishing companies.

461
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,200
And I've known him for a long time, he's been responsible for a lot of big names that anyone

462
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,480
would recognize. Of course, I'm not going to tell you who it is because this was a private conversation,

463
00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:01,240
but we've been keeping tabs on each other for shoot, man. I'd say close to 20 years.

464
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,680
And in a way, I think I'm partially, a little bit of his prodigyase. He's always followed the stuff I've

465
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,760
done, and there's a lot of comparisons with our backgrounds. I agree or wise as well.

466
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,640
And except I never really went into the record business, but just, well, you know what I mean.

467
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:29,240
And I said, hey, why don't we get some of your music and you give me a license to play it on my podcast.

468
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,280
And he says, you know, I really, and this is, this is really sad. He says, you know, I'd love to do it,

469
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,520
but if I do, then I will set jurisprudence, which means all kinds of people from within the

470
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,120
industry are to come and jump on me, which could actually mean that I could be out of revenue for

471
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:53,080
real, not because of theft, but because of the lawsuits and all the jurisprudence that will be set

472
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,200
within the industry itself. And I thought that was so freaking sad, so sad, because this is it.

473
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,960
This is why the music industry can't change, you know, because it's going to eat itself up.

474
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,640
Then, you know, the minute one of the wolves shows some kind of, quote, weakness, then the other ones will just jump on it and have it for dinner.

475
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,240
And it really, really, it struck home, you know, it's like, it's just not going to happen.

476
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,480
They're afraid themselves. And this guy is certainly a guy who could do it. He could blow up his company.

477
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:30,360
And he's, he could blow the whole thing up, make no money for the rest of his life and still be an incredibly rich man

478
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,320
for the rest of his natural life. I don't think he could spend at all.

479
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,120
And still, you know, he doesn't want to take that challenge. He's afraid about it.

480
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,280
And so I said, you know, instead of going off on him, I said, well, okay, you know what? We're going to turn around.

481
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,960
Please keep listening to the podcast because I am convinced that we're going to make some stars.

482
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:59,400
And I think that we'll be able to pick him. And, you know, then you can go and do a deal with them and

483
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,840
get him, uh, paid some real money by playing him on, uh, on your distribution. And I think that we've got an agreement there.

484
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,880
And here's a couple of my favorites. The lascivious bitties.

485
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,840
We're going to look at me. I want my own show on TV. I want to be that girl.

486
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,240
I want to be famous. He got it's art. He's had parties at spy.

487
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:54,440
I want to be famous. Go to Paris on private flights. I want to have lovers buy the score.

488
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,560
When we produce is knocking down my door, this is the faith that is in store.

489
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:11,800
Oh, me. Oh, when I'm famous, I will wear a great trench coat and fake red hair.

490
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,960
So they all will know that it is me.

491
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:25,400
When they see me, how they'll smile. And they fold a grass to sign.

492
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,800
I will say sorry, babe. Talk to my assistant.

493
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,040
I want to be famous. He must have loads will bring what I eat.

494
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,240
I want to be famous. Who I do will be news on the street.

495
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Then when I'm old, I'll have a ball. They'll be shocked that I'm living at all.

496
00:31:51,240 --> 00:32:01,880
When I enter the gas will fall to the knees. And then I'll let the throats of my enemies

497
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:10,120
Man, all I don't want and she is when I'm famous, famous, famous, famous.

498
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
I'm so exhausted.

499
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:12,760
Oh, I will be a Barbie doll with huge fake tits. No hips at all.

500
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,920
And I hate us attitude. And throw away, throw away, throw away.

501
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:25,960
Every morning, I'll get high on colored pills. Martin is dry.

502
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I'll let away, and just touch.

503
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:38,600
I want to be famous, famous, better than all of my fellow much better than all of her.

504
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,520
I want to be famous, slowly and alone at the end.

505
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:51,880
I'll hand up bitter and ugly and old, not just my body, but also my soul.

506
00:33:51,880 --> 00:34:00,440
But a legend is my goal and a legend of me. When I'm famous,

507
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,440
not only I'll give, but a little people. I'll have tears when I'm famous.

508
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,320
You know, it's just something so sexy about women this thing that way.

509
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,240
And play their own instruments. The city is bitties. I want to be famous.

510
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,920
You can actually purchase their music. Check them out at lasiviusbitties.com.

511
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,280
That link will be available in the show notes for today's podcast.

512
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,920
While the song was playing, I was actually pulling out a whole bunch of stuff that

513
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,400
I'm going to move over to tomorrow's podcast because we're coming up on 35 minutes.

514
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,840
And you know, I like to try and keep it around 40, which seems to be just the right time for the

515
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:45,560
perfect commute or for your walk, Dave, or your exercise. So I'm going to move right along with

516
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,080
the next audio comment. Hey there Adam. This is Todd over at www.studio and geek.org.

517
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Anyway, I ran into one of your movers the other day of all places in Indiana. And he said,

518
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:07,880
you left this in the back of his truck. Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy. Yeah, we got more and not quite as

519
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,960
as a as funny, but definitely as important. Hey Adam is Scott from today's podcast.com. I was

520
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,600
calling the link. You know, I noticed a little problem with one of your RSS feeds. The one that's

521
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:26,360
coming off of radioweblogs.com. Categories daily source code RSS.xml. Yeah, first of all, I agree.

522
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:34,360
That's confusing. But the actual URL, which does work. It's from the same place is daily source code.com slash

523
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:42,680
RSS.xml. Including the opml file instead of the MP3 file. I was subscribed to that particular

524
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:50,040
feed and was pretty disappointed to not hear today's podcast on the way to work. But okay, so now that's

525
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,600
interesting because I kind of did that as a test. What I did is I'm just trying to figure out how to

526
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:01,560
you know, connect the the shows, the podcast with the show notes. So I did an enclosure of the MP3

527
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,040
and then right on the heels of that. I did an enclosure of the opml file. So I'm not quite sure

528
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,560
what software you're using, but it should have at least got in the MP3 file. And it might not have

529
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,880
downloaded the opml or bulked out, or maybe it did download it. But I don't understand how you

530
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,320
didn't get the MP3. But of course, regardless, I understand that this is it was confusing totally.

531
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,440
Hopefully you can get that fixed pretty quickly, although I think I'll just switch over to the

532
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,920
XML that's coming off of your main website. It's wondering why you had two feeds like that.

533
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,200
Anyway, thanks for the great work. I hope you're moved to the UK work. So pretty well.

534
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Oh, one last note. I was going to mention that the podcast directory looks like it's going

535
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,280
to go over a thousand podcasts this weekend. So that's kind of an exciting milestone.

536
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,040
Again, thanks a lot to you and Dave for all your hard work. Boy, oh, I ended right there.

537
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,600
Okay, so now that is exactly the it seems like we're all on this on this track, you know, and

538
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:02,840
Dave and I are somehow connected. Just connected, not not not through anything that I can really,

539
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,280
you know, point two, but we're thinking the same things almost at the same time. So at the

540
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,560
moment where I'm trying to figure out how to put my opml and somehow glue it into, you know,

541
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:19,240
along with each podcast for the show notes. Well, along comes Dave with, well, first of all,

542
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:26,120
he, he's been working on this bit-torn production system that will create bit-torn type of an

543
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,320
MP3 and then he asked a public question on scripting news. Okay, how should we encode this in

544
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,960
in the RSS file, which started a whole bevy of activity over in the iPodder developers list,

545
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,200
which by the way, anyone can join, please do that's the place for you to go talk to developers who care

546
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,280
and who listen to you as a user, just so only once you use this stuff, you have to have questions.

547
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,120
Now, of course, you know, try and read the manual first. If you can find it, you know, look around,

548
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,840
do a Google search, check out the iPodder directory, the links, there's all kinds of FAQs and

549
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,120
help links and then if you can't figure out, then feel free to, you know, post something to that list.

550
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,600
And just, you know, if you're having problems with something, trying to explain as much as possible,

551
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,480
you know, this is what I did, this is what I expected and here's my question or, you know,

552
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,720
this is what I expected, this is what happened. Okay, which of course will clearly not be the

553
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,720
behavior you expected. So you should, you know, let us know what you expected. Regardless,

554
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,760
there's a great community that's pulling all this stuff together and, you know, and there was all kinds of

555
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:36,600
comments, all kinds of great ideas of, you know, how we can basically start to migrate podcasts from pure

556
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:43,000
MP3 sitting on servers to bit torrents that will share the bandwidth load so that we can, you know,

557
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,480
essentially podcast a hell of a lot longer. We're seeing that some popular shows and I'll just kind of,

558
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,080
you know, running into trouble because of bandwidth limits. And so, you know, one of the ways to solve this

559
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,840
as a community is to, you know, get this bit torrent stuff and the encoding of bit torrent in the podcast

560
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,480
fees, the RSS 2.0 feeds, you know, to get all of that working. On the other end, this, you know,

561
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,240
we also have to bring money into this if we're really serious about it. So, you know,

562
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,600
want to be working on all different angles. And the real important one is exactly that is

563
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,760
getting bit torrent to work. And Marcus Moller, who's been working with me for a long time,

564
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,040
has been working on this with Dave as well. So it's, it's getting, you know, there's some,

565
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:30,040
some movement happening here. And then all of a sudden, like, I think he did, did he write this

566
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,320
on his way? This is how simple the answer is. I don't know if you wrote it on his, it was packing

567
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,520
on his way to the airport. And he probably either posted it or uploaded or finished it off on the

568
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,480
free Wi-Fi at C-TAC, yep, free as in beer. I couldn't believe it myself. And it's a, it's a,

569
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,920
it's a how-to on how to extend RSS and how you can put these modules in. And anyway, I went

570
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,080
being boiling, I totally got it, you know, the minute I read this piece, even better was not just his

571
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:07,560
example of, we had, he has a, a great example of how to extend RSS with a name space. But there's

572
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,560
another example out there, which is the creative commons module for RSS, which is done with name space.

573
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,200
And when I saw that, I was like, well, okay, of course, I totally get it. And I'm, I'm going to,

574
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:26,520
you know, try and work this out for OPML pod cast notes. And I'm not sure if it has should be

575
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:32,440
as broad as OPML, you know, how we attach that, or I don't know, but at least I understand how it

576
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,440
works now. And so I want to put some thought into it and talk to, you know, as many of you as

577
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,480
possible, if we can, now that we know how to put it into the name space, what are we going to do with it,

578
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,440
you know, what are the bits we want to connect and want to glue? I'm excited because I had no idea how

579
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,840
to do it. And now that I see it, it's like, oh, okay, even I understand this. So we're going to hop

580
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,400
on this. You know, I'm, I'm really excited about it. Okay, so good. That brings me up to the last song

581
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:07,800
of the day for this podcast. I got this off of garage band. This is currently the top voted

582
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:19,000
song on garageband.com. It's by now it fit more magic shot. And it's pretty cranky. It's not enough

583
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
there's the title.

584
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I can't believe it when you say it all the time. It's not enough, it's not your train.

585
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Nothing left in the dead end can. It's an empty hand. Take a step to the lower end, you understand.

586
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can't believe it when you say it all the time. I can't believe it when you say it all the time.

587
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I can't believe it when you say it all the time. It's not your train.

588
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I can't believe it when you say it all the time.

589
00:43:45,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I can't believe it when you say it all the time. It's not your train. I can't believe it when you say it all the time.

590
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's not your train. I can't believe it when you say it all the time. It's not your train.

591
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I can't believe it when you say it all the time.

592
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I can't believe it.

593
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I can't believe it.

594
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I can't believe it.
