1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Everybody, thank God, it's Friday!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code for Friday October 15th, 2004.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My name is Adam Curry.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Coming to you from Flander's Belgium from Curry Castle

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
as the girls are starting to tear everything down around me.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The echo is getting larger every day.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're in the middle of packing up for our move to the United Kingdom

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and the drapes are down.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As you walk through the hallways here, you can now hear your footsteps again

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
as the paintings are coming off the wall.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Gold records, awards, newspaper articles, all that kind of stuff

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is all getting put into boxes.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And actually the girls joke at me, my wife and my daughter are saying,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you know, what's going to happen is in about five weeks time.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Everything's going to be done.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The only thing to be left standing when the moopers are done is me standing

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
over my laptop with my microphone and my iPod and its charging stand.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It gets worse.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So I look towards the weekend and which is nice.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Although the weather here isn't too nice in fact,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
this is a kind of dreary day.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And we're entering what I call the tunnel here in the lowlands.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's kind of like a big car wash.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And you go in, it's just all wet and slimy.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And somewhere near March or April, you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and it comes on out.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Anyway, the good news, despite the weather today,

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is that we're back with bandwidth.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, welcome to the show that teaches you how to cruise around

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Europe on one gig a day.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because that's apparently what I get.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you average out the month, having 30 days,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
it's 30 gigs per month, one gig a day.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And of course yesterday was a very low bandwidth day.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And today I'm up to 95% of my total quota.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, hey baby.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sorry.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You told Mr. Who about the iPod?

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mr. What is he?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, the guy, that's the dude who was burning CDs.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, Christina just came home.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He runs at school with bandwidth.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He was?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
His neighbors don't have secured bandwidth, so he never uses his own.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, so he steals their Wi-Fi.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Cool.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And was he going to try iPod or?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now it's iPod.org.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you want to do a video for my answer, please?

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay. Well, that was well-timed.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That was Christina.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Cool.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
As I was just introing the show,

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and apparently her one of her teachers is checking out iPod.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Speaking of the move for the house,

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and for everything over there,

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and also for moving to the UK,

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have to get a couple of references,

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
obviously you need bank references and stuff like that,

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but you also need a personal reference.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And a buddy of mine, actually the first guy who taught me,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
or who gave me my first helicopter lessons,

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I won't say he taught me how to fly,

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but he certainly gave me my first three hours worth of training,

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
was Stu mold pilot that we'd hired when we had the helicopter company.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Retired RAF pilot,

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
he denies it, but I'm pretty sure he was SIS,

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you know, secret air services and all that shit.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And very nice guy, Brett,

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and just to give you a little example of British humor.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So I sent him off an email and I said,

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you know, dude, would you,

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
right now he's flying for the Yorkshire police.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He flies their MD 902 or 900 helicopter.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I said, you know, would you be a reference for me?

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I said, cousin, you know, we're moving.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And he says, hey, I'm good to hear from you again.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Must say I'm a little shocked,

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you're moving to the UK.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everyone here is looking for a way out.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You do realize the country's full of Arab terrorists running

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
drug and prostitution rings, the health services failed.

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Nurses are killing old folks and hospital beds

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to make way for others.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The transport system, any of it, doesn't work.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The police have lost the plot,

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
taxation has never been higher,

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and just when we thought things couldn't get worse,

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
they are forecasting the coldest winter in the UK for years.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And you want to move here.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please don't tell me you're going to sell the lovely house in Belgium

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
or is this another pad you're just thinking of buying.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Anyway, we want to go is really nice.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's at least it was last time I was there.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Very English and far too expensive for asylum seekers,

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I suspect.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We would only be too happy to provide a reference for you.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So long as I don't have to vouch for your sanity.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Give a regards to Patricia who I expect is really delighted

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
about the idea indeed.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So that's the ride British humor for you.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We got lots of cool stuff to talk about in the play.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In today's edition, we'll probably run about 45 minutes.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I was looking for the perfect song to play today,

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because of course I want to try and find tracks that you remember

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you really like, but just don't hear on the radio anymore.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And you don't hear enough super-trap.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Goodbye Stranger on the Friday Edition of your daily source code.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Was it early morning yesterday?

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was up before the dawn.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I really haven't enjoyed my stay.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But it must be moving on.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Like I came without a castle.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Like I came without a drop.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm a dream on another.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And it must be moving on.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now I believe in what you say.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that undisputed?

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I have to have things my own way.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
To keep it in mind.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Like I came without an echo.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Like I came without a jeep.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because I thought I was completely different.

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And it seemed after my beginning.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And now I'm going to enjoy.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Like I came without a drop.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I really haven't enjoyed my stay.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Goodbye Stranger on the Friday Edition of your daily source code.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Goodbye Stranger on the Friday Edition of your daily source code.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000

But I really haven't enjoyed my stay.

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,160
find a Wi-Fi hot spot living in where we live here out in the sticks. Well, unless I had

182
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,120
we'd go war driving I might find something but I'd never really done that in the city nearby

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,000
or in the town nearby I should say. So I took advice from a hot spot locator and I was supposed

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,760
to be a commercial hot spot at a total gas station on the E19 Highway which runs from France

185
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,480
all the way up north to the Netherlands. That's about 15 minutes from my house so I went over there

186
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,640
of course no hot spot at all and you know go and ask the gas station attendant right.

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,440
So I remember that I had installed a couple of EMAX at Christina's old school two or three years ago

188
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,120
and drove over and sure enough popped up the network now the school was closed so I had to

189
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,360
sit in my car because it was raining and the only way to get the signal and I posted a picture on

190
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,240
Curried.com. The only way to get a signal was to roll down the window, have the the butt of the

191
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,200
laptop sticking out of the window about two inches and because it was raining I had my laptop

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
case on top of it and I had to hold everything you know kind of just so for about 47 minutes.

193
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,680
So it was interesting because I was also downloading ran a run eye part and I was downloading

194
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,280
the latest shows and listening to them at the same time and I was just about you know 20 minutes

195
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,200
to spare on the battery with the upload and the download so glad it made it up finally.

196
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,600
And when I talked a day a little bit about NPR National Public Radio in the United States

197
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,400
and podcasting. Now I've been talking to Tony Khan who has arranged for a podcast feed

198
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,200
of morning stories and you can find that in the podcast directory under radio and public radio.

199
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,760
And the more I think about it the more I realize how perfect this is for public radio because

200
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,280
public radio is although listener supported you know they've got money they've got lots and

201
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:52,400
lots of money now like any big organization an NPR is huge you know there's agendas and and people

202
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,920
have you know there's nepotism and friends and links and all kinds of stuff so this stuff is not

203
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,720
going to go extremely fast but from the programmers the people who are making the programs

204
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,320
they see this opportunity and they're jumping at it at least you know the early adopters are like

205
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,200
Tony Khan who by the way please I've pointed to his biography before check them out this guy's

206
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,600
a pioneer, a legend, a legend in public radio and I hope it doesn't mind me saying he's been around

207
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,960
forever but he's and we're going to do some podcasting together when I try to do an interview

208
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:33,360
do a show and he's getting a lot of public radio program makers radio program makers very

209
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,560
interested in podcasting and I think it's a perfect avenue for all the stuff that NPR just

210
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
doesn't have time for you know just doesn't have time for and in fact knowing a little bit

211
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,680
about a public radio and having work for several pubcasters the world over the largest problem

212
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,360
public well certainly public radio has is the commercial competition you know because they have

213
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,480
more money bigger budgets and they create lower quality crap so this is the way to you know jump in

214
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,640
jump in early jump in now and expand your audience just so infinitesimally you know you

215
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,600
would expand it so there's such a degree um I really just you know all the all the possibilities

216
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
are just completely mind boggling and people are already we're already doing this they're already

217
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,760
and I'm finding these and people sending me pointers to them there are so many different

218
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,560
applications that will record your favorite NPR show you know in in MP3 so you can put on your

219
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,400
MP3 players some of them might even put it on your MP3 player I mean there's a whole service a company that

220
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,680
you know VC and venture cap was invested in um what is it called sound I can't remember the name of

221
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,600
that company I'll look it up I've pointed to it before they let you subscribe so they give you a

222
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,280
proprietary iPodder and probably do some encoding on the files so you can't you know steal them

223
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,960
and they charge you a subscription like well but we're already paying I mean I've I've contributed

224
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,040
to NPR why should I have to pay to subscribe to get NPR when I can you know record it myself and do

225
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,560
that time shift really why don't we as the finance years of NPR demand you know hey this is great

226
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,440
this is where we want our money to go we want it to be on the air absolutely we also want to be on

227
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,720
iPods so so I'm looking forward to doing more with Tony and supporting him and what he's doing

228
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,880
because I'm sure because of his background he has some good connection of his own and it's really

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,120
pushing this stuff and there's some technical people on the inside of NPR at least at WGBH

230
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,720
who really understand this and are pushing from from the bottom up as it were and Dave did a Dave

231
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:54,960
whiner did a an interview with public radio and Minnesota on Future Tense show hosted by John Gordon

232
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,040
and I'll play this for you it's about five five minutes and well Dave of course is playing the

233
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,080
same the same flute you know Pied Piper's here and inviting NPR in again in this piece now they

234
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,480
only have a real stream available and I'm just realizing now I probably could have hijacked that

235
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,000
and turn it into into an MD3 but that may be more fun if if we try to you know go through the

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,560
trials and tribulations of playing a real stream together so let's see if it's four minutes and 58

237
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
seconds if you want to skip ahead but I think you want to listen to every single word so I'm going to hit

238
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,800
it now it's contacting host let's see if yet loading listening to the internet this is future

239
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,360
tense from American public media on John Gordon it's called podcasting and it might be the hottest new

240
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,200
thing on the internet a podcast is a talk or music radio show that sent directly to an iPod or

241
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,040
other digital music player through your computer it's a new take on the growing technology called

242
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,040
RSS that pushes text-based web content to computers but with podcasting listener subscribes to audio

243
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,280
feeds podcasting derives its name from the popular iPod player so far it seems to be an outlet

244
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,640
mostly for unpolished sounding bloggers and pirate radio enthusiasts hello again it's Brian

245
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:21,600
support of a podcast and it's October 13th 2004 that opening clip was private life by

246
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:29,360
Oingo going go go out and look for it. This isn't going to be a standard sort of rant I don't think

247
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,040
I have a point to make don't know whether I will do that successfully or not

248
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,640
some of you probably will want to tune out main stream broadcasters like new station

249
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:50,640
KOMO in Seattle and Boston Public Radio Station WGBH are beginning to offer podcasts and observers

250
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,480
see great commercial potential in podcasting technology industry veteran Dave Weiner is a

251
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,560
blogging pioneer and a podcasting advocate he says you can think of podcasts as a sort of

252
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,680
Tivo for radio it's like broadcasting the two in iPod and then take it with you wherever you want

253
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,360
and you listen to the shows that you want to listen to when you want to listen to them so you get

254
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,280
you know geographical choice so you can listen to the for example you listen to a radio show on

255
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,120
which is something that you wouldn't be able to do before or you could listen to a radio show

256
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:35,120
that was local to by for example San Francisco radio station KGO has a talk show that I like to listen to

257
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,560
and if I wasn't Seattle so you know but now I can listen to it because I can just move it over to my

258
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,560
iPod and then take it with me when I go for a walk or when I write on the train or drive somewhere

259
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,480
so it's giving me choice that's the that's the big deal that podcast and we're in a radio

260
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,800
listen to sort of like well I'll take my chances of what's available on the air being like

261
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,560
after the time listening with podcasting I get the control I get the power 10 days ago I'd never

262
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:10,320
heard of podcasting and in those 10 days I've had several people say you got to do a story on podcast

263
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:18,880
and you got up your show has to be podcasted now what happened this amazing all this

264
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,400
amazing and it's the first time I've been in the tech industry now for about 25 years and

265
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,760
this is the first time I've ever seen adoption happen this quickly part of the reason it's been

266
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,920
possible is because of the increased communication that we have through these of weblobs

267
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:43,600
news can travel much more quickly now and so when something new comes along it sort of sparks

268
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,640
everywhere in the imagination like this as or obviously everyone but so many people's imagination

269
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,120
that that it just you know it's a very efficient we have a very efficient communication system now

270
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,680
the reason why everyone's telling you about it is because it's you know RSS which is the technology

271
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,240
that this is built on top of has been something that has been slowly growing through all you know

272
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,480
forms of journalism amateur professional but it's been print because you know it's what it's been

273
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,760
about reading text on a computer screen what's new here is is that now there's a way for a

274
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,960
radio programming to participate in the RSS revolution and so that's why everybody's telling you

275
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,560
that it's time to do it because we want your contact we want your show available this format and

276
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,280
and it's you know and I don't doubt that we're going to get what we want. I wonder if this will be like

277
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,480
other internet applications where yes lots of people will sort of self publish or do their own

278
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,920
radio shows but it will still be the big guys who have the most audience or the most listeners.

279
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,960
Maybe so but at least it'll be a little playing field so that the barrier's entry will be

280
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,520
that substantial. Dave Winner writes the popular weblog scripting news. He also hosts a podcast

281
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,000
with blogger Adam Curry who you may remember from the early days of MTV. Hey Vanessa news

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,720
good morning or good evening depending on where you are welcome to trade secrets on that I'm

283
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:22,400
curry in Belgium. Dave Haskell. Dave Winner at five a.m. in Seattle. You're such a trooper Dave.

284
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:32,000
This is a speech I'm John Gordon. Okay future cast John Gordon pretty good piece there although

285
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,240
the choice of audio clips of course makes me chuckle you know if you choose all the bits where

286
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,920
people are saying I don't know if anyone's listening I don't know if you care what I'm about to say

287
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,880
so maybe a little bit slanted there for the to accentuate the point but totally understood.

288
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,360
Then I was listening to that a couple of things that pumped in the mind one is on traditional

289
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,400
radio you can train to formats and that's just the way it works you know you have a top 40

290
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,480
station old station classical station talk news news sports all sports you know these are formats

291
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,120
and you don't necessarily and the reason why you have formats let me explain that is because when

292
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,280
people are cruising around the dial that's how they cruise or that's what the belief is is

293
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,360
I just you know I want I want to hear some news now boom you got to hear some news got to be news

294
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
immediately and you know when people are going to switch because all the stations in one market

295
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,760
know exactly when the commercials are running on one station the top 40 stations used to have

296
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,600
lights that would pop up that I worked at when the when the competitor was in the commercials

297
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
so that we could hit some music so that when people got bored around three minutes in the

298
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
commercials that read it to switch stations boom we played the biggest hit we have I mean this

299
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,400
is very competitive environment but so it's always going to be music you know so you're not

300
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,320
going to have a station that when you when you when people are switching looking for a music

301
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,840
station that there's something there that you know they're not expecting or they're not looking for

302
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,640
with the podcast you know you can put everything together make you're on a little specialized

303
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,120
station where it's much more about you know about the personality granted you're probably

304
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,960
going to get less of a wide audience but the audience will be very dedicated to that topic so

305
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,200
that's how radio works this is the beauty of all this I've been waiting this for this to happen

306
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,760
for 10 years since the first day I saw a modem and someone pushing PCM encoded audio through a

307
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,960
56k modem I said this is broadcasting I know how to do this we got to make the broadcast part work

308
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,960
and it turned out completely different I had no idea that it would I thought it was going to be

309
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,840
streaming and then I saw them revenue modeled and work on that and this is clearly the way to go

310
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,680
and and I guarantee you that people with iPods will listen to the radio shows on iPods

311
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,680
through whatever means they get on if it's iPod or something it looks like it as long as

312
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,520
I don't have to pay for it I guarantee they're also going to listen to the commercials just

313
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
make them entertaining they can fun again you know you don't you're not constrained to your

314
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,320
22nd or 32nd or 22nd or 22nd with a 10 second tag somewhere else it's you can do all kinds of

315
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,960
new things create be creative every ball that also I just want to say again that the big O wow

316
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,080
factor here is that we as and I'll just call us consumers for a moment here have been marketed that

317
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,160
this you know just the way playlists are set up in in MP3 players you're conditioned to think of them as

318
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,680
tracks as music as you know you can download music and put it on it's yeah maybe the exception

319
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,720
is an audio book but pretty much I think still the whole mass market is focused and has been

320
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,800
conditioned to focus on music as being what you put on these MP3 players and no one really ever thought

321
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,560
about it and then we came along with with his iPod idea and then you know we kind of forced the

322
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,880
issue where once you subscribe then you're going to find out that hey we can put other things

323
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,880
on these iPods and it function is at a whole different device and I think that's what the real

324
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,040
magic is here is people are saying oh wow you know this also and I have something that's even

325
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,080
more valuable than I thought it was and again I think people are just very bored with with the

326
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,200
choice that they have on radio not that radio is boring far be it for me to say that but

327
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,000
certainly certainly needs some more choice let's talk about the cost of podcasting for second

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,600
my cost these days is about $10 a show and that's because I use this fancy wireless mic

329
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,360
setup that takes two nine volt batteries and I was buying my regular pair of batteries the other

330
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,360
day I always have four on hand and I looked at the price and I said actually it's more expensive

331
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,440
this five euros per nine volt battery five euros that's like six bucks and I said you know

332
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,440
excuse me why is this so you know why does this so expensive and lady in the store said oh that's

333
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,680
all taxes I said oh really what kind of taxes oh it's it's taxes for the environment

334
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,320
this is legislation that wants to convince you to use rechargeable batteries you know what I am

335
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,400
fucking convinced so tomorrow I go out and buy me some rechargeable batteries because this is just

336
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,360
this is could get an out of hand let's see um right I got so talk about the iPodder.org

337
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,760
directory this is also something very exciting just like the iPodder developers were were you know

338
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,000
developing iPodders now we have other people who maybe not is technically inclined but really

339
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
want to help out was what we're doing and they're helping out by building this open directory

340
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:20,720
through a format called OPML outline process or markup language and Aldo Castaneda had been emailing

341
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,480
me back and forth and he's interested in business and finance and I think he might still be at school

342
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,040
university let me see if I can um oh anyway he did I remember he did ask about making money on

343
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,520
the trade secrets we played an audio clip from him and he's now managing the law uh node as well as

344
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,800
business and finance and he sent me a node here he says uh actually he says am I missing something

345
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,200
technology wise that makes this idea suck and I'll tell you what the idea was of the answer is no

346
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,560
he says he wants an audio update of new stuff in the category and I think that's a great idea so

347
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,640
if you go down to uh if you go into a category and in this case Aldo is hosting that category himself

348
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,120
so if there's something new you could provide a podcast so just another podcast feed which is an RSS

349
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,680
2.0 feed with enclosures pointing to an MP3 file where you can update people on new shows coming

350
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,480
into your directory they'll receive it automatically through their iPod or right uh and you can play

351
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,600
a snippet or something that they will give people a good idea of what um what that's about what that

352
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,960
shows about and then help them uh go uh to your node and subscribe so I think it's a great idea oh

353
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,640
I was speaking of uh the OPML directory um I got an audio comment about that

354
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,600
hello Adam this is Justin Walgreens from Lost Cruces New Mexico

355
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,200
I had a comment on the feedback you played on Thursday's Daily Source Code regarding the fact that the

356
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:54,640
OPML directory does not have descriptions for the feeds uh I think the directory itself the OPML code should

357
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:04,080
stay the way it is uh just a list of uh XML RSS feeds displaying the title and the description for the RSS

358
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,240
feed should be the job of the viewer and should not be encoded into the XML itself because people

359
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,520
could change the description on their feed I'm working on my own version of iPod or written in

360
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,120
Coco for uh macOS 10 Panther uh which supports this feature and certainly the web interface that is

361
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,000
parsing the OPML and displaying it at ipod.org could be modified to do the same thing uh so that's

362
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,440
my two cents thanks for listening uh love the source code keep it up. Excellent okay thank you very

363
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,160
much so a couple things there first of all is developing a Coco iPod which is great news and he's

364
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,360
apparently already incorporating the iPod directory OPML into that so what he's saying is that we should

365
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,280
let some of that stuff like pulling in the information from the channel from the RSS feeds uh that

366
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,040
should be handled by uh by the iPod or client and I don't know but I sure hope you're uh posting to the

367
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,280
iPod or developer list uh you can uh just go to the iPod.org home page and you can see uh on the

368
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,320
on the links there's the link to the mailing list so please join that the more the merrier and uh

369
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,320
I've seen a couple other people uh looking at integrating this and uh remember I told you about

370
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,800
the servers that Dave and I purchased oh by the way I'm still not verified now I've uh I'm trying

371
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,480
to get a hold of them to get a fax number to send off my credit card and uh and my passport

372
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,840
being the European that I am um uh Dave is set his up uh uh for podcast pings now if you've ever

373
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,120
been to weblogs.com you know that that's the place that you go to see if a weblog is updated uh

374
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,720
there's an HTML interface so you just go to weblogs.com and it tells you what weblogs have been updated in the

375
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,000
past a few hours and you can step through it to go back more hours if you wish the way this works is

376
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,560
just about all blogging software these days either does it automatically your provides a place

377
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,240
for you to enter a URL to issue this ping now the reason why this is important is because at the

378
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,040
at the back end of weblogs.com is an XML file called changes.xml I think there's also a

379
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:12,640
recently change or small changes.xml to lower you know the bandwidth on people requesting this file

380
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,560
but with this file that's something that we could integrate into the iPodders so you could do all

381
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,000
kinds of stuff with that you could fire off emails when a podcast you subscribed to was updated

382
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:31,120
you could make it bold in a window you could just provide a channel guide and say here here's

383
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,000
something new that popped up if it's not in the subscriptions list so a whole bunch of things we

384
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,720
can do and I'm really excited about that and I think I'm pretty sure Dave is going to do some

385
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,360
bootstrapping to get some data in there and this particular source code will of course ping

386
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,600
the URL so you'll at least see my my my podcast show up in the changes.xml so that's kind of for

387
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,400
the developers there also funny Dave recorded actually he I think he even called it is very first

388
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,920
official podcast it was so excited about Google desktop search that he installed it and while it was

389
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,560
running and indexing he he recorded a podcast and he did it on his older machine which I'll have to

390
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,920
say is probably not the most stable thing around or it's it's been known to do some funky stuff

391
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,400
and he's got a lot of shit running on his aggregator and stuff so you know this is why I always

392
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,560
recorded a iFF before and then compressed the MP3 later is because if your machine gets a CPU glitch

393
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,080
you can skip and it'll actually skip in the encoding and most software packages will even tell you

394
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,920
so I'm not gonna play it because it's so hurtful but it was I'm sure Dave was telling a great

395
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:53,040
story and he was talking about fractional HTTP servers and whoops and how oh no second now I'm

396
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,000
getting the funky stuff here from from my setup okay he was talking about how radio had that in the

397
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,600
beginning with using port 5335 and it was great but it was just skipping through the whole thing

398
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,120
you could barely hear a word he was saying so as far as I can insert so far Google desktop search

399
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,760
which of course doesn't run in the Mac totally blows because it screwed up my life and I think I just

400
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,760
thought Dave posted he'd actually he was able to successfully uninstall it and now his machine is

401
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,240
back to normal but the whole concept I think is good and it's definitely a daring move of Google to

402
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,360
do that unfortunately it doesn't work for the Mac and it's not gonna you know even if it did run

403
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,120
on the Mac it wouldn't track any of my files because it you know it looks for outlook messages and

404
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,640
stuff like that okay we're about 32 minutes into the source codes podcast for today by the way

405
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,880
a lot of people talking about the name podcast where that came from I can't remember who it was

406
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,520
that that that registered podcast dot com so that's the the guy that probably came with it first

407
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,360
Dave slushle remember because he saw it in his refer logs but I'm not actually doing a podcast here

408
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,880
you know I'm doing a podcast you you you must have misunderstood me all right so I said hi to a

409
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,240
dawn of the dawn of drew shade the show yesterday on the source code because he's talking about me

410
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,080
and well they played the clip on their own show and here's a dawn's response

411
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,160
he told me put on this sexy voice the directory yeah he got a quiet because he doesn't want

412
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:33,520
his wife to hear Adam Curry you're so busted you're right if my wife actually what I was

413
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,880
doing now yeah quite honestly her sister listens and then calls her up and tells her what I said

414
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,200
wait so I'm in love with Adam Curry that's what he says he's out at me he doesn't know if that's

415
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,200
gonna cause me to get divorced then I'll have to move with him we could get divorced on the show

416
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,720
because of that tune in next time to find out what happens in the continuing saga of dawn to

417
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:07,520
an Adam whoa something's really funky about my setup today home on a second there we go

418
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:16,720
is it still recording uh that's hard to tell yeah it is oh man this is just not my day okay let's

419
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,720
move along now so that was a bit from dawn and drew here's something really cool that came in on

420
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,240
the portalette podcast now it's a Brian who who does the show he told me that he had to work

421
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,080
as office and he was using a Mac G4Q I have one of those at the office in Amsterdam I love the

422
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,600
machine but indeed it's a lot sorely lacking internal microphone or even a lining put so he'd

423
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,040
have to use a griffin eye mic or some other USB device but he came up with a whole different concept

424
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,240
and I'd never and I don't know if he was doing this on a Mac or if he was using the natural

425
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,760
voices from AT&T I mean I gotta have this whoever put this out I hope it works on a Mac

426
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,680
listen to the quality of this text to speech in the recent portalette podcast

427
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,240
it's October 14th 2004 and this is the portalette podcast Brian had to work late tonight so

428
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,920
he has asked me his computer to fill in for him you'll have to forgive me this is my first time

429
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,360
so I'm not exactly sure what to do now do you hear this I mean I've heard a lot of text to

430
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,400
speech synthesis but this is really good I mean this is like an actual voice yeah it's a little

431
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,680
burpy here in there but it's not hard to parse at all why don't I just start off with a little news

432
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,440
and updates the podcast seems to be going well he has been getting a lot of email from people all

433
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,640
over the place he asked me to respond to the guy who asked about the mixer he's using

434
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,360
it's a six channel and it's made by Samsung now here's what's cool is he has other voices

435
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,960
even with accents and he puts those in and then when they talk together it's it's crazy

436
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,480
hey everybody look who's here it's Mark Stingpet Alfonso don't any chicks right in

437
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,480
unfortunately no what are you doing I'm podcasting what's that it's like blogging

438
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:19,440
but only with audio that's sad real sad I know I like to better when he was down here late

439
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:27,120
doing what it's word or what you got in your browser cash just a bunch of mp3 files now

440
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,080
man this pop casting sounds like bush it

441
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,240
then I got a woman in there and an English guy and it's great I really love it and I

442
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,000
I wouldn't mind listening to an audio book that way if you could put if you have if you have a

443
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,480
novel and you put in uh different voices with different characters I think it would work so I

444
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,800
got to find out what that is that's excellent stuff I hope it's not windows only because I really like

445
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,320
it and then another uh whacked out idea that I that I received from Andrew Woolridge

446
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,800
um see uh I'll just read his email to you so if you listen to your podcast on my laptop while

447
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,880
writing home on the train here at San Francisco very cool had a minor brainstorm regarding regarding

448
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,720
podcasting wanted to relate to you what if you combine podcasting with geocaching mean imagine if

449
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,240
you were going to a certain location in your geocache say to the top of a hill overlooking a nice ocean

450
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,880
before you left you went to podcasting.org or something and downloaded all the comments stories or

451
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,960
whatever you have about the location then when you got there you could listen to all the stories or

452
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,760
impressions of all the people who had visited that location so I think what he's saying here and this

453
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,520
sounds really cool is to create a podcast feed based on geographic location so indeed you could have

454
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,040
a database and these already exist it look into geocaching people are way into handheld GPS devices

455
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,040
and doing treasure hunts and uh and uh even walking tours you know so you can get uh points of interest

456
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,040
and where to walk and little pop up and tell you you know what's interesting about that particular

457
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,640
particular point imagine leaving you know like comments in midair so if if you are on a certain

458
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:12,320
bridge in Amsterdam um that well let's just really imagine fast forward right and there would be a

459
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,760
feed for that particular geographic location or anything within uh you know within a 20 meter radius

460
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,200
and you could download that and and it would put on your iPod or maybe it would you download an

461
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,760
entire walking tour and once you hit a certain location it would give you the files I mean I just like

462
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,680
the idea of having space being trackable where you are and I always love the the museum tours

463
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,360
remember those are kids and you put in the earphones the Smithsonian probably still has it

464
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,520
or they have updated versions shit they had one at the uh uh uh and Pompeii they had an audio

465
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,800
walking tour um you know just think of all the the possibilities of that I think it's uh pretty

466
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,560
outrageous okay one more bit that I want to play from the Engaget podcast uh these guys are really

467
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,080
on fire they're already at a you know fantastic community with uh Engaget.com and they do a uh

468
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,720
I guess mom maybe a twice a week podcast now and Len it's Lenin Phil who are on the show is

469
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,240
doing something pretty exciting and upcoming a Riley conference. So speaking of a Riley and good

470
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,040
folks over there um something cool came up the other day through you and I um where they're looking

471
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:30,080
for some cool sessions to do at their macOS 10 conference that's happening um the week of the 20

472
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,920
year fifth I think it's the 25th through the 28th and um turns out they were looking to do a session

473
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,960
on podcasting and they came to the good current and gadget and um I'm gonna do the sessions.

474
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,400
Yep so it's pretty cool I'm gonna do a session about podcasting everything about it how to

475
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,520
consume how to create and how to distribute podcasts and uh we're gonna talk about how to do it on

476
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,280
the mac we're gonna talk a little bit about how to do it on the PC so um should be pretty cool if

477
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,960
anyone's listening it's going to the conference pop up and tell us how we're doing. Yeah I uh I

478
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,800
think it'll be interesting I can't make it because it's my anniversary and the last year I was in

479
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:16,640
China and I got forgiven for that because I was literally China um yeah dude dude dude it's okay

480
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,000
it's okay we understand you don't have to go anniversary totally get it rocked the situation

481
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,560
so um look forward to that and I think only appropriate now to say of course that November 6
