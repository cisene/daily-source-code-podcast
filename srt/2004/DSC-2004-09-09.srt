00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's the Daily Source Code! Good afternoon from Curry Castle in Belgium!

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I discovered yesterday although a little bit too late that I had lowered my mic volume

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
instead of the opening tune, the Rachmaninoff-Burris remix.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Anyway, today is September, what is it?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
September 9th, 2004.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm Adam Curry.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the source code available at DailySourceCode.com and via subscription with RSS 2.0 enclosures

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
at DailySourceCode.com slash RSS.XML.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is the place where users and developers party together and great news, we have a logo.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thanks to Jaco van at skipintro.nl.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I actually worked with Jaco a couple of years ago when we were doing the jammedy stuff at

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Amsterdam and he now has his office right at the backside of the garage where I parked

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
my car whenever I'm in Amsterdam.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He actually had to walk to the garage to get to their office which I've never been to unfortunately.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I cooked up a daily source code logo, a little animated GIF, and I'm really happy with it,

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
so thank you very much, Jaco.

18
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
And a technical mistake that I made yesterday, I really messed up.

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I was talking about Murphy's Law and how Murphy struck on the Genesis probe that went

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
to collect dust from the sun or dust particles.

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
So it wasn't two helicopters that had a net struck between them.

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
By the way, that was the way it was reported here in the press in the Netherlands.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
But it was one helicopter, maybe they had a backup helicopter flying around as well.

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:10,500
It was supposed to catch the Genesis, well, let's just call it a disk, by its parachute

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
and with a grappling hook, which seems like a real tough maneuver to me.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
But anyway, they didn't get to try it out for real, unfortunately.

27
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
And I do hope that there's something left of the experiments that they did and they'll

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
be able to use some of the data.

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I want to talk briefly today about Skype.

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
I know I've talked about it before, but this program is so beautiful.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And it's really just boggling my mind, particularly the more I look into voice over IP and what's

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
available now and what's inevitably coming in the very near future.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So first of all, I don't know if Skype seems to be a pretty closed environment and I don't

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
know if anyone can let me know if this works the same as SIP, which is what seems to be

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a standard that's out there amongst voice over IP providers.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not really, not, but what are they doing?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What is the peer-to-peer part of Skype that is so important that gives it an advantage

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
over using the SIP protocol?

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't see any from a user's perspective and it may not make any difference the way

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
telephony is working right now in voice over IP.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It could of course change with some of the services, but if you have any idea please

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
let me know at adamantcurry.com.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I'm still looking for a voice over IP provider and a lot of people sent me different

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
links, most of the stuff I'd already...

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,500
you've found is one actually in the Netherlands called Rits Taylor-Kolm who almost offer what

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm looking for but I'll just go through one more time and maybe you can help me out.

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I'm looking for a provider.

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,500
It doesn't matter where the provider is located, as long as I can get a local dial-up line,

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,500
so my own dedicated number in the Netherlands, that could be anywhere, preferably Amsterdam,

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
in Belgium, which is, that's only optional since we'll only be here for a couple more

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
months and definitely one or two in the States.

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I'd love to have a California number and a New York number.

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,500
That way I can call just about anybody I want and they can also call me at the very low

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,500
cost of voice over IP because all the pricing seems to be more or less the same.

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Interestingly enough, each country has its own specific rates for the mobile telephony in

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
that country.

57
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,500
So if I want to call Amsterdam via Skype, for instance, it doesn't matter where I'm

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,500
calling from, of course, since I'm doing that over the internet, then it winds up costing

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
me to a landline in Amsterdam I think four cents a minute and if I call a mobile phone

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
it all of a sudden it bops up to like thirty seven cents a minute.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then again a mobile phone in Belgium is cheaper.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So there's all different rates going on in the mobile industry for sure.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But again that's all I'm looking for a voice over IP provider that can give me that and

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I guess I'd want to have a SIP compatible provider and I'm only presuming that SIP

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
works just as well as Skype if it doesn't then I'll wait until Skype gets more

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
of their services together because it blows me away.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Every single time I call someone I'm calling people now from Skype exclusively

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because it's just cheaper and actually people comment on the quality they say

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
it sounds much better I got my headphones on it works and I'm in front of the

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
computer anyway usually when I'm on the phone looking at stuff for reference

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
material when I'm talking to someone so it's perfect just would like to see if I

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
can do even better by getting local over.

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,500
local dial-up numbers in the states and in the Netherlands and in Belgium as well, if it all possible.

74
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Now, on to iPodder. First of all, my apologies to Dave Slusher.

75
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I had commented and I'd given some feedback on the Get-Enclosures Perl script iPodder.

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500
You can find all of these different versions of iPodder. They're all designed to do the same

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
thing to bring in content into your iPodder or other mobile mp3 player.

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
So I've been using his script instead of my own Apple script and I'd said that I'm getting all

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,500
kinds of duplicates and all kinds of crap flying around and the problem was that I had incorrectly

80
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,500
entered my cron job. So I had the hour right and I told you to run it only these hours,

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,500
run it on any day and so I thought I'd done all the entries right except at the very beginning

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
you have to also specify a minute otherwise it's going to run every single minute.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
for that entire hour that you specified and that's why I was getting all these duplicates and everything was freaking out.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So it was totally my fault and I apologize for any implications that the script was buggy because it's not. Now it's working perfectly.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But here's another great example. I mean the fact that I even know what a cron job is puts me way ahead of any user that you can think of in the stuff, the people we're making this stuff for.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And we need to hide that and I don't mean hide it as much as we don't want to tell anyone what we're doing but we need to mask and just set it up in a much easier fashion.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So on that very first run it should say, oh okay I'm going to install this and it's going to run every night at 1am and every morning at 6am.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is this okay? And you can say yes for the defaults or you could specify maybe a couple different hours.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Maybe just with checkboxes. Doesn't have to be anything super big.

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Another script that has been released, another iPodder script which is now also on the download directory on ipodder.org is PyPodder.

91
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,500
And I tried this one out. I like it very much.

92
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,500
The best part about it, I guess, is you don't have to download any other additional software.

93
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
If you have Python running on your machine, and just about every computer these days,

94
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,500
I think maybe Windows even comes pre-installed with Python.

95
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I believe my Mac came with it pre-installed, but if not, it's very simple.

96
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
You can get Mac Python, you download and you install that once.

97
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
But again, that's where the install process should check.

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Is Python in the environment if not download and install?

99
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Then Pipotter goes on to actually do a little bit of installation for you.

100
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,500
It creates a folder on the Mac that is in your library folder

101
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,500
and puts all of the feeds into a feed file.

102
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,500
That's a little bit hard to find. If you want to adjust the feeds or remove a feed or add one,

103
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
you have to kind of go hunting.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
for that feed file, so that's something that could be presented a little bit better to

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the user.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Additionally, it's kind of a shame that the downloads before they're added to the iTunes

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
playlist that they're all crammed into one directory called Pipodder in your iTunes music

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
directory or in the music directory of your hard drive, which is a shame because I really

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
like folders being created with the name of the channel that the downloads came from.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But otherwise, a great script, really efficient, and it's up on the download directory now as well.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Excellent.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I got some comments on the bit we were talking about yesterday about radio.

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How MSN Radio is copying terrestrial radio broadcast stations formats and trying to,

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
you know, I'm trying to present a clutter free quote unquote radio station with the same music.

115
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:48,500
mix, well, I saw an email, actually I saw a track back from Peter Rucavina and I posted

116
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
to that.

117
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
And he says, you know, my main problem is I have no drive time.

118
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,500
He has no commute or very little commute and therefore he feels that he can't catch

119
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,500
up on some of the programs and audio blog posts that he would like to.

120
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,500
But as he astutely points out, you know, there is some television he could spend

121
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
little less time watching since it's really just not worth it.

122
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I don't know, you have to make those choices yourself.

123
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
That's your own priorities.

124
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
But yeah, of course, you know, if we're shooting for drive time people were, you know,

125
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
we're going to miss out on other people.

126
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,500
But I'm sure that, you know, if the shows are compelling enough, people will find time

127
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
to listen to them.

128
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Admittedly, I'm even having a little more trouble since I don't have that daily commute

129
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
an hour and six minutes up and an hour and a half back.

130
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
So I'm missing out.

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
finding it harder to catch stuff on the first day, I definitely have to plan and say, okay,

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm going to go out and work out and do some exercises, walk around and then I'll listen

133
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
to whatever I have queued up.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But also some of the stuff that came down in the past two days wasn't particularly that

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
interesting.

136
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Two IT conversations that I didn't care to care for that much.

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, that was an interesting legal terminology in there.

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But it didn't catch me this time around.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And see Halley Suit had Bob Metcalf inventor of Ethernet on memory lane.

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't care about that.

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I've just been given a glass of orange juice.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hold on.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's eight minutes past one Thursday afternoon and I'm not even dressed yet.

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, that is the life of a guy without a job.

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So yeah, added another feed to the directory on iPodder.org.

146
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's the mix of the week feed.

147
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's an MP3 mixed with new and older tunes all together.

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So if you're into cool mixes, definitely subscribe to that and that will work with

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
iPodder, that feed.

150
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And came across another program because you can't call it an audio blog post

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
through reinvented.net.

152
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a program called Live from the Formosa Tea House.

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I'll just let you hear a little bit of it.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's an interesting format.

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think it's three guys who sat down and had lunch at the Formosa Tea House,

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
apparently.

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And you can hear the kind of the Muse act going in the background.

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And they're just discussing all kinds of general topics, politics, their food.

159
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,500
What is a blog post like this supposed to, how is it supposed to work, what's supposed

160
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
to sound like?

161
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I'll just let you hear a little bit just to get the feel of what they were putting together

162
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
because I think it definitely has potential.

163
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Check this out.

164
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Great, insightful post.

165
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
You'll get one comment and I like that idea.

166
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
We're no comments whatsoever.

167
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Who knows?

168
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Maybe you post on a Sunday.

169
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
You get that post.

170
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
People do things.

171
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,500
I find that the replies, like the reader comments, that they're not going to be a comment.

172
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:06,500
So you probably noticed right off the bat what I noticed the first, when I listened to this,

173
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,500
is it's really hard to hear their voices and so that's a shame but that's just something

174
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
that can be solved with maybe two microphones.

175
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,500
That should be possible on most setups and maybe a little bit of sound processing on the

176
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
recording end.

177
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
It's a lot of stuff that we've got to figure out to make this work but the natural mix

178
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
of the environment, I think they had right on with a little bit of background music going

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
on there.

180
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
And it was a...

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It was kind of fun to listen into what they were talking about.

182
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So you can check that out through reinvented.net.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Something else I came across.

184
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, this is from one of my favorite feeds, which of course is the Blog Digger Media Feed.

185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I heard this, actually I heard it on the radio this morning, bright and early, and

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I was like, wow, that's really good, and I had no idea where it came from.

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I was about to go look for it.

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
When lo and behold, I checked iTunes and it was already sitting right there.

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's a classic, and we'll actually do this as the song of the day for today.

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's a classic from YouTube, although with a new vocalist.

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And the editing on this is just simply amazing.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Check out George W with Sunday Bloody Sunday.

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There's been a lot of talk about this next song.

194
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I can't believe the news today.

195
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I can't close my eyes and make it go away.

196
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Hello! Hello! Let's taste this sauce! Hello! Too, too, too long! Too long!

197
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
We can be as one tonight.

198
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Tonight.

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Tonight.

200
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Broken models of your children's feats.

201
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Body stone across the dead end's feats.

202
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
But it won't need the battle hall.

203
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
It puts my back on the ground.

204
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Sunday, what do you sound?

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Sunday, what do you sound?

206
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Sunday, bloody Sunday

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Sunday, bloody Sunday

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's roll

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And the battle has just begun

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This mini lost in him

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He has won

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The Tracer's War for their hearts

213
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mother's sh**

214
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Thank you so much.

215
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
What's your song, babe?

216
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Hello!

217
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Hello.

218
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Two long.

219
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Two long.

220
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Two long.

221
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Two long.

222
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We can be as one tonight, tonight, tonight.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let's roll this.

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If anyone wants more details, I can if you find them online.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The web address is not very easy to remember.

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Park, park, don't know.

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Walk the tears from your eyes.

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Walk your tears away.

230
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Sunday Bloody Sunday

231
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Sunday Bloody Sunday

232
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Let's go!

233
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
We need a drink while tomorrow at night.

234
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Something like something

235
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Something like something

236
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Next Sunday.

237
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's Sunday!

238
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Brilliant. Not too sure who created this, unfortunately. The metadata only states the artist as Rx and it's from the album The Party Party.

239
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:31,500
It's Sunday Bloody Sunday here on Source Code. Moving along, I got an email in response to my question is where you listen to the source code.

240
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Is it indeed during your commute? Is it at work? Is it at home? Is it while you're working out? Is it in the bathtub?

241
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:46,500
I got one from Hedzers Hotsmann from the Netherlands. He's studying part-time at the Freit Universiteit, the Free University of Amsterdam.

242
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,500
He says what he always does is he always records lectures on his iPod. I guess he's using a Gryphon i-mic or something like that.

243
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:03,500
So that he can review them again and go back and listen to pieces later on if he so wishes.

244
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:14,500
He says a great idea for the iPod would be for either a lecture room or you could do it by course, which would make sense.

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
RSS feed with all of the lectures so that if you couldn't go, if you're sick or if you

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
didn't feel like going, or if you just want to keep a record of it, all you have to do

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is subscribe once to a certain lecture feed and they'll keep flowing in.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So a great use and an excellent idea.

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So it's kind of, yeah, everything's kind of cool around here.

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We're starting to wrap things up.

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We plan to be out of the country by the first of the year or before.

252
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So house hunting in the UK is going to start seriously in about a week or two.

253
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Patricia has one more show she's going to do.

254
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a fashion show and she's designing the makeup and the models.

255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So she's still pretty busy with that.

256
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But then she'll be off to the UK to find us a house.

257
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And so my quest will be besides working on the iPodder and the daily source code and

258
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
whatever other trouble I can get into and trying to make the world a better place.

259
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll be working on my fixed wing license as you know I have a.

260
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I'm a helicopter pilot. I plan on hopefully on my way to blogger con in

261
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
November I hope to go through Florida, Pasadena, Florida

262
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
to do my check ride for my commercial

263
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Pilots license for helicopter and then as I said I want to get my fixed-wing license

264
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
The flying bit is you know the navigation everything is pretty much the same

265
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
But flying a

266
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Regular airplane versus a helicopter there are some definite differences and I need to really build up

267
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Some hours so I feel confident enough because I plan on definitely flying back and forth between

268
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
the mainland and the UK

269
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Pretty regularly certainly for the first year and it's much

270
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,500
It's just much much cheaper to do that with an airplane than with a helicopter helicopter doesn't even go that much slower

271
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:11,500
But it's still it's using a fixed-wing is just much more efficient for that. So I've been looking into

272
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
An interesting category of

273
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Aircraft you know, so what I'm learning on now is it

274
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
like a Cessna 172. It's a very standard airplane. It's like all of your typical little plane

275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
that people fly around on the weekends. But there's a whole new category called VLA,

276
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Very Light Aircraft. And these used to be known as the, I guess it came originally

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
from the ultra lights, which are pretty much like those broomsticks that fly. You just

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
sit on them one after another. But the very lights are, many of them I believe are

279
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
now certified, which means you can land at a regular airport with them, maybe not

280
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
just confined to certain hobbyist airfields. And some of them are just

281
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
absolutely stunningly beautiful. I think it was the velocity that I saw that has

282
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
a canard wing that's a small wing in the front of the nose. Canard meaning

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
duck, so it has kind of a duck bill, which has all kinds of safety advantages.

284
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You can't, it's almost impossible to pull it into a stall because the first wing

285
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
will stall.

286
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:28,500
all before the main wings. But anyway, I mean gull wing doors, seats, four or five, attractable

287
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,500
landing gear. Now you're supposed to build them yourself because these are kits. But

288
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm pretty sure you can work something out where you get it pretty much pre-built. But

289
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,500
they're really efficient, they're very fast and they're just looking really, really

290
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,500
good. Great machines. Tony, if you have any suggestions about excellent

291
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:59,500
DLAs for going back and forth from the UK to the mainland, let me know. And I want to

292
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,500
wind it up today. Inevitably, we're almost at the eve of 9-11. Today is the

293
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
ninth. You may be listening to this on the 10th or the 11th itself. So there's

294
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,500
all kinds of media attention surrounding the anniversary of

295
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,500
this tragic event. And Dave pointed out something on American radio works.

296
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
which is a special they did called Witnesses to Terror.

297
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And that's something you should check out. It's available on real audio only as far as I could tell.

298
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What I like about it, and I'll play a little bit for you here. I think I have a bit cued up with some of the real audio footage as it were,

299
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is they do have a lot of the calls between the control centers and, you know, the questions.

300
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Hey, do we need to scramble planes? Well, who's going to make that call?

301
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's really a fascinating radio documentary. Listen to a little piece of it.

302
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay, so immediately we go into buffering mode. This is one problem I've noticed.

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's very hard to get a free feed from them.

304
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Presumably because it's really good and a lot of people are hammering their server,

305
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
but they may have a little light load. Oops. Well, that actually just crashed my real player.

306
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay, well, you go listen to it for your-

307
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
yourself, AmericanRadioWorks.publicRadio.org.

308
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Well worth it.

309
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Excellent document.

310
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Not that it's going to change your mind about anything.

311
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
It doesn't go in any conspiracy theories,

312
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
but it does give a whole new angle

313
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
to the events that unfolded that day

314
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
that you probably haven't seen or certainly

315
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
haven't heard before.

316
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,500
With that, 23 or 24 minutes almost, time to wrap it up.

317
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
So if you have any comments on the source code for today,

318
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
just send me an email.

319
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
