00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code, neither sleep, snow, rain or transcendental move can stop us from bringing your source code every single day.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hi, it's Adam Curry coming to you from Flanders Bells, you're from Curry Castle.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And boy, I gotta tell you, actually it's not really even the Curry Castle anymore, it's just one big empty room, one big space, everything is out.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, actually just about everything is out except for two cats, two dogs, Christina and myself, and we have one bed, we have one small portable television.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And let's see, we have two laptops, yeah, how could I forget?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm on the trusty power book and Christina is on my old Windows laptop, which she loves.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is the source code, today is Tuesday, it's November 16th, 2004, we're right in the middle of our international move to the United Kingdom and still love to bring you a source code.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The movers are out, the trucks are gone, they've actually loaded up even my car, got loaded up under one of the, into one of the container trucks and they're on their way to the UK now Patricia and her sister Ivan.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They probably are already in England right now, they're probably on their way to the hotel.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And so the point is that Christina and I are holding down the fort here for a couple more days.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Actually, just to give you an idea of what it sounds like, I'll just walk into the, so this is still the bar and now, now listen to this echo.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now, you know, some people pay lots of money in studios to get an echo like this.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hello.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I have the fire on, that's about the only thing you know, listen into our fireplace here.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ooh, get that.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wow, it's hot too. Let me just throw another log on real quick.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So basically it's just a big ass empty house, Christina and I staying in the same queen size bed I might add tonight and also tomorrow night and then Thursday we actually will be taken off as well.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And so as I said, the only thing left standing is a couple of teacups, one ass tray, you know, that's for.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And since they toured on the big max setup, I pulled out the windows laptop, the via laptop.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Christina has been bugging me for years to get windows. Now, what do you think?

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now that your own windows, you love it, really? You're hurting me, you're hurting your dad by saying this.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Really, you love windows? What is it about windows that you like so much?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The MSN.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The MSN, because everyone else has cool MSN.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And the being able to watch videos about being ripped off because I don't have a new version of the windows media player.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, you couldn't watch videos because they would only play on windows media players.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So who's who's ripping who off?

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Exactly, just wanted to hear you say.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't care if you use a shit as long as you got your priorities straight there.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
All righty, so a lot to do, a lot to talk about today, I'm going to show you.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't even have any music for today, but that's partially because I just didn't have time to, you know, to peruse around to find stuff and haven't really been listening.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, I've been listening to some podcasts, obviously, what we've been moving, but haven't really been listening to any music per se.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So nothing really queued up for you for today's show.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've been meaning to talk for quite a while now about the whole week radio show.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Show comes from Alaska.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you've never heard it, subscribe to it from the iPodor.org directory.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Also on the show notes now, I'm working on building up a some kind of production system.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm now going to add into the show notes, the directory note from, or the actual link to the podcast that I'll take from the director.

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Does that make any sense? So basically, there's going to be an HTML page, which will show all the stuff, but what's really cool is there's also going to be an OPL mill version.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So that, well, somehow we're going to have to figure out, I don't know, I got to talk to, you know, I should post something on the iPodor developer list actually, because it makes sense that,

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
we're already pulling in directory stuff in OPL. It's such a beautiful format, and particularly for production notes,

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
they may be a way for, you know, for you just to make some kind of OPL file available, which is real simple.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not line or copy and paste stuff, you know, it's don't have to do a lot of work, but then the iPodor software,

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
maybe they could render that and do something cool with it. Anyway, back to a whole week radio.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been meaning to play a little bit from a whole week radio, and these are, they've got a such an excellent setup.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I don't know what it looks like, and I've never purposely never visited their website.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, I have briefly, but I, because I have such a imaginary thought of, you know, where Jim Bob is sitting, and where Esther is sitting,

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and what the weed hole is, and you know, is he really stringing a microphone down through the weed hole,

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and he's got this cool setup, because apparently a lot of people listen to him do the show live as he's streaming it, and of course, now they're also podcasting.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And they can leave comments in a chat room, and then, but that's a synthesized voice that also pops up between Jim Bob and Esther talking.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's pretty freaky, but once you're into it, you kind of, you kind of get addicted to it, that there's this third voice,

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
which is out there, which is controlled by the listeners.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So just a little bit, because there's nothing quite as cool as listening to a husband and wife fights on podcast, you know,

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
having quite gotten Michael Butler's whole thing recorded yet, but, and I'm sure the Patricia and I will have a good spat to record on one of these podcasts,

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but this is not really a fight, but Jim Bob and Esther, with actually this was a short, I think it was a promo of a whole wheat radio.

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm just going to play a little bit of it, so get an idea of what they're about, you like it.

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He doesn't let me kiss him on the lips, it's just the cheek.

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here, you want to, you want to taste something?

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No, don't ask off.

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's steaming.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We're having a fire, I don't know.

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't like phrases like shoes off zone.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When did the world turn so friggin' new agey and yeah, shoes off zone?

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Just say take your damn boots off.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't do anything.

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I leaked because I pulled out early.

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, right on.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I pulled the pot out, so I could get a cup of coffee in it.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, so you get the idea of Jim Bob and Esther, a whole wheat radio, which reminds me there's,

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and I've been listening to George Carlin audiobook, there's another piece in there.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's talking about euphemisms throughout the whole book, Marty, about halfway through.

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And so audiobook, I'll be sure to play some of that in source codes to come in the next week or so.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
God, when he goes through his euphemisms, just like, you know, Jim Bob kind of did, you know.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's like shoes off zone.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What happened to take your damn boots off, George Carlin just does a wicked euphemism piece,

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
which as I said, I'll get to you here on the source code.

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And a message from our friends over at Indyfeet.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, this is Chris McDonald over at Indyfeet.

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Just wanted to get in touch with you.

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And, you know, I'm really pumped about all this great talk and promotion for independent acts.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And certainly appreciate you mentioning what we're doing.

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In your recent shows, you had mentioned how it made sense to start getting some of the more popular songs

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that people were requesting and getting them on heavy rotation.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And so what we're going to be doing over at Indyfeet is we're going to take the songs that we hear.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And anything that's kind of consistently being played, we're going to make sure we get those feeds

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and have them archived and available for anyone who wants to check them out.

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If they want to just check out the music alone, after they hear the good stuff that you're promoting there,

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
they can always go over here as well.

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So just want to let you know that.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And to kick things off, we contacted Brad over at Brad sucks.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I'm happy to say that we've got dirt bag up and running and available for people to listen to.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That particular song can be found at the Alternative and Modern Rock channel.

93
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, okay, thanks a lot.

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And we really appreciate what you're doing.

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And if there's anything we can do to help, just let us know.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
All right, talk to you later.

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, right, I'm Chris.

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Chris McDonald there from Indyfeeds.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And it's good to hear that our our buddy Brad sucks is on the Indyfeeds.

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's getting some airplane.

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Looks like something's happening here.

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now I've played him three times in as many podcasts.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I'm going to lay off Brad for one day.

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But definitely check it out and Indyfeeds because it's a great way to catch new music.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And it's funny actually that I do subscribe to all the Indyfeeds.

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But still nothing came in today that I really felt suitable for the show.

107
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sometimes we talk about users and developers partying together.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The source code seems to be kind of an apex for a lot of that nastiness that we do.

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And wouldn't you know that Don and Drew, of course, we all know and love Don and Drew.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, I've been listening to that.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was I went on my bike to get some Chinese takeout for for Christina.

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Not actually my bike.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The only bike that's left here.

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why did money that leave Dennis is bike here Christina?

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You don't know.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sorry.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's ugly.

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's ugly.

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What was the point?

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, I was listening to Don and Drew on the headset as I was biking along.

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And man, I almost fell off a couple times.

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But anyway, Don and Drew came up with something really awesome.

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Which was what is Don call it the double ender.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The double ender means that you basically record a podcast together.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And you may be communicating with each other via telephone, cell phone or perhaps even Skype.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But you each do a recording of your own side of the conversation.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And they did this.

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think their buddy James the invincible set him up for it.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But they did this with two power books.

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, Don was on was in San Francisco.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And Drew was back in Wisconsin.

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And then I guess they emailed the file over.

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And he sinked the two up in Garage Band.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Now, I've been told that this doesn't always work.

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can certainly imagine where it would work with two computers at the same

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
making model.

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because it has something to do with a clock speed.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I'm almost quite certain that you'd have to do it in raw file format like

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AIFF or wave or something.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because the minute you start compressing, if you're using different compressors,

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
then there can be a time lapse that appears which would basically screw it up.

143
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But I haven't done a lot of testing with that.

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's something I do want to do because Dave and I do trade secrets.

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We do trade secrets.

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We do it through Skype technology.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Which I read somewhere else.

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If someone says shoot me an email saying that the Mac version of Skype is coming

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and that it will have separate in and outputs.

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, anyway, we'll look out for that.

151
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But when you get users doing stuff like that, the developers in our

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
little community here of iPod or nuts take note.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And they really take note.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then they do something about it.

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And they try to figure stuff out and try to make stuff for it.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Here's proof that users and developers party together.

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Listen to some of the iPod or lemon team.

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hello.

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Hello.

160
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Good night.

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is Andrew Grummit.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Matthew Bishop and I'm Goth.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And we are conferencing in over Skype and doing a little test to see if we

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
can record this conference call.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Which would be fascinating if we had anything to talk about.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We have no agenda whatsoever.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Just testing the recording time.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Really.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's just completely a test.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But yeah.

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Absolutely.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, right?

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Basically.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, we're on about boring ship.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Basically, Andrew got this idea because he was listening to the

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don Drew Show.

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So you could tell that story, Andrew.

178
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, yeah.

179
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So I think a bunch of other people noticed this too.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But Don and Drew did a remote podcast where Drew was in Wisconsin and

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don was in California.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We were just, you know, we've been listening to trade secrets and we're just kind of

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
blown away with the quality, the sound quality, if they're recording.

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And so scratch in our heads wondering how they did it.

185
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So of course, Drew wrote it all up.

186
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it's actually a pre-standard technique apparently.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It is a name.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's called doing a double ender.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But anyway.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, there's a triple ender.

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, yeah.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There you go.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's very dope.

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Nice.

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So we thought we'd give it a shot.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And so we are.

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And dating.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But of course, you were the evil genius.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So you'd figured out what he was doing as you were listening, right?

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Not as I was listening.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I actually figured it out on the way to work today.

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I just had one of those moments where, of course, you know, everyone's a

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
genius in their own mind.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So I thought, ah, I know what they're doing.

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I went back and I thought,

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You need to go wrong channel off.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No, no, no, no, no wrong channel off.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That bastard.

210
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's what he was doing.

211
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Drew, you exactly.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Mother.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Whatever.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So I think what we're going to do now is we're all going to hang up.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And we're going to send our files around and try to mix them all back together

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and audacity.

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Which is a great chance.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But is anyone actually going to bother publishing this?

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Or we're just going to use it to convince ourselves that we're freaking

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
geniuses.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I might play it on the podcast.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Bit to bit.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We'll see.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll put the whole thing up.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll put the whole thing up.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're horrible people.

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Um, so have it.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We just stopped the recording and then you want to make it.

231
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
MP3 is this time to have smaller size.

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You think that'll work?

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah.

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, you mean, uh,

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Just damn it.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Damn it.

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Damn it.

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Damn it.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Damn it.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Damn it.

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Damn it.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Damn it.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Damn it.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Damn it.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Damn it.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Damn it.

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Damn it.

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Damn it.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Damn it.

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Damn it.

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, that really sucked because just when you're about to hear,

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
if that, if you could sample it down to MP3 and if you all had to use the same

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
encoder, then they've kind of forgot to give us information.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Um, so I'm presuming that that went right, but I'd like to have some specs on it.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So I'll hunt around, but I'm sure the guys are hearing this.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And let's, let's get some specs out there.

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Particularly, how do you do it on Windows?

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You know, if, if you, how can I set Dave, whiner up so that he can record,

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
um, through audacity or whatever he's using.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Also, you send the mic to Skype, you know, so we don't have to make, uh,

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
uh, an expensive phone call to talk to each other.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And do we both, uh, encoded with, you know, as long as we encoded 64,

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
uh, kilobits per second, um, the stereo or mono.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
As long as we had the same, same sandwich, we'll that work,

265
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
or do we have to have the same software to do it.

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Um, looking forward to some answers there because the quality is great.

267
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I guess someone may be Matthew Bischoff had, uh, had a speaker to close to him

268
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to a mic because there was some echoing going on there.

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But it, in general, that really sounded good.

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And, uh, I wanted to sound that way too.

271
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
A while back, we got, um, future tents from, uh,

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
uh, Minnesota, Minneapolis Public Radio,

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
you know, Minneapolis, I think it's, meaning Minnesota.

274
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, one of the other, MPR, the M stands from Minnesota or

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Minneapolis Public, I think it's Minnesota Public Radio.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Um, their podcasting now with the show, whoops.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What happened there?

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That just sounded really weird.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Did I, uh, hello?

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Did we all have a sudden show up on the internal speaker?

281
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What's this? This is weird.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hold on a second.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We find out what happened there.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't go away, everybody.

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hello?

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay. Well, that was totally weird.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
All of a sudden, it just jumped off of the line input

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
into, uh, into the internal, internal microphone.

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
By the way, I've got this beautiful, beautiful piece of hardware

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
that I bought, I had to get a new battery.

292
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Um, and I got there 15 minutes.

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, see now I'm doing it again.

294
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What the hell is that? That's really weird.

295
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Hold on, I'm gonna try that.

296
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay, so something is triggering it.

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay, so hopefully it'll be okay at least I can get through my story here.

298
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Um, um, I was at the max store to pick up a battery for my power book

299
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and had this beautiful M audio breakout box

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
for inputs, 10 outputs, fire wire driven.

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's got knobs on the front, two headphone jacks on the front

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and two mic inputs on the front.

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Um, you got software to control.

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The hardware hardware to control the software.

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Once we're in England and we're settled,

306
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm gonna, you know, figure this thing out

307
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and I think this is gonna be beautiful.

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It looks like a great piece of hardware.

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Pretty affordable to only about 150 bucks.

310
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So anyway, back to, uh, future tens.

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Um,

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
story that popped up that I've seen around the blogosphere as well

313
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
as about this new streaming media service from Grokster.

314
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Basically, a company that does, I guess it's kind of like the peer cast

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
if you recall that.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Um, although somewhat different.

317
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Instead of you downloading files from, you know,

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
peers out there that are on the Grokster network,

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I guess what they've done is they've,

320
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
they've kind of tricked it out to say,

321
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
well, you know, you're not really gonna download,

322
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
you know, the stream it.

323
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So you'll just have the kind of like,

324
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
if you click the MP3 on it,

325
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
she there goes again.

326
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's totally weird that this is doing that.

327
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Um, it's, so it's very much,

328
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
uh, analogous to, um, you know,

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
if you click on a quick time or an MP3

330
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and it comes streaming into your browser,

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it'll start playing as it's downloading.

332
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But you'll eventually you'll download it.

333
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So what they're trying to do now is they're trying to

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
circumvent the law by saying,

335
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
oh, it's streaming.

336
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's not download.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Therefore, it's legal.

338
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think this is a very dangerous proposition, uh,

339
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
but, you know, Grokster of course is in so much hot water.

340
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll let you hear a bit of this and I'll stop it

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
a couple of appropriate points because it's pretty interesting.

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I think actually for podcasting,

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
this is very, very good news.

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So here's a bit from future times.

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
A way to share music on the internet

346
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that's apparently legal.

347
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is future tense from American public media.

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm John Gordon.

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Peer to peer company Grokster has been one of the main targets

350
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
of the recording industry's legal campaign to crush downloading.

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But now Grokster is teeming up with a silicon valley startup

352
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to offer a music streaming service in which users can listen to

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but not download and save music.

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Grokster will promote a co-branded service with Mercora.

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Users can search for and listen to music that's located

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
on the computers of other users on the system.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because no downloading is involved, Grokster and Mercora

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
executives believe it is entirely legal.

359
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sreevots Sampot is CEO, president and co-founder of Mercora.

360
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you looked at the radio for the past 75 years,

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
radio was the ultimate discovery medium for new music.

362
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And over the last 20 or so odd years,

363
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
you know, radio's been on the decline as far as

364
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
bringing new music to people's years.

365
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And that's a reason a lot of people will go on a peer-to-peer

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
discovering new music playing with it and then going

367
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
by the CD or getting the digital download.

368
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now unfortunately, the act of downloading is illegal.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So we said, look, why don't we figure out a way by which?

370
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I just got to stop it for one second.

371
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What do you mean the act of downloading is illegal?

372
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I hate it when people make statements like that.

373
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The act of downloading is not illegal.

374
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The act of downloading and distributing copyrighted material,

375
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
perhaps as illegal.

376
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But this guy, he sounds like an IPO statement.

377
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Listen to some more.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Like that you get into the peer.

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But instead of downloading, you provide it as a string.

380
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And streaming is illegal under copyright law.

381
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know.

382
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Shoot.

383
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I hope we got some lawyers out there who can tell me if this guy is right or not.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That doesn't sound right to me.

385
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So what we did was we fired with the copyright office

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and said, look, we're building a radio network

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
where every user on the network will be a channel on our system.

388
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I like that.

389
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's good.

390
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We can steal that line.

391
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's cool.

392
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So let's listen to that.

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What do you say?

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We're building a radio network where every note on the system

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
is a channel.

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I like that.

397
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We learned steal that.

398
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's a good lesson.

399
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The word we did was we fired with the copyright office

400
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and said, look, we're building a radio network

401
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
where every user on the network will be a channel on our system.

402
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Beautiful.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And they will broadcast their collection

404
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
onto the network,

405
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
compliant with copyright law.

406
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And your company is paying a fee to who?

407
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
To this song writers

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and to the people who own the music.

409
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So we, every month, we write a check

410
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
to ask app, BMI and CSAC.

411
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And we write a check to sound exchange.

412
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Remember there are two copyrights in a song.

413
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The underlying works, which is the lyrics.

414
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And then the sound.

415
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And what copyright law or the DMCA

416
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
allows people to do his webcasts

417
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
without having to go get individual permission

418
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
from each and every one of the recording artists?

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
One thing that raises eyebrows

420
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
is your new association with Grokster.

421
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay, so then you should listen to this,

422
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
this show and subscribe to it

423
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
from theipotter.org directory

424
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
because they go into a little more depth about that.

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But I think this is really good.

426
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
First of all, these guys are recognizing

427
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
that the radio has yet to be challenged

428
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
in any arena of new media,

429
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
except for satellite radio.

430
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So that's really good.

431
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And they're recognizing that.

432
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The big mistake they're making

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
is that radio is an untethered medium.

434
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Radio is not something that you do in front of your computer.

435
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So they're mixing the metaphors

436
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and people want to share files.

437
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They want to have a file and download

438
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and have it on their machine.

439
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They don't mind if they share it with other people.

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Another thing he said is,

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
radio for 75 years has been the way

442
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to sample new music.

443
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, but it sounds like he just wants

444
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to sit on the man's dick

445
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and get some more of his music.

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's an expression, I'm sorry.

447
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He just wants to be a part of the man's system

448
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
with podcasting.

449
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And we route around that.

450
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know, we're looking at Brad's sucks.

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We're looking at people who don't have a record deal

452
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
in the traditional sense.

453
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But who will make money eventually

454
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
when they become known?

455
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And it will come through gigs and tours

456
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and then eventually we'll find new and smart ways

457
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
to package new music and get it sold

458
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and people to make money.

459
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm very confident of that.

460
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because we all want to.

461
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't think anyone who's in podcasting

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
now is saying, oh, let me go rip off some artists.

463
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You know, it's really, really, really ashamed

464
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that I can't share memories with you

465
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or vice versa by playing songs that we all know.

466
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But, okay, so we're stuck in that loop for a while.

467
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know, let that process run down below

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and, you know, we'll see if we can break out

469
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
of that adventure.

470
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And the meantime, we've got a lot of building

471
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
to do on our own stuff.

472
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So, and I think that this, this grokster thing

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
is probably going to get a lot of attention.

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's going to get a lot of legal attention

475
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
because it's clear that not saying, oh,

476
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
this is really want this.

477
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Users really want to stream audio.

478
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No.

479
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They're saying, this is a way around the legal problem

480
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that the grokster has been having

481
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and that Napster basically put Napster to bed

482
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
or, you know, got a lot of people in a lot of trouble

483
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and cost a lot of people a lot of money

484
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
because a lot of record companies will not a lot.

485
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
A small amount of big record companies

486
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
were suing a lot of people and still do.

487
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So, I think that'll distract from what we're doing

488
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
as long as we try and keep it clean

489
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
trying to stay away from the RIA stuff.

490
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We're pretty good.

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And let them take care of some heat for a while.

492
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And then once we're ready to rise up to the top

493
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and really get in people's faces with

494
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
something that's even easier as it already is

495
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
in today's iPod or World War.

496
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then we're going to blow the lid off this fucker.

497
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I was attended by a comment on my weblog

498
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
that NPR is doing a series about, actually,

499
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
this series is titled Europe,

500
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
New Front Line.

501
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And they start off the series with the Netherlands.

502
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I've been keeping up the speed on some of what's been going on here.

503
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it's an excellent, excellent, short feature.

504
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Everything that I heard and it sounded true from my experience

505
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
as what I witnessed happening here

506
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
with the recent murder of Teo Fancroch

507
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and two years ago, Pinfortan.

508
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And a general feeling of what's happening in the Netherlands.

509
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And you should pay attention to this

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
because there is a lot going on in Europe right now.

511
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So I'm going to play a bit of this

512
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
with the, you know, I've got some on the street interviews

513
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
of just some stuff that I think is worthy listening to.

514
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So again, this is from NPR.

515
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I've put a comment to it in the production notes

516
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
because it's not a podcast, but it isn't.

517
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Actually, it's a stream.

518
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I recorded the idea.

519
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I ripped the stream and made it into MP3

520
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
so I could play it on the show.

521
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So I'll put that link in.

522
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Listen just a bit now.

523
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
NPR again.

524
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Europe, Islam's New Front Line.

525
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is about the Netherlands.

526
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
This is all things considered from NPR News.

527
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm aless of luck.

528
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And I'm Robert Siegel.

529
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Europe is emerging as an arena in the struggle to define Islam.

530
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
With large and growing Muslim populations, France, Germany, Britain, Italy and the Netherlands

531
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
have been caught up in the debate.

532
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Today we begin a series of reports from those countries

533
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and we start in the Netherlands.

534
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
With a murder of a filmmaker this month

535
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
revealed a deep mistrust between Muslims and traditional Dutch society.

536
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
NPR Sylvia Pajoli reports from Amsterdam.

537
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Hours after filmmaker Theo Van Gogh was killed

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
thousands of people gathered to mourn and protest.

539
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The murder has traumatized a society that long-pited itself on its liberalism,

540
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
raising questions about the limits of tolerance,

541
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and its widened misunderstandings between ethnic Dutch and Muslims over cultural values and social norms.

542
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
In the last two weeks, nearly a dozen mosques and churches have been attacked

543
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
in a wave of religiously motivated reprisals.

544
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Van Gogh was repeatedly shot and stabbed by Mohammed Bouyadi,

545
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
a 26-year-old Dutch Moroccan who slit his victims throat

546
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and left a note stabbed into the body,

547
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
warning that enemies of Islam should fear for their lives.

548
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Now let me tell you something.

549
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That is some fucked up shit.

550
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And what's interesting is that through all throughout the Dutch media

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and this will tell you a little bit about Dutch media,

552
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
they have not identified the assailant, the murderer, who they caught.

553
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They caught the guy.

554
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
He shot a cop off his motorcycle, shot another cop in his leg.

555
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
He shot a bystander.

556
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It was an automatic weapon, so it's just spraying bullets.

557
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He literally did slit Theo's throat

558
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and then pinned a note to his chest with another knife.

559
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It was absolutely the think of the horror of all this.

560
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Hold on, I just lost my train of thought there for a second.

561
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Anyway, you need to listen to this show.

562
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Let me just back it up and see what was the piece that I wanted to say.

563
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's messed up.

564
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's why it's just totally messed up.

565
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And keep your eye on Europe because,

566
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
that's what I was going to say.

567
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm sorry, it just had some images of what just happened.

568
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The assailant, the murderer, has not been identified

569
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
by his full last name in any media.

570
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They call him Muhammad B.

571
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's what they do with criminals here in the Netherlands.

572
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Until they are proven guilty, they do not identify them.

573
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's kind of wacky the way they do that.

574
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And what's even more fucked up about it is that you take a focus

575
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
from the grave.

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
He's the guy that killed him for ten two years ago.

577
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Now, he was not a Muslim.

578
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
He was a radical greenie, I guess.

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It doesn't matter.

580
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But they consistently call him, he also got caught immediately.

581
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
They call him focus from the fae,

582
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
folk or vendor G.

583
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So abbreviating his last name,

584
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
just with the first letter.

585
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And now, of course, when people talk about him,

586
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
they still talk about him as a focus from the fae

587
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and don't use his full last name.

588
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Which means, basically, the guy never goes down in history.

589
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Truly is being identified for the horrible crime that he committed.

590
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And now, this is happening again.

591
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But you hear MPR.

592
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And I couldn't even catch the name.

593
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It was, I just couldn't hear the name.

594
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
By the way, the guy was, check this out.

595
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
His dad is American.

596
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
His mom is Dutch.

597
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And he's 26 years old.

598
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And he just got into total radical Islam.

599
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
There's radical stuff.

600
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
There's certain things you can't say about Islam

601
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
because then they feel that they have the right to kill you.

602
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The royal they and the royal we.

603
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So listen to that, okay?

604
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And listen to the rest of that story,

605
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
because it's going to tell you a lot about what's happening in the world.

606
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And Europe is not that far away.

607
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh, okay.

608
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So of all the podcasts.

609
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And I have, you know, I have what I call the pod squad.

610
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I'm going to put that list up again.

611
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Basically, it's my subscription list.

612
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
iPod Rex outputs an OPML file.

613
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And I've talked about that enough, so you know what it is.

614
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But essentially, it's just an outline.

615
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And this outline has all of my subscriptions.

616
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And I can share that.

617
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And then, well, the concept of these.

618
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
These OPML files that you can then drag that into your iPod

619
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and you would be subscribed to all of the shows that I subscribe to.

620
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And conversely, if you drag it out,

621
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
you should be able to unsubscribe from all of those shows.

622
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So I could give you a reading list.

623
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You know, a pod squad list.

624
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Or maybe there's something special going on.

625
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There's a special show that's taking place.

626
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I want to give you a file of, you know,

627
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the podcast that will be podcasting from this particular event.

628
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then you could subscribe to that when you're done.

629
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You just drag it out and you unsubscribe.

630
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So there's a lot to be said for that.

631
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And I'm going to add this next podcast to my pod squad list.

632
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Because there's nothing.

633
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Nothing that could have made me happier.

634
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean, really almost nothing in the podcast arena.

635
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Then for a couple of guys to put together

636
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
the UK Aviation Roundup.

637
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And you boys in aircraft carrier right here.

638
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Because this is the Aviation Roundup.

639
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And we're sitting here looking at the Gazil magazine for,

640
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
issued in September.

641
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This is three of 2004.

642
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And there's a couple of stories in here that have taken a fancy,

643
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
the first one, which is probably the idiot of the day,

644
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
is a story about somebody who banged into a fence post

645
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and decided to fly home anyway.

646
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It had what happened without one.

647
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah, interesting story.

648
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Gentlemen has taken off in a pipe or I believe,

649
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
flown to neighboring airfield.

650
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Landed was taxing back to probably the holding area.

651
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And smashed into a fence post.

652
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Continued back to wherever he was instructed to park.

653
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It got out,

654
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
inspected the damage.

655
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Quite obvious visual damage.

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
In fact.

657
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
What have we done?

658
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Some damage.

659
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Some 10 centimeters.

660
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Right near the leading edge of the wing tip.

661
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Had consulted with two other people at the airfield.

662
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
One of which I believe was an X flying aircraft engineer.

663
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And was instructed, you know,

664
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
told basically, do not fly that aircraft anywhere.

665
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
In fact, they were even given an explanation as to some other aircraft

666
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
that had struck a bail and had disintegrated in flight.

667
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And for some reason, the pilot decided that he would fly back

668
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to his home airfield.

669
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, not done.

670
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Not done at all.

671
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I love it.

672
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Listening to guys talking British accents about things

673
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
are not supposed to do an aviation.

674
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This is a podcast that has me written all over it.

675
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And that's just the first minute and a half of this.

676
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This is a nice, what's the total length of this?

677
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is a nine minutes.

678
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And it's for pilots, man.

679
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's great.

680
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And since I'm a pilot and since I'm moving to the UK,

681
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I feel this is a podcast for me.

682
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Thank you very much, guys.

683
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm so happy.

684
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
There's anything I can do.

685
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Just let me know.

686
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Gilmore gang was on over the weekend.

687
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Of course, it came in on Saturday through the iPod.

688
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You know, these guys always record their show on Friday.

689
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You can find it, IT Conversations.com.

690
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And you know, the Gilmore gang.

691
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's Steve Gilmore.

692
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He's like my head cheerleader of podcasting.

693
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And so, of course, he always finagles every single,

694
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't care if some guy leaves no vell.

695
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You know that eventually the show is going to get around a podcasting.

696
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And I pulled two clips from the show.

697
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I've actually recorded these with audio hijack pros.

698
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So I don't have to go searching through the original files

699
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
on my own new MP3s.

700
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
This is the first one.

701
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And Doxero says something really interesting that my ears

702
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
have tricked up when I heard it and talk about this.

703
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, I have to be produced.

704
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And production takes time.

705
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And you have to do show prep.

706
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You have to do your life like we do.

707
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah.

708
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, if it's just an interview like this,

709
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
if it's talk, that's one thing.

710
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But one of the things that I really love about the best podcast out there

711
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
started with atoms with energy.

712
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And gadgets.

713
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Some extent days as well.

714
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Dave's flushers.

715
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
There's Dave Wonder and then Dave's flusher also.

716
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You know, you take snippets with what other people say.

717
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And you have to get a conversation going.

718
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You take, you produce it.

719
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You take, you have these clips.

720
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And you respond to what people say.

721
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I would love.

722
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And I've gone for walks with a podcast.

723
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I wish that I had a, you know,

724
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
that I pot equivalent and, and Apple's probably not going to make one.

725
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So somebody else wants to do this.

726
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Just enough.

727
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, I can just create the clips on the iPod.

728
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And then put them in my own podcast later and go through them and respond

729
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
in a conversational way to one other people said.

730
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The technology is quite there for doing that easily.

731
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You can certainly do it.

732
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You can't keep me out of it in the long run.

733
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But I have to, I have to make it work with work.

734
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I think first and figuring out how to do that.

735
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And when I, is, is an open question.

736
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm guessing it'll happen before Christmas.

737
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But what is actually?

738
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Just in time for Christmas.

739
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So we can market that shit.

740
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay.

741
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
All right.

742
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So what Docs are also saying is there's room for a better iPod.

743
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's what he's saying.

744
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And shit.

745
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah.

746
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
There's room for a better iPod.

747
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Man, I'm getting very frustrated.

748
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And the more people I talk to, who are just,

749
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
just want to receive podcasts.

750
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You know, the same stuff comes back.

751
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's the bookmarking of MP3s, which no players,

752
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
as far as I know, does.

753
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's about just being able to put stuff on there and find it easily.

754
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
When you take your, your stuff mobile,

755
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
not having to set up smart playlists.

756
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Those are great too, you know,

757
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
but you should be, this, the interface on this thing

758
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
should let you do some things.

759
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And, oh, gee, why can't we use our iPods to record a podcast?

760
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So Linux junkies out there, hardware junkies out there.

761
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What can we do, boys and girls?

762
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
There's got to be something we can put together because

763
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
when people like Doc Serals are,

764
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
are screaming for a device that just isn't there.

765
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And Apple is on, on its fourth iteration.

766
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You got to, you know, stop and give pause for a second.

767
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I see that I skipped over two things I want to talk about.

768
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'll get back to that.

769
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Let me then just follow up with one more bit,

770
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
from the Gilmore guy.

771
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I make a money doing what he's doing.

772
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
He's making money doing something else.

773
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
He's about making money.

774
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
He's about making money.

775
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
He's no problem with that.

776
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't think it's something that we can get me back to.

777
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, how do you make money blogging?

778
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And it's not, it's really good to do something else.

779
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You know, why, even, why burden, why burden blogging

780
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
or podcast or anything with doing, having a revenue model in itself?

781
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I, you know, I have a, I think that only goes so far.

782
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

783
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
it's neither of, it's, it's ball all of the above.

784
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know, there are going to be people who are going to make money

785
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
doing this stuff.

786
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They're going to be people who,

787
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
make money because this stuff is overturning the previous

788
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
incarnation and will effectively become, you know,

789
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the new boss, same as the old boss.

790
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's what's happening.

791
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know, there's, there's an emergent,

792
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
you know, network going on here,

793
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and it will be where every note on the grid is a new channel.

794
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We're in a few years and we'll be all talking about this

795
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to you, man.

796
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Why don't we do an experiment?

797
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Why don't we use our own little podcast here,

798
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the Gilmour Gang as a, you know,

799
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
example and go to the audience and say,

800
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
hey, how would you make a business model out of the show?

801
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That is to say, what would you be willing to pay for?

802
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And how would you be willing to pay for it?

803
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, hold on, hold on.

804
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I would be willing to pay for the Gilmour Gang

805
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
if you all did it in your underwear.

806
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But in terms of getting content like this,

807
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
if you think it's valuable.

808
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I mean, if you're willing to pay for it, that's fine.

809
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm not going to go to the audience and ask them

810
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
how we're going to make money on this.

811
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm going to keep that as a closely held secret.

812
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Well, I mean, we're going to make money.

813
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah, yeah, there it is.

814
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Speaking of making money.

815
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You're going to my day job.

816
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I think Dickham steves,

817
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
his great quote, I think it's in this,

818
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and this put like a poll.

819
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's just a rapidly becoming the day job.

820
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And I'm just, I've been waiting for 30 years for this.

821
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, I've been waiting for 30 years for this.

822
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Damn.

823
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That's deep, dude.

824
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
That's heavy shit.

825
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay, how do we make money with all this stuff?

826
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
People are talking about it.

827
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
By the way, I want to correct myself.

828
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I was talking about the religion node

829
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in the ipodder.org directory.

830
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I talked about the godcasters.

831
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That actually is a godcast.org.

832
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I found.

833
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I added two more religious shows, two more podcasts.

834
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And at the time when I was talking about it,

835
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I said, you know, I'm happy when the religious guys show up.

836
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The religious broadcasters.

837
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Because there's one thing.

838
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Those guys know how to do is how to make money.

839
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I got quite a lot of very nice emails

840
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
saying, oh, you know, really sorry.

841
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You took that, that stands because

842
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
we're not about money.

843
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
We're about spreading the gospel spreading the word

844
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
or sharing sermons.

845
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And that was insensitive of me.

846
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I apologize.

847
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And actually, this is a couple of these.

848
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And they're good.

849
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You know, I like that.

850
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You have to know that perhaps one of

851
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
my biggest fantasies is one day

852
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
to be a pod evangelist.

853
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Could I be a pod evangelist?

854
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I guess so.

857
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000

858

860

861

863

864
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000

865
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Pot.

866
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000

867
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000

868

870
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000

871

872

873
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Pot.

874
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Pot.

875
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Pot.

876
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,360
which I check reasonably frequently, and I heard Colin from the BBC on the

877
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,280
my voice mail, and he sounded, he sounded, well it was hard to tell, he's from

878
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Edinburgh, right? And he didn't sound really happy, he said, you know, because you

879
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,080
call me immediately, I'm like, oh man, and what I'm figuring is, I'm in

880
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,640
some shit now because we got the podcast up and we, you know, we did this whole

881
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,280
thing of, you know, kind of playing for them, or playing the BBC, as they were

882
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,280
kind of directing the podcast, and just kind of showing the two different

883
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,640
worlds between Big Media and podcast media, or web logging, whatever. So I, you

884
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,320
know, I was like, oh, I'll call him back in like half an hour, I got some other

885
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,960
calls to make, I just wanted to do with it at that very moment. And so he left a

886
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,640
comment on my weblog with his phone number, and then finally he, he, he, he reached

887
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,440
me, you're not going to believe this. It turns out that of that six or seven hours

888
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,720
shoot that we did in and around the castle, flying helicopters, doing podcasts,

889
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,520
the entire, all the tapes have dropouts on them, and it's unclear exactly what

890
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,200
happened. What Colin says, they probably went through the airport X-ray scanner,

891
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,400
which I don't think in her at these tapes, it's not something that I do, you know,

892
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,800
if I take broadcast tapes, I have them hand checked and pass them around the

893
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,360
machine, never put them through. So apparently there's a dropout, every other

894
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,120
couple of seconds or so, which sounds about right if it were X-ray or something

895
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:37,440
damaged or some magnetic damage. And so all these hours, they sent two people

896
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,560
over, they had a three-man crew, I mean, I cost a lot of money and everything is

897
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:51,640
shit and it's gone and it's useless. So you feel it coming, they want to know

898
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,600
if I can do it again. And I had a talk with Dave about that, because I really

899
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:05,080
want to, I want to promote podcasting. That's clear. Be I wouldn't mind being on BBC

900
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,000
just around the time we move in. So maybe someone will see that and I can use some

901
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,640
of that celebrity star power to get stuff done like get Christine into the

902
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:20,880
right school for the years over. But on the other hand, you know, it's like, God

903
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,200
that's just so totally fucking blows and they would now they want to do it Friday,

904
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,280
so it would be just kind of like half moved in, we'll have a camera crew in the

905
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,440
house, but Trisha's just going to kill me, I haven't even told her that they

906
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,640
want to do it on Friday. And I'm not sure it's actually going to happen, but it

907
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,320
looks like it will happen. What? What are you laughing about?

908
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,600
This one person's supposed to be a book, and then the screen of the game was full

909
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,240
of him, so I was saying, oh, it's not round to see, but we're just like, say, will

910
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,680
the end of this game jump? Okay. Clearly, you had to be in the MSN

911
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:01,520
chat to get it, right? Anyway, so I'll keep you posted on that, but that's

912
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,720
totally freaking bite. What are we at? We're at 43 minutes shoot. I have a

913
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,600
couple more things I just want to get to. Let me see, have a email here about

914
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,360
iPod or ear. This is from Bob, and I post this along with the, with the

915
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,200
production notes, he's pointing me to goodcanns.com, with there's some good

916
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,360
portable, portable headphone reviews, the cost port of pro. Actually, what I've

917
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,080
been using right now, which I picked up the other day at the Mac store is the

918
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,200
Mac alley, MAC, A L L Y. Noise reduction headsets, costs about 40 bucks,

919
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,720
absolutely perfect. They fit snugly over the ears. Now, of course, I have another

920
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,000
problem, so now the inside of the ears aren't hurting, because I'm not wearing

921
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,800
the ear buds, but I haven't earing in my left ear, and now these headphones

922
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,920
are so tight that the post from the earring is not sticking into my head.

923
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,800
Ladies, please, can you give a podcast or some tips about what to do about posts

924
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,000
that are too long on my earring? Because it's hurting. All right, I want to

925
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,360
have time for one more bit of a podcast. I got an email, you know, love this.

926
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,880
This actually started a whole new category in the iPod or org directory.

927
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,160
Yo Hanfar Roy and says, you know, enjoying everything, and he says he taught English

928
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,920
and Spain for seven years and learned Spanish in the process, and what he wants to

929
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,120
do is he wants to create an unconventional audio-based Spanish course.

930
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,800
And so I was like, well, that sounds interesting, but what exactly does that mean?

931
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,400
What is unconventional, yeah, what's the unconventional way to learn a different

932
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,320
foreign language? So he sent me the first podcast, which I'm trying to fire up now,

933
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:58,160
who wants to second-wise. There's not, here comes notes opening.

934
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,240
You'll find out how unconventional it is as we get into it, and you can subscribe to this.

935
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,800
It's now in the iPod.org directory, so you can actually learn a foreign language in an

936
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,240
unconventional way during your daily commute. Let's listen to how to really learn Spanish.

937
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:25,920
Hi, this is Yo Hanfar Roy and welcoming you to the first installment of How To Really Learn Spanish.

938
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,120
This series of podcasts is aimed at helping you in your own efforts to learn Spanish.

939
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,280
I spent seven years living in Spain where I taught English as my day job.

940
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,320
As you can imagine, that was a wonderful opportunity for me to learn Spanish,

941
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,120
and it really helped me to pinpoint the differences between the two languages.

942
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,440
I'm assuming you're already learning Spanish, whether you're at a beginner,

943
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,680
intermediate, or advanced stage, and I'm here to help you with your doubts,

944
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,000
stay in the right direction, and explain aspects of the language to you in ways which you're

945
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,400
unlikely to find in books or other conventional sources. Dig that. At that time, I'm going to

946
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,400
keep each podcast short about 10 minutes. Today we're going to look at a specific issue in Spanish

947
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,760
pronunciation, and then move on to a couple of techniques to help you with your learning in general.

948
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,080
Okay, so just about this time or you're about ready to go,

949
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,200
you know, I really don't care about the freaking technique. Now check out what my man is doing.

950
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,440
And one mainly aims at tuning your ear and helping you with your pronunciation,

951
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,280
and the other primarily aimed at vastly increasing your vocabulary.

952
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,000
Finally, we're going to look at one little item aimed specifically at beginners.

953
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,200
But before either of these, let's now look at the importance of pronunciation.

954
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,360
Dave Slasher, one of the original podcasters, talked about his love of Spanish and mixed

955
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,800
and culture the other day. Dave is clearly not a beginner, but he's still wants to improve his

956
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,160
pronunciation. Let's listen to Dave. Even when I'm doing book learning on the Spanish,

957
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,800
it's good to have something to help me with my crappy pronunciation and my, you know,

958
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:13,120
crappy Gringo accent. So I have said before how in science fiction fandom of which I've been,

959
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:19,280
you know, a proud member for 20 years, there's this like nipano-philic thing where people love

960
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,520
Japanese culture and they love anime and they love all that stuff and I've never really bought

961
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,840
into that and I've always had much more love for Mexican and Latin American culture.

962
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,280
And I don't know why I didn't get off the stick and try to start learning Spanish 20 years ago

963
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,760
because I've had this kind of interest and I saw this really cool

964
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,960
interview with Mark Freyne Felder with Jaime Hernandez of Love and Rockets and I thought that

965
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,480
interview was awesome and it was really cool to read because the Hernandez brothers probably are part

966
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,880
of what helped birth the fact that I have this love for Mexican and Latin culture.

967
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,840
Definitely don't want you brought the master next to us. Okay, that went out on the 26th of October

968
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,600
and if you want to listen to the rest of that or any of Dave's other podcasts,

969
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:17,360
you can check them out at www.hevilgeniuschronicles.org. Listen to how Dave pronounces Lucha Libre.

970
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:24,800
Lucha Libre is spelled L-I-B-R-E. Lucha Libre. The E at the end of the word

971
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,520
can not be pronounced A because it is not a sound that exists in Spanish.

972
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,960
A Spanish E is always pronounced A. This is where the really great things about Spanish.

973
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,960
And so you get the point. This is a guy who's going to help teach us Spanish but is doing it

974
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,280
right on top right on a care Christina but is doing it with the class. He's using us as examples

975
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,920
and that's a real teacher. This really has me excited and I am subscribed to this podcast

976
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,960
shipment before you know it. I might be Ablo some Espanolos right on and we're going to leave it at

977
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,240
that for today's source code if you don't mind. Come on to you from the castle.

978
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,400
A good 15 minutes worth of show and lots of podcasts tomorrow. I promise I'll have some music in the

979
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:22,560
show and we'll have our final curry castle podcast so hope you'll join us here for the
