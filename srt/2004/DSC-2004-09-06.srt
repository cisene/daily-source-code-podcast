1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,500
The game is over.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
The game is over.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Well, this is my day. September 6th, 2004.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
comes to you either via download or maybe subscription through RSS and the iPodder.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm not on curry and it is...

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we should think about breaking format right off the bat here for a second.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
First of all, it's my sister-in-law, Yvonne's birthday today, so I want to play a song

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
for her.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And everybody could do, use a little bit of energy on a Monday morning.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And a long time ago, a couple of guys called the Easy Beats put a song together that really

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
sums it up and really...

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
if you need that boost on them.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm gonna grab this, it's gonna be mad, I'm gonna think it, come and choose it.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm gonna have to go to sleep in the city

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Don't stop, don't stop.

16
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm not a fan of the game.

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
I'm not a fan of the game.

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't have a father who loves me

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't have a father who loves me

20
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,500
And actually, I realized that I did a very KC KC mask announcement a couple of guys

21
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
a bit long time ago, called the easy bleeds deliverable.

22
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Anyway, sorry about that.

23
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Oh, memo to self.

24
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I have to find the KC KC long distance dedication, dead puppy snippet.

25
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
That's a classic.

26
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,500
And for those of you who know who KC KC is, I guess he's still on the air with his, what

27
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
am I doing?

28
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
He's not doing the top of the top 40 anymore.

29
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Well, anyway, countdown radio show.

30
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
So I did a pretty good weekend.

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Saturday was really nice because I went to the air show at Laylee's South here in the Netherlands.

32
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
And I was an invited guest, which meant I got to fly in.

33
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,500
You had a PPR number, which means you have a previous prior request or you have a permission

34
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
to land.

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
It was cool, you know, because they had me land and then turn in right into the main stage,

36
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
which is in front of the...

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
thousand people there and then flew air your hover taxi to off to us.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
cool to do that. That's the moment when you like, I don't want to fuck this up. You know, let's look

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
good. Well, we're having a taxi. But it was really nice. It was very well organized. They had,

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
yeah, they really did a professional job. They were classic old planes to brand new VLAs.

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
These very light aircraft, which really started out as experimental crafts and are now a lot of them

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
are certified and very inexpensive to own and operate, but very luxurious and actually quite fast

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
as well. And while I was, all they said, jet fighters and aerobatics. And I actually posted a picture

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
of the blue eagles from the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom who did a helicopter,

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
didn't demonstration with the four gazelles and one links, which was capable of doing looped

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
elopes, pretty intense. And then I was walking amongst the crowd at a certain point, I had to get a new

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
battery out of the helicopter for my camera. I heard someone call my name and I heard it was an American

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
accent. So I turned around and this is guy, which is himself as John.

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
A developer, now who had quit his job just recently so I congratulated on that.

50
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I think he quit his job in the States and moved over here too.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Lighten, which is a big university town. And he said that he had heard about the air show on

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the source code the previous day. And he decided to come to the show. He didn't even know there was

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
an air show on. So we chatted for a little bit and it was just really cool to see what the reaches

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
of a show like this. And from there, we got back home safe, which means we had a really good day.

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And I ran to my email hoping that someone had picked up on Dave Winer's birthday hint and made

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
a template for dailysourcecode.com. No such luck, no designs, not an inkling. And then of course,

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
it got pretty depressing as I don't know what the coverage was in the States, but here in another

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
of the Russian school drama was just so intense and they just kept on going the images just kept

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
coming back. There was so much video footage of it all and especially as a parent it hurts so

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
much to think about what those kids went through and what the parents are going through and just

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
what everyone's going through and what was the...

62
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
It's just, and you know, what are we coming to?

63
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,500
You know, it's, you know, part of this was an accidental detonation at whatever bombs

64
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
they had with them.

65
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,500
But I understood there was also one woman who would detonate it herself.

66
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm thinking, man, you know, what despair are people in this can't just be religion.

67
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I don't believe that.

68
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I think that there's a lot, you know, people are just driven to the edge.

69
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,500
And if your kids are killed and you're in Chechnya and your husband's been carted off and

70
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,500
you've never seen them again, maybe out of despair, you, all you can think of is, look,

71
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm going to give you a taste of your own medicine.

72
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
It's just, it's crazy, you know, people are popping off all over the globe.

73
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,500
This is not exclusive to, to this conflict or to the Middle East, you know, to Palestine

74
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,500
or, or Iraq or, or anywhere for that matter, you know, Bali.

75
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
It's happening everywhere.

76
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Suicide bombers.

77
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
This is, people are really going to desperate needs, desperate measures.

78
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
So anyway, I...

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
can't change that yet.

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Foling could reprogram bits of the world that would feel so good.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So this is the Daily Source Code.

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's where users and developers party together and we're very proud of it.

83
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Something we've been talking about a lot on the show is audio books.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
See I made a note to myself to look at this email from a hermit in Montreal.

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Who sent this to me.

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He's just discovered the Daily Source Code the other day.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think it's fascinating.

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He says that he spends way too much money on audible.com as it is, but really loves the reviews.

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He says they also have a lot of good free content you can download.

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They actually are a really good source for NPR periodicals.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And indeed if you're a member of audible you can download a lot of that stuff for free.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He recommends the talisman by Stephen King.

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There's a, he says the first version was the best with Frank Mueller as the narrator.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He also says no crash was cool.

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This month we bought the dark tower part six by Stephen King.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The seventh and final book to release.

97
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,500
on the Stephen King's birthday, which is the 21st of September. And he also got Princess

98
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
of Ireland also recommended by Audible users. So there you go, if only I could get an

99
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
RSS feed of someone's recommendations. You know, wouldn't that be great and a little snippet

100
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
as an enclosure so I could just zap through on my iPod in the morning and see if I like

101
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
the speaker, see if the story sounds interesting, maybe listen to a little bit of a review. It

102
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,500
could be actually, I was thinking about that the other day, one way we could do this, developers

103
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,500
listen up. So let's say I'm listening to different audio books on my iPod. And I know the iPod

104
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
can do this, I have no idea how it works with other devices, I'm sure there's...

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So if I'm listening to an audio book, I can give that a rating, one to five stars.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can do that on your iPod.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a selection you can just thumb through and get to.

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So what if I set it up?

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So when I re-dock my iPod, it went in, a little program went in and said, let's take anything

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that has four stars or above and create an RSS file from that and upstream it and then put

111
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
links into the pages where they can be downloaded and reviews, etc.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It would be a way to kind of do your review on the fly without too much effort.

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think it's technically possible and well, in the next few weeks to come, I'll probably

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
give it a whirl and see if I can get it done.

115
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Dave Winer posted that he had taken my recommendations and purchased Snowcrash and John Stewart's book

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
which I'm still listening to.

117
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I love it so much.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I only really turn it on when I know that I'm not going to be disturbed by any one or anything.

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But what was interesting is I remember I told you I paid $7.95 for John Stuart's book and David

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
apparently got it for $4.95. So maybe Audible is really just a little bit more expensive than the rest.

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I like it a lot though. It seems to work fine for me in every little online library so you can

122
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
delete files if you want to go back and download it again you can. And of course,

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it's a lot of snow crash waiting in the wings to be red but haven't started that one.

124
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's something probably when I really take a full day off.

125
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I had a big oh wow experience over the weekend. The Skype client for Mac OS 10 was released.

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I've heard a lot about Skype. I actually know Nicholas and Janice, who created Skype, who created

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
a Kaza because I met them several years ago when we were working on the Jambi stuff.

128
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
they were working on creating super nodes.

129
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
And then those guys really knew what they were talking about.

130
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
And they were really smart about this stuff.

131
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
They've created a basically a voice over IP,

132
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,500
well, there's a buzzword, voice over IP application program

133
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
that you can use to make telephone calls with.

134
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
And the way they do it,

135
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
they use some of the peer-to-peer concepts behind Kazaar

136
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
presumably to make it all work.

137
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,500
And that doesn't interest me too much because

138
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
this is available in many different forms.

139
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
And you've probably heard about the voice over IP,

140
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
buzz for maybe a couple of years now.

141
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
And I was like, yeah, sure, I can use iChat.

142
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
There's different programs that will allow me to do that.

143
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
There's some drawbacks to it.

144
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I don't like being that people can see I'm online, so they say, he's online, so thus I can go

145
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,500
column up or I chat him or whatever. So not to keen on that. But it was interesting.

146
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,500
And this is the part that I didn't get until I actually tried it, is that you can use Skype,

147
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,500
and that's spelled SKYPE. By the way, so it's Skype.com, I believe it's their URL.

148
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,500
You can actually use this, you type in a phone number, and it will call that telephone,

149
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:53,500
so you can have a conversation from your computer over the internet to a regular phone line.

150
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
And that's when, you know, and only did I actually sit there, I was sitting with my laptop,

151
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
and I just had, I didn't have headphones or a microphone on, just using the internet.

152
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
called our Belgian number, the house line,

153
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and Patricia picked up.

154
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
She was sitting there right next to me

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and she didn't know that I was calling

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and then I'd start talking to her.

157
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it was so, wow, this is weird.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's talking into his laptop

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and I'm talking to him on the telephone.

160
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That was a real brain reset moment there for a second.

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I started to delve in and find out how this works.

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And it turns out there's a lot of voice over IP service providers.

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And what appears to be the main standard

164
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that people are adhering to

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
something called SIP.

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Sit, I'm not quite sure what it stands for,

167
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
but I'm sure it has to do with some standardization

168
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
of how you do voice over IP, so voice over the internet.

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And what these companies do is they have local dial in numbers.

170
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You've probably heard of J-Facts or some service

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
where you can basically rent or buy or rent a phone line.

172
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And that'll go straight to a voicemail box

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and so someone to you, so actually I have a number in New York.

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can call it my New York number.

175
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And it's only a local phone.

176
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
phone call and then what it does is it takes the phone call and then it's already on the

177
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
internet. So sending the message to me is just using internet protocols and email and I have

178
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
a special web place I can go to as well to listen to my archive messages. They also do

179
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
it for fax's same thing. You can add another fax line or if I wanted to I could say, hey,

180
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I want a local phone line in Los Angeles or I want one in Ireland. So I've used that and

181
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
that's been around for a while and that's actually works pretty well. This is the exact

182
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
same concept where you say, I want a phone line, I want a phone number in New York. So people

183
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,500
in New York can give me a call. Maybe I want to look like I have an office in New York

184
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
and I want one in LA and whatever. And then when people call that number at that point, it's

185
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
basically only a local call. That's why it doesn't cost very much. That's where your voice

186
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,500
over IP provider picks up the call and then goes out and finds your computer to say, hey,

187
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,500
ring ring, you've got a call and set up the call. So basically you have a phone number that

188
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
works.

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
like a phone can be called from any phone and you can call to any phone and you have the

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
same number that remains with you. And because the distance, if you're calling long distance,

191
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
is really on your local phone call, that's why they can give you incredibly cheap rates. So I could

192
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
actually call New York from my house in Belgium. It's still ours, but about to not be. And I can make

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
that call for, I spec'd it out. There's one service plan I could get it for 1.7 cents per minute.

194
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Unheard of. Literally unheard of prices. Now of course, you're probably saying, yeah, but you know,

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't want to take phone calls on my computer. And it also has a very hands-free feel to it,

196
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
which is just not nice. So a lot of these service providers are, and this is what it comes down to,

197
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because this system, anyone can set up with your, I think they're called DID, your local dial-in number.

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Any company can rent time, rent phone numbers, and set something like this up. Where they're going to

199
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,500
in the differentiation and the United Unique Selling Proposition, if you will, to give you a marketing

200
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:19,500
term, is in the services, so really expanded voicemail capabilities, conferencing capabilities,

201
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,500
anything you can think of that any service that you're getting now for your local phone company

202
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:33,500
and then some and just think of all the capabilities of being able to attach internet capabilities

203
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,500
to a phone call. There's a lot of richness in there. So you don't really want to be doing this on

204
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,500
your computer, so any service provider that's really serious about their business will also give you

205
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,500
what they call a SIP phone, so they'll give you a software version, which you can make calls with

206
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,500
from any computer in the world as long as it's connected to the internet and has some reasonable bandwidth

207
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,500
but even that isn't really necessary because voice is so low in data intensity.

208
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,500
One day to volume I should say perhaps, they give you a SIP phone which is just like a regular phone,

209
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:14,500
only you plug it into either you.

210
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
your router or your cable modem or your USB or they have all different kinds of versions

211
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
or if you can just, if it's always, I think they actually might even have a Wi-Fi version.

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And it looks and feels and acts just like a real phone.

213
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You pick it up and then it'll give you a dial tone.

214
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not really giving you a dial tone.

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's giving you a fake dial tone but it sounds like a dial tone.

216
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You dial your number and then from there it's just like the version on your PC and you're

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
making real calls.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And conversely when a call comes in, it'll ring.

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Even better than that is a little version which is a box which sits between in between

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
your network so your cable modem when you're at ADSL or you know, and you're, I don't

221
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
know if they have a Wi-Fi version but presumably Wi-Fi as well.

222
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And on the other end you plug in your existing phone and your or your existing phone system.

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So then there's really no difference between picking up your phone and making calls and

224
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
receiving calls versus with a local phone company versus voice over IP.

225
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,500
That was like, that just blew me away because this changes the entire model of how phone companies make

226
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,500
money and essentially it just kills them. Home on, I'm going to take a sip here.

227
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I've gotten into the habit of drinking Schwepp's Indian tonic during the source code.

228
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,500
a little bit of mother earth. So anyway, I can see this Skype thing really going places and I've

229
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm determined this week to work with the the version on my computer and make my calls

230
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,500
that I need to make over this system and just see you know see see how the experience is.

231
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
There is seems like there's a little bit of a delay on Skype but you know I might try out different

232
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,500
versions of different companies. Skype by the way as far as I know does not give you an incoming

233
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,500
phone number that's unique but that can only be so far off. I mean it's everyone's going to be

234
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
offering the same just going to be how how how cool are your features going to be no call forwarding

235
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
and you name it there's there's going to be a lot of stuff going on. And of course you're saying well

236
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,500
you know is this you know I use a cell phone you know that's for me in fact that has always been my

237
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
only number is my GSM cell phone and that's what everybody reaches me on. Now granted traveling

238
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:38,500
between two countries I often wind up paying a lot of money a lot of roaming.

239
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
fees. Probably upwards of a dollar a minute when I call from Belgium to the Netherlands and I also have to pay when there's

240
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Incoming on the roaming. So that's you know, I'm really bad

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But around 2,000 euros a month, so about $23, $2200. That's a lot of money.

242
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But I think that this, as it evolves, I think just as well basically, as Wi-Fi becomes

243
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
more free and more available. Let's look into the crystal ball for a second. Hold on a second.

244
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's rub the crystal ball and let's talk about the future of Voice Over IP.

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So, as Wi-Fi becomes more prevalent and available everywhere, and Dave Wein has been traveling through

246
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the country. He's noticing that Wi-Fi is really becoming just a commodity, and then I have

247
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
to agree with him that it will be free. Wi-Fi will be just, which coffee shop you're going to go to,

248
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
which library you're going to go to, what restaurant you're going to go to, what lunchroom.

249
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
go to your choice at a certain point will come down to do they have Wi-Fi or not and they're not going to charge you for it. It's just going to be a part of the deal. There you go. There's Wi-Fi.

250
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
for being for being our guest. So if we have Wi-Fi really built out everywhere,

251
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
then I see no reason why you can't take your your handheld. So let's say it's a pocket PC or

252
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
or the cell phone manufacturers, I'm sure will do the same thing if they have Wi-Fi built in.

253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
gadgets built into a regular phone. I mean, it can be done at your home. Then all you really need is a Wi-Fi connection.

254
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And I think that, you know, beside the car, which, you know, maybe that's the hardest part.

255
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And that's where you have to switch to a regular cell phone technology.

256
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I think that, you know, your office buildings and everyone will have this capability.

257
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And maybe you just will just like in a smaller commerce, you know, you see,

258
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you may say, hey, we, I don't want to feel like doing business with you.

259
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
At least not at your office because you don't have Wi-Fi. My phone won't work.

260
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But I think that as it continues to build with enough Wi-Fi, it'll be possible.

261
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And the roaming between Wi-Fi day stations, I've found is not, you know, that groovy, certainly not if you're,

262
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
it's not going to work very well if you're made conversation. But hey, look, if it comes down to saving

263
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
a lot of money and sticking it to the man, I say it can be done. And then of course, as we get further

264
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
than that, if there's enough Wi-Fi, and I don't really understand how it works yet, but you know,

265
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
we can start to integrate meshed networks and we can have the...

266
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Wi-Fi stations all connect to each other with different WDS I think is the protocols so they

267
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,500
can expand their network and I'll talk to each other and actually could become a new form of

268
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
internet backbone but oh no the crystal ball is getting cloudy. I'm clearly gone too far.

269
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:35,500
So that was my Skype experience very impressed by VoiceOver IP. Was listening to the latest IT

270
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:42,500
conversations the Gilmore gang which was from Friday the 3rd and I didn't get until last night.

271
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I listened to a bit of it on Saturday I drove up to Abraida about a 20 minute drive, went up to

272
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,500
visit a couple of friends on the way back so I heard probably about half of it and listened

273
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,500
to the rest of it last night. As usual it's Steve Gilmore and Doc Surles and I think John Udell

274
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,500
and then there were some analysts who were all talking about Microsoft and Longhorn.

275
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Now I'm going to touch on this for a second because this is

276
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
developers and users of party together on source code.

277
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I didn't take a lot of effort, but I made a concerted effort to listen to what they were

278
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
talking about and try and understand.

279
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Just to see if I can boil this down, apparently Microsoft has been promising a new version

280
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of Windows.

281
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This version of Windows is called Longhorn.

282
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Let me just pause there for a second because this is a bad name.

283
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I do not get any happy associations with Longhorn.

284
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In fact, I get an association of one of those pink Cadillacs with the Longhorn on the front

285
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
coming to pick me up to take me to some horrible roadshow gig, which I will tell you about

286
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
one of these days.

287
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So, to me, I'm eating like Longhorn.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That sounds like something from Texas.

289
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That sounds like George Bush.

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I get all kinds of weird associations.

291
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So, Longhorn doesn't work for me.

292
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I want something sexy like Tiger Panther.

293
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But this seems to be just about as important for Microsoft as...

294
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,500
switch to OS X was for Apple. And there were a couple of things in Longhorn that people

295
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,500
were very excited about, but from what I understand one of the most important ones was

296
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,500
this Windows FS, the Windows filing system, which is, and I don't know much about filing

297
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,500
systems other than, you know, you've got a path to a file and somehow you're...

298
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,500
that when you're clicking around and dragging and dropping stuff.

299
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,500
But a sophisticated filing system, we much more would have a, I guess like a database

300
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:49,500
attached to it with XML so that you can address the file system in a more convenient slash

301
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
intelligent manner.

302
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Something like that.

303
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
And this was, you know, they've delayed this.

304
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Actually they were doing as they're releasing longhorn but not with the sophisticated filing

305
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
system in there.

306
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500
And they're saying some other longhorn features which weren't supposed to come out until longhorn

307
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,500
comes out, which now they're saying is 2006 are going to be released before then.

308
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,500
So and, you know, some APIs stuff that I guess people were are supposed to be relatively happy

309
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
about.

310
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
And it was interesting.

311
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,500
If you're on Wall Street or you trade stocks and.

312
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
because there's some good points on what this is going to mean to Microsoft long-term,

313
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Microsoft in terms of growth, in terms of value, in terms of cash flow.

314
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And I find that interesting to listen to.

315
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And to me, it seems like this is a humongous opportunity for a whole bunch of people to come in

316
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and in fact, this is discussed on the show that open source may get some more legs on this,

317
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and there's all kinds of reasons for that. But it was kind of fun listening to it and understanding,

318
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
really starting to understand what Microsoft's business is and how this is going to work for them

319
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
or not. And again, though, I must say that there were a lot of buzzwords being used,

320
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
you know, players, space, a play. I love that. And you use the word a play as in Google is a search play.

321
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So what is source code to kind of play is that. It's probably a bad play.

322
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But there was a lot of talk about developers and I do want to stop at that for-

323
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,500
second because when I hear people especially analysts talk about developers, you know,

324
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
and developers will do this, developers will do that. And I've had developers work for me personally.

325
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:43,500
And I didn't know anything about developers and point honestly, I not until the past few months

326
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
that I really understand why developers are the way they are. I mean, these are like speech writers.

327
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,500
You know how on the West Wing, that once in a while Rob Lowe's character or one of the other people,

328
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,500
they'll write a speech for the president and it'll be a real great,

329
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,500
a nice moment in the episode because there's some real patriotic feelings and what the country

330
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,500
stands for. It's just a really good speech. Well, that's what, you know, so then a speech writer is

331
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
in his vibe and he's pouring his heart out and putting his heart into his work. And that's the way

332
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,500
developers work best. If you're working on something that you really want to make and you want it to happen,

333
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,500
it's just writing, you know, it's not like you're tinkering with a screwdriver.

334
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,500
language and this language does something and it can emotionally move someone when you

335
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,500
write something, it can make a computer do something, but it's just language and it's writing

336
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:42,500
and I think good writing takes inspiration and you can't overlook that.

337
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Someone has to be really into the project that they're doing otherwise.

338
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,500
It's just never going to be the same as they're something that they're really interested in.

339
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,500
So if you hire developers, try and get ones that are interested in what you're actually

340
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
doing.

341
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,500
At the end of the show and I was actually laying in the bathtub last night and my wife was

342
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
just walking into the bathroom and I started laughing my head off because at the very end

343
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:15,500
of the Gilmore gang, Steve Gilmore gave me this humongous plug about the source code and

344
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,500
it was extremely nice and I had really appreciated it.

345
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
And there you go.

346
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
That was nice.

347
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
I've learned you've get credit to take it and shut up.

348
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Now let's talk about iPodder for a second.

349
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
iPodder has a home.

350
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I created iPodder.org, which I did because

351
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
what to be.org because that's what open source

352
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
or open whatever seems to be registered under.

353
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And this is totally meant as an open project.

354
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm going to be real happy to maintain this website,

355
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
which is part weblog and there are two directories in there,

356
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and one is for downloads.

357
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And whenever if you have a new iPodder script that will work,

358
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you can actually do a submission form under the directory.

359
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And you can send me a URL to .2 and I'm gladly add that.

360
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And also I've started a directory of feeds that have regular enclosures coming down the pipeline.

361
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And again, if you have a suggestion for that, you can also click on the link.

362
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And so I think now we've got it all official.

363
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
iPodder.org. And that's where you can point.

364
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
to point people to who want to use iPodder.

365
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Have you have any comments about that?

366
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Obviously, just send them to me adamantcurry.com

367
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,500
or comment on the weblog at live.curry.com.

368
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:47,500
And a while back, I'd also asked all of the source code listeners

369
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
where you listen to the source code.

370
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
And Steve Garfield made a video of how and where he listens

371
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
to source code and check this out.

372
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
What he's doing is he has a thing is the Iraq,

373
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
which is a little FM transmitter,

374
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,500
which you can plug into your into your Mac or any computer.

375
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
I think it just uses audio out.

376
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
And you can tune it to an empty frequency

377
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
and he's broadcasting that signal throughout his house.

378
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
And he showed how he was listening to source code

379
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,500
in his kitchen on a, it looked like a boom box up on the cabinet,

380
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
which he probably had to put up on the on the covers

381
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,500
because the antenna or the power was too low of his of his Iraq.

382
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,500
But it's true, this is, and it's wacky.

383
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
turned on that radio and hadn't told anyone where the source was coming from.

384
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They would have said, oh wow, atoms on the radio.

385
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
And that's the kind of magic that I like, you know, the stuff that we're doing at iPod or where

386
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,500
it really seems like your iPod is doing all this stuff and aggregating everything where actually

387
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,500
it isn't it's your computer and we're just connecting all the bits. Which brings me to a thought

388
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,500
that Marcus Mouler, who I've been working with for a long time now, he keeps all my servers running

389
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:03,500
and developed stuff and he works with me on all kinds of fun-related projects. He lives in Pasadena,

390
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
which is great because then he can watch the servers while I'm sleeping in vice versa.

391
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,500
And by the way, and Marcus, I know you're listening, please put up a page and send me the

392
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,500
little so I can point to it of the radio user land tool that you made or scripts. I think there's

393
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:27,500
two scripts that are also 100% iPod or fodder. So send a URL to me because I want to add that to the

394
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,500
directory. But he's also working on a concept, which I think is quite interesting. He says,

395
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,500
you know, maybe we could even simply, if I get it right now, Marcus will have to set me straight if not.

396
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What if we created a central resource that does the aggregation of feeds and creates

397
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
basically a list of just extracts the URLs, or you have a filter on it so you can say,

398
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
this is where Tivo is getting into the picture and that's why I love it Marcus, I'm totally

399
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
on to you.

400
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So instead of having a relatively dumb aggregator that we call iPodder and just sits there and

401
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
pulls in these feeds, we could, for any different type of version, you'd have to put new logic

402
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
into the iPodder script.

403
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
We could create a central resource that you can actually address with perhaps an API

404
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
or whatever, a web interface as well.

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We just say, hey, I want all links from Adam Curry and Dave Slusher and IT conversations

406
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
for the past three days and it'll just spit back a list of URLs to the content.

407
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And that then could be used through a simplified version of iPodder.

408
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,500
to pull that into your iPod or your MP3 player device.

409
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
So I asked him to write that up as well.

410
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Hold on a second, the dog is just going crazy.

411
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Patricia's off to the...

412
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Chrissy!

413
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
See, this is our 15 year old maltees

414
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
who was three years over life expectancy.

415
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
She is deaf and blind.

416
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
She's not dumb.

417
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I'm curious, baby.

418
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Come on, it's okay.

419
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
It's okay, baby.

420
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
You want to go upstairs?

421
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
See, whenever she senses that Patricia's not in the house,

422
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
then she kind of starts to freak out

423
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
and just starts to bark and bark and bark.

424
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I take her upstairs and she can walk around there.

425
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
I'll give me exactly seven minutes

426
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
before she starts barking again.

427
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Okay, let me get back.

428
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Sorry about this little interlude here.

429
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Okay.

430
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Let me just swipe the e-book.

431
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay.

432
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And let's see, listen to the recent Dave Slusher, Evil Genius Chronicles.

433
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He says he's going to stop mentioning my name.

434
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's okay.

435
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Dave, I think it's about time we all stop talking about each other and get down the business.

436
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Although I do want to make one comment, that as a user, it's very hard for me to explain

437
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to a developer when a piece of code is not doing what I expected it to do.

438
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Now I've learned that the best bug report is to say, here's what I expected, and here's

439
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
what happened.

440
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And I know that you didn't really appreciate the fact that I talked about your code on

441
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the source code.

442
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But really it's not your code, I think the problem is my code.

443
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's my Apple script.

444
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But what I'd like, and I'm just going to do a review here.

445
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay.

446
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So here's what I expect to happen.

447
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What I expect to happen is when the chron...

448
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:47,500
your code, get enclosure, a Pearl script. I wanted to bring everything in, put it into

449
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:54,500
appropriate playlist based upon the channel names in the feed. And it does all that.

450
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I mean, that's exactly what I wanted to do. And that would be the end of it. I love

451
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,500
the caching that you've built in. I love the fact that you sport AACs. That's all fantastic.

452
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,500
What it does instead, and I'll talk about version 2.0, is, first of all, it brings iTunes to

453
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,500
the front every single time. And I know you put that in as a safety, but that's really

454
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,500
irritating because if it runs, if the cron job runs while I'm working, then it'll pop

455
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:27,500
it up for every new file it brings in. So I don't want it to do that. And it's creating duplicates.

456
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Sometimes hundreds of duplicates, sometimes only one. And that's in the playlist on iTunes.

457
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:40,500
If we can fix that, it would be perfect. Everything would be just beautiful. And I love your script.

458
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm not using...

459
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
using my own, I'm using yours, so I just really want to try and make it better.

460
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So what are we at now, 35 minutes? Well, at least we've been reasonably productive.

461
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Song of the day, I know we already had Friday on my mind, but I had something else lined

462
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
up, which I thought you'd appreciate. I always try to put a little something different on

463
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the source code. This is by a guy called Richard Cheese, and you'll even hear his little promo

464
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
for Richard Cheese.com in the song. He's basically a Las Vegas performer who does contemporary

465
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
songs in a less contemporary way, or is that the other way around? Well, just for yourself

466
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and check out Richard Cheese.

467
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We'd like to do a song for you from a band from the 1970s. This is a pretty popular number,

468
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
one of the most requested songs of all time. It's about a gal who's trying to purchase something.

469
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He's trying to purchase a means of getting from down here up to there.

470
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We have a little mood lighting on this job. Thank you.

471
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Let's see we swing this tonight, huh?

472
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Hit it, baby.

473
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I think you'll like this one.

474
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:04,000
There's a lady in shore, all that blitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

475
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:15,000
When she gets there she knows, those stars maybe close with the words she can't get what she came for.

476
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, Scooby-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

477
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
When she gets there she knows, those stars...

478
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The tree, the brood, the sun, the sea, all the thorns and all me down.

479
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It makes me wonder if there's a puzzle in your head's roll.

480
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,500
It's just a sprinkling for the me, wait

481
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Yes, there are two paths you can go by but in the long run

482
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,500
There's two times of changing road you're on

483
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Reach your...

484
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000

Hey there's that lady we all know She's standing white line once show

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:05,500
And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last

487
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,500
