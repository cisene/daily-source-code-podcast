00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 820.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't got a wreath.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Take your sauce cold.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't got a wreath.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't got a wreath.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't got a wreath.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In the next generation radio coach, any of my years.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, fantastic.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a battle, curry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The feeling.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
See it.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But today, if you can't think that doesn't matter any way,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you will never understand because it happens to bang.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And it feels so good inside, working the glass.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So good, so good, so hip at somebody.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's so good.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's at a sight.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You could touch it.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's so good.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's just so sweet.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But it makes me feel good.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I couldn't actually touch it.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wow.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Time.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even a light in the macro, so good.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They don't understand what's in both.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's so good.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000

Not notice I left a daily off there because that's just the way it's gonna be from now on

192
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,640
It's just too much happening. It was in San Francisco and it was actually a

193
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,920
Pretty good time. We had beautiful weather all week long everyone was even talking about it

194
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,680
They loved it so much they even forgot that they were in the midst of a severe drought and actually need water

195
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,920
But so I kind of took the week off from mevio today. I took the week. Well

196
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,000
Essentially I really didn't have any time to do a source code

197
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:57,320
Considering just how much time goes into it because I I don't know I just can't do those short shows and I've also had an

198
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
minor epiphany

199
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,600
That we talked about on Noah gender. I want to do more Noah genders and so if that means it's gonna take up the spot

200
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,520
of a daily source code and I can keep that at least to one make it a weekly source code

201
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,680
I think that's what I want to do because it just

202
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,320
It's uh, I've always worked a lot better with a partner in any type of

203
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
Actually in any type of venture now. I think about it

204
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,000
So that just seems to be working that's getting a lot of traction huge audience

205
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,320
Yeah, lots of reaction and I got to tell you man

206
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
The hate is here

207
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,960
I don't know what it is but in the last maybe it's just the last couple of shows that

208
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,040
That I've been doing with John and and the source code all of a sudden there's people sending me emails and

209
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,560
Twitter's that are you know hammering me for hammering the president like I'm against Obama like it's only Obama that I don't care about it

210
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,840
Like where were these people when Bush was president? Please

211
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Then of course, you know, I think Barack Obama is an adorable guy

212
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,040
And I can tell that he's sweating because

213
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,840
There's a new script and a change of storyline every single day is they they basically try to keep it all together

214
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,480
They being I guess the military industrial complex the people the shadow government

215
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,040
Whatever you want to call it the people really running the show

216
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,560
Who are writing legislation and look at the transparency. It's so little

217
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,120
Whitehouse dot gov. I check it every single day so really behind

218
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,680
On executive orders and member and a member and I my member and that

219
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,760
That the president is which doesn't really mean anything. It's not a not a legal enforced

220
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,320
Statement. It's more just exactly that it's a statement and then all these confirmations and tax

221
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,120
I don't want to call a tax evasion but back tax is not paid which hey I've been there

222
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
And through no fun of my own in fact

223
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,680
And I didn't get treated the same way. Let me tell you that

224
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,440
But now there's a how man. I feel so bad for the president nice to go on all of these wonky talk shows

225
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,560
It's a talk to Katy Curric and has to explain to her why oh well, you know

226
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,400
Maybe this guy wasn't so good and he withdrew his name and yet we can't have two standards and yeah, you know

227
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,400
We got to we got to put limits in place for

228
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,480
For executive salary for banks people who accept tart money and buy American, but I don't really mean buy American because I don't want to upset

229
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,760
Like the whole rest of the world with protectionism

230
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,040
It's coming apart at the seams. That's that's what I'm seeing

231
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,080
So I'm jolly happy to talk to you guys about it. I have the Skype in phone number available if you want to call in

232
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,360
2 0 1 7 9 3 8 3 2

233
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm gonna get a UK number for the next show. So it's a plus 1 2 0 1 7 9 3 8 3 3 2

234
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,720
That's the direct studio line everybody. I think I can handle exactly two lines with my Skype in number

235
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,880
But that's it seems to be more than sufficient

236
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,080
So lady Patricia's off. She's in the Netherlands doing her judging thing for Holland love losers

237
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,840
Of course, I mean Holland's got talent and

238
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,480
So she's been real busy with that these are the you know the pre-selection rounds

239
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
So there's basically she has to look at

240
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,120
Hundreds of people over the course of a couple of days. She almost didn't make it out. She was she had to go out Monday

241
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I returned from San Francisco Sunday

242
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,000
You know, I was kind of rushing back so I could still see your own basically hand off of the keys because there's you know

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,480
Still work going on here in the terrace as we bring it up to lady Patricia like standards

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And so you know

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,240
She took off Monday morning just as I mean the snow had been falling all night and it and it was just

246
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,080
Rages we had 20 inches of snow in London and I knew there was a car company who would get me a good eggnuch bloke

247
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,120
In a good sturdy car and he got her there all right and I've been checking the website because she loves easy jet

248
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
As does the entire curry family

249
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
And I was checking the website and I was looking all the cancellations

250
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,880
But not a single cancellation for London Amsterdam. She got to the airport and of course all flights canceled even though the website didn't reflect it even too

251
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,280
Ourly updates later. It still didn't reflect it

252
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
She was able to hop on a BA flight

253
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,320
So she got lucky and she got out because after that the country just shut down schools closed

254
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
But Christina hasn't been to school for three days

255
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,760
Trash is piling up outside because

256
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
It hasn't been collected

257
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,760
It's just that the whole place is a shambles and they expect another 10 to 15 inches tonight now this may not hit London

258
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,360
But it's certainly affecting other areas of the UK which people often forget you haven't

259
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,000
Doesn't happen in London, but then it's not really happening

260
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
The so I'm here with the kids

261
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,720
The children's being a Christina and boyfriend Dexter

262
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,800
And Dexter is doing some kind of movie in in

263
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,360
Canary Warf so even though he lives in Gilford he's been staying over here because it's much easier to get to the set

264
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
In the morning

265
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Actually he's staying with Christina out back in the in the apartment and

266
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,920
So it's been fun, you know hanging out with the kids watching

267
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
DVDs

268
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Kids do buy DVDs. I'll tell you they don't you know they don't really like to rip off movies to watch him on the computer

269
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,600
Seems like they really want the quality or at least some quality and get it on the screen

270
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Which is good that boats well for the yeah for the film industry

271
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,480
At least they still care about what they're seeing

272
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,120
Think about how horrible it is how much information you're actually missing listening to MP3s

273
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I mean it's a 10 to one compression so

274
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,720
You're just not getting the same amount of information and then when you actually that's why it may be concerts are so

275
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,160
You know so much in the upswing and that's where all the money is being made is because you actually hear real

276
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,240
Real sounds for the first time in your life probably if it's the first time you go to a concert

277
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:17,400
They're the sort of episode 8 to 0 got a lot of shit to go through and all of it's fun

278
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:28,120
Hit me up 2017 938332 the animals on the Charlie the rooms was so much cold

279
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
of them

280
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
My father was

281
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,960
So you're then at times for very hard when I was young

282
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
I was young

283
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,160
I spoke my first sickle at 10 and for girls

284
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,960
I had a bed in and I had quite a fall when I was young

285
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Hey

286
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,480
When I was young it was more important

287
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,360
Me and more pain but a lot from much now to yeah

288
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,680
When I was young

289
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
When I was young

290
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,680
I met my first love at 13

291
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:38,120
She was brown and I was pretty green and I learned quite a lot when I was young

292
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
When I was young

293
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,480
When I was young it was more important

294
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,960
Pain more pain but a lot from much now to yeah

295
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,040
When I was young

296
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,040
When I was young

297
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,920
My faith was so much stronger than

298
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:33,240
I believed in fellow men and I was so much older than

299
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,920
When I was young

300
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,320
These guys had a number one hit on the day I was born September 3, 1964

301
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,840
Wasn't this song? That was actually house the rising sun there

302
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,600
More famous song the animals with Eric Burton

303
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
When I was young

304
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,240
On the daily source code I forgot to tell you about the children

305
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,400
So we had all that snow so Christina actually did get up in the morning to see if she could get to school

306
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
It was like a ghost town outside

307
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,160
The tube wasn't running trains weren't running everything was at a complete standstill

308
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,280
So she came back home and then she indexed her spent about four and a half maybe five hours outside

309
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,440
And they built an enormous snowcock right on the steps leading up to the lovely

310
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Curry terrace

311
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm talking I put it on my flicker site and I also posted it on curry.com

312
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,720
It was huge and I must say anatomically interestingly correct

313
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
You know not built a scale of course and

314
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,080
You know they worked so hard on it. They were so proud of it now. I know Patricia would be horrified if she knew about this

315
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,560
So of course we took lots of pictures and I couldn't bring myself to knock it down

316
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
So it's been up for two days now

317
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,400
And yesterday I think one of the neighbors and I I actually expected someone to break it down

318
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Out of anger

319
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Someone put a trash bag

320
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,480
For the top which makes it actually even funnier

321
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
uh

322
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
So

323
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,040
It will it's

324
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:23,400
I check it every day to make sure it hasn't become one big block of ice that I actually can destroy it because it has to be gone by the time the lady p gets home

325
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
She will be utterly horrified

326
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,800
Plus one two oh one seven nine three eight three three two if there's something you want to talk about today

327
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
I also on Twitter

328
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,160
Follow me Adam Curry on Twitter. I see a Jeff Ridgeway just tweeted

329
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,880
Ha salt ban weapon HR 45 proposed build to require licensing and registration for all firearms

330
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:54,040
Yeah, I don't know too much about that because I'm not a gun not myself. Yeah, I do believe in the the right to bear arms and I think it's extremely important

331
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,160
But I don't follow that as much but I do understand that there's maybe not just this HR 45

332
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,520
But there's a couple of bills in the house right now. There even have

333
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Impressive co-sponsors

334
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,200
That essentially are meant to get rid of all guns and it makes sense because these guys they're not stupid

335
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,000
They know what's going on. They know that just like every other country in in the world

336
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
unrest is a foot

337
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,520
And people are getting pissed off and it's for a variety of reasons witness the United Kingdom just had wildcat strikes

338
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,520
Because they they want British jobs for or UK jobs for British workers which is a direct quote from

339
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Hair Gordon Brown

340
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,640
Who promised this in it's far back as 2007 and of course that goes contra to any

341
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
rule that is

342
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
comprised of the

343
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Trade agreements of the European Union which specifically states that you can do this they all agreed to it

344
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:02,680
They agreed that foreign companies would be allowed to bring in their workers from their country to work on projects if they bid cross

345
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Country or I should say state lines

346
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,440
And yeah, so now that doesn't seem like such a good idea before when everyone was getting money and the back

347
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,640
channels on the take pass and all this shit which has now been proven

348
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,440
Certainly in the in the government in the UK

349
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Lord's taking money for

350
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,560
Favorable votes on bills and adjustment actual amendments to bills

351
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
fitting the the laws

352
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
or fitting

353
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,760
Fitting the mission and motives of companies who they are befriended with

354
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
That's a nice way to put it

355
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:46,040
So they know that the that shit is gonna hit the fan pretty soon and it of course it will happen in the United States as well

356
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,920
It has to because people are gonna start getting very hungry right now. We're all still kind of

357
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Hoping

358
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,560
Man, what's I should play that song wishing and hoping and hoping and wishing

359
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
That's one

360
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Is that dusty

361
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,080
Sandy Shaw, maybe let me see let me see if I can find it home on oh that will be perfect wouldn't it

362
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,760
Sandy Shaw. I think it's Andy Shaw. I didn't want on the chat no

363
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Let me see

364
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,280
wishing and hoping and hoping and hoping no pop it on the string no

365
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
crap, maybe it's

366
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
wishing

367
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
and hoping

368
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,520
crap

369
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,880
Okay

370
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
That was a fun idea. Let's not do it

371
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
So

372
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,240
That's it. We're all just kind of wishing and hoping and hanging in there and companies are

373
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,280
Holding on to staff as long as they can because you know the stimulus bill is coming and there's a lot of confusion about that

374
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,600
Is it going to be is it stimulant enough

375
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,520
Is our tax cuts with the way to go or are is spending the way to go? Oh, I don't know the answer

376
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,080
But it seems to me like I'm hearing the same thing over and over again. It's just new faces saying it and it hasn't

377
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,320
worked so far and the only people who seem to be making out are the people receiving the money and it's not small business

378
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
It's big business

379
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,480
And now uh talking about a bad bank that's back on again

380
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
oh

381
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,200
Man and the worst thing. This is absolutely the worst thing now dusty springfield

382
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
How can I be such an idiot

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,400
That's what it was hold on dusty springfield

384
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,400
It was an enormous diek by the way, which kind of makes her hotter even though she was it wasn't really hot

385
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I

386
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,280
Can't find it wishing and hoping and to boom

387
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,560
What's the title that song that's and and I thought it was wishing and hoping that

388
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
crap

389
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Does anyone know

390
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Hope you don't mind, but I just have to

391
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Get this out of my system

392
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
uh crap

393
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
All right

394
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,440
You know what it is we got that 20 second delay on the stream so it takes a while before people hear what I'm asking for all right so maybe that'll pop up in a second

395
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,560
And I'll play that song. This is it's a golden idi

396
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,920
So this is really really disturbing to me

397
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,360
And I'm I've become incredibly

398
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
downtrodden and

399
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
downcast

400
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,720
Um, and I'll put this link in the show notes of course at

401
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,200
DailySourceco.com crossposted at curie.com common dreams dot org

402
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Posted

403
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,440
YouTube video and some editorial title of this

404
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,040
Of this post is NBC has an Aaron Burnett problem

405
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,480
And basically what it uh what this video and what the associated editorial

406
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
actually is a transcript

407
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,000
kind of says is that Aaron is

408
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
evil

409
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,040
And and and looking at it this is from now she was on

410
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,240
Ocean the Sunday meet the press

411
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,240
As a panless you know being interviewed she looks so stunningly beautiful

412
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm gonna read the words the captions that are put over this video while we listen to it together for a second

413
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,720
So Aaron Burnett CNBC's embedded journalist on Wall Street is how it starts on

414
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,160
bonuses or private jet use or or also just that they're not lending none of these things really are

415
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,720
Are the real issue here? Why isn't populism though has been amazing? I mean just the rhetoric out of

416
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,920
Barack Obama and Joe Biden this week that they talk use the word shameful and outrageous to refer to Wall Street

417
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,680
Practices that that that isn't choosing mean street versus Wall Street that is a completely false

418
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,440
Toys that is being put out

419
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
All right so let's go these people are idiots

420
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,960
You can't use another cut to Senator McCasco billion dollars in bonuses

421
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,120
What planet are these people on fair question here? I understand the outrage

422
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,480
Okay, do you is the caption that then pops up understand the populism silly populism that's just what the public wants

423
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
There are though

424
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Well the house so we say this

425
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,520
Please say it slowly the public's kind of dumb Aaron. I'm just reading the the captions here

426
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
It's so hurtful to have to do this

427
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,760
The taxpayer money's not being used to pay the bonuses

428
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,880
I think people could understand if you work for a company right if the three of us work for a company your guests

429
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,080
And I lost ten billion dollars but Steve over there

430
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,760
He made a billion dollars so overall the company actually loses money

431
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,920
But Steve went and did his very darned us for that company and he made money

432
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,560
So should he be paid for his work that's essentially what we're talking about here and reasonable people could argue about this

433
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,600
But many reasonable people would conclude yes, he should be paid for that

434
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:14,200
So now the title says Aaron Pailin Burnett Wall Street execs did their darnedist and I'm and at this point when I first saw this video

435
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I'm thinking well

436
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
You know she's really just

437
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,600
There is a degree of truth in what she's saying

438
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,640
Although man you look at those bonuses. They seem to go one for one ten million dollars and tarp ten billion dollars and tarp money

439
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Ten billion dollars and bonuses

440
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:40,600
But of course, you know there is some degree of business that has to be conducted at a certain level if you believe in the the whole concept of a bailout and so at this point

441
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm thinking you know, maybe she's really just

442
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
playing the devil's advocate and

443
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,040
Getting away with it doing a pretty good job, but God, it's really hurt to God. She's so pretty

444
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
Oh, man

445
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,880
Feel so horrible

446
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
She's one of them

447
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
She really is

448
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,520
And I think David you've raised a fair point which is maybe it's the whole use of the word bonus if you

449
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,640
Explained to people this is how they are compensated that might make a difference

450
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,920
Exactly a bonus is not a bonus silly public is the caption

451
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,400
But there's also a fundamental misunderstanding the tax pair of money isn't being taken and paid out in the form of bonuses

452
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,520
It goes in a separate pool, so we say a separate account

453
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,040
So maybe people don't care about that distinction, but it is there

454
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:34,840
Bro companies used a magic separate pool of money for bonuses. Yes, he's digging a hole. Hopefully his Aaron don't do this

455
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Please stop stop

456
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,400
Tell Aaron Bernat stop being an apologies for Wall Street, so now it's basically telling you to email her

457
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,680
And I'm looking through the comments and if you look at her

458
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Where is it?

459
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Somewhere there was a

460
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Bio

461
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
She's from council and foreign relations

462
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,280
She worked a Goldman Sachs. I mean all the death stars Aaron

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh no

464
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,760
Can she really be one of them? Maybe she's just dumb

465
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,440
Please please make it be that I still I still would love her even if she was just not smart

466
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,960
Damn

467
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,480

Okay, so actually I found the dusty springfield song but doesn't work anymore now

502
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
crap aroma

503
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:35,080
Now let's see what's going on in the news a couple of wacky stories that I've been following I hate it when the CDC

504
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,120
This Center for Disease Control and Prevention does this

505
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,320
They put out a

506
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
report warning

507
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
APB

508
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,080
widespread outbreak of flu has been reported in Virginia according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the first state to

509
00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:04,600
Report an outbreak which the CDC observed was on a slow start but CDC epidemiologist Anthony Fiori warned the U.S. might be hit by the chronic winter ailment within the next two weeks

510
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Since say oh

511
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Aside from Virginia the CDC reported localized flu outbreaks in Maryland and the District of Columbia

512
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,440
How conveniently located to our government

513
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Where was I based on it's weekly polls what are they doing telephone research now Virginia Department of Health epidemiologist Laura and Nikolai forecast high incidents of flu cases in the state for the next six to eight weeks

514
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,960
With the ailment running into March April even into May

515
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,440
Flu symptoms include fever aching muscles headache dry throat sore throat dry cough sore throat and lack of energy

516
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:51,960
According to the CDC flu vaccine manufacturers have shipped in lots of the shots for the 2008-2009 flu season is earliest August

517
00:31:51,960 --> 00:32:01,320
2008 they estimate 143 to 146 million doses of flu vaccine will be available for the current influenza season

518
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:10,120
Holy moly well I'm just gonna tell you this I am not getting a flu shot I recommend you do some research and perhaps you won't

519
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,400
Either I'd rather just stick it out because even if you take the shot it's only for one strain of the flu

520
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,400
Which apparently they have hence the antidote and

521
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,760
Fuck it, you know you need to be sick once in a while when it comes to flu take the flu

522
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
It'll make you a man

523
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Or woman oh

524
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,000
Yes

525
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,600
Aaron

526
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,640
I'll bring in your chip chicken soup. I'll make you feel good

527
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
I feel so torn about that

528
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Okay, let me see

529
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,240
Point clip penetrates super bowl broadcast. No, that's no fun

530
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
This was a funny story

531
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,920
Residents in northern Australia you know it's a mess in Australia. If anyone is from Australia. It's listening right now

532
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,960
Give me a call plus one two one seven nine three eight three three two

533
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,840
Because they're you know they're having a very very hot summer of course that is summer in in that part of the world right now

534
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,600
And so there's all kinds of crap going down floods and

535
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,200
Residents in northern Australia have now been warned to be where

536
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,040
Of large crocodiles and snakes as the floods sweep the area and

537
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,560
You know, it's it's true. They're like crocodiles floating by

538
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
And so

539
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,680
That's scary, but what I liked was this quote

540
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
from

541
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,160
I believe the owner of

542
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,120
The pub on the manager of the Albion hotel Donna Smith

543
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,880
Said that a four meter crocodile had been four meter four meters

544
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,600
Yeah, it's a 13-foot crocodile

545
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Had been stalking residents and dogs in the flooded Main Street

546
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,040
She also warned the town was expected to run out of beer in two days now that's what I call a crisis now

547
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,480
Now we're in real trouble. I don't care about four meter crocks with man. We're out of beer

548
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
You have feelings of inadequacy

549
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,640
Do you suffer from shyness?

550
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,000
The use sometimes wish you were more assertive if you answered yes to any of these questions

551
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,040
Ask your doctor or pharmacist about tequila

552
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,520
Tequila is the safe natural way to feel better and more confident about yourself and your actions

553
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,760
Tequila can help ease you out of your shyness and let you tell the world that you're ready and willing to do just about anything

554
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,200
You'll notice the benefits of tequila almost immediately and with a regiment of regular doses

555
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,760
You can overcome any obstacles that prevent you from living the life you want to live

556
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
shyness and awkwardness will be a thing of the past and you'll discover many talents you've never knew you had

557
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,360
Stop hiding and start living with tequila tequila may not be right for everyone

558
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,680
When the poor pregnant are nursing should not use tequila however women who wouldn't mind nursing or becoming pregnant are encouraged to try and side effects may include

559
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,240
Dizziness nausea vomiting and incarceration erotic lessfulness loss of motor control loss of clothing

560
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,600
loss of money loss of virginity delusions of grander table dancing headache dehydration dry mouth and a desire to sink

561
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Cariokia play all night rounds a strip oak or fruit or dare and make it twisted or warning the consumption of alcohol

562
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,840
They make you think you're whispering when you're not is a major factor in dancing like a retard

563
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,720
They cause you to tell your friends over and over again that you're in love with them also may cause you to think you can sing alcohol

564
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,800
They lead you believe that ex-lovers are really dying for you to telephone them at four in the morning alcohol

565
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,320
They make you think you can logically convert with members of the opposite sex without spitting it may create the illusion that you are tough or smarter

566
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:56,640
Faster and better looking than most people and it may lead you to think people are laughing with you alcohol may cause pregnancy and it also may be a major factor in getting your

567
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Ask it, so what are you waiting for?

568
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Stop hiding and start living with tequila

569
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,960
That was good straight from the drop

570
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,600
By giving you no time instead of at all

571
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,600
Till a pain is so big you feel nothing at all

572
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,520
Working class hero is something to be

573
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,520
Working class hero is something to be

574
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:56,920
They hurt you at home and they did do it school

575
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,160
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool

576
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,760
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules

577
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,360
Working class hero is something to be

578
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,440
Working class hero is something to be

579
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,520
When the tortured and scared him for 20 odd years

580
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Then they expect you to pick a career

581
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,440
When you can't really function yourself for the fear

582
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,160
Working class hero is something to be

583
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Working class hero is something to be

584
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,640
Keep your dope with religion and sex and TV

585
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,720
And you think you're so clever and classless and free

586
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,320
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

587
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,320
Working class hero is something to be

588
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,760
Working class hero is something to be

589
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,600
This room at the top they are telling you still

590
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,160
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill

591
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,760
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

592
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:18,600
Working class hero is something to be

593
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,000
Working class hero is something to be

594
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,600
If you want to be hero with just follow me

595
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,240
Plan up on the granddaddy's knee here kids I'll tell you some about the songs

596
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,680
All these songs were made in the 60s man because

597
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,960
It was a rough time then too

598
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,240
So I'm glad that we're doing that in hip hop and metal and

599
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,200
Too bad about the top 40 charts

600
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,480
George Michael did give it a good try and I give him massive props for that

601
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,440
Man, do you remember what everyone was bitching and pissing all over him for doing that video with

602
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Tony Blair acting as a or depicted as a

603
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,920
little lap dog jumping all over George Bush and it was like whoa, it's horrible. He was awake

604
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,040
In Patricia who was a young woman yeah at the time this song was released

605
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,360
Of course she was very my in fact when the Beatles did that

606
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:34,680
Worldwide love fest she was a part of that she was a part of that satellite telecast in the Netherlands if you go back and look at the footage

607
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,680
You can see her there with a golden earring hangin out being all love

608
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Very very hippy

609
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,920
But she often says she said a man if the if John Lennon were alive said you would have loved each other

610
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,720
To he was saying the same stuff talking the same way

611
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,560
And then of course now I understand why why he had Yoko because she probably didn't understand what he was talking about

612
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,040
But you got to have a real messed up chick you know if you if you're if you're if you go on the rabbit hole from time to time or

613
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:18,280
Open your eyes and really pay attention to what's going on around you and not just see it as another story on a web page or something in the newspaper or a little flash on TV

614
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,520
But actually get into it and find out what's happening

615
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,080
whoa

616
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,880
So God bless my darling wife of 22 years

617
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,120
I'll give an example here. This is from Mary Claire magazine. Why should we do a show with Mary Claire?

618
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,320
Called the mast head. It's a good show. It's said we're just a

619
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,040
Re-sign for our third season with those guys sponsored by Unilever

620
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,520
Dove

621
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,400
But it's cool. It's a ugly beddy meets Delaware's product. You should watch that show the masthead dot mevio.com

622
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,160
or just go to Mary Claire.com. They put a embed version up there

623
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
so this is from

624
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
The sex and relationship articles

625
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:04,600
Love lessons desperately seeking approval. I just got to read this to you because it's

626
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
It's so sad it's funny

627
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,880
So these are letters sent in by women with love problems

628
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,840
When my boyfriend suddenly decided that the US government had planned 9-11 to justify a war in the mid-East

629
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,360
I was alarmed but not enough to ditch him out right after all. I told myself his pension for questioning

630
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,000
Everything in his path was one of the things I loved about him. Surely he'd regain his senses soon

631
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,160
So I refrained from rolling my eyeballs when he'd say things like

632
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,480
I'm not sure the Pentagon was even hit by a plane. Those photos could have been doctored

633
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,360
And I kept my mouth shut when he'd futs around on the internet all night studying bushes family ties to the

634
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,960
Saudis and the melting temperature of steel. I even started attending weekly truth meetings in a dusty

635
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,880
church basement pretending to be very interested as he'd mutter. Yes exactly to people's rambling diet tribes.

636
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,880
Yes, I know it was nuts

637
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,840
But it wasn't the first time I'd faint interest in a subject in order to please a guy ever since high school

638
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,640
When I studied up on third level or junior dwarfs

639
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,040
So I could converse with my dungeon and dragons obsessed boyfriend. I've adopted a variety of interests that were not my own

640
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:16,360
I've taken carve maga classes. I've thrown batches of toast at screen during repeated viewings of the rocky horror picture show

641
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,800
I've gone to the death cab for cutie concerts. I've hosted marathons of movies made by the obscure Danish actors

642
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,760
I once seriously considered spending a week in the desert un-showered for burning man and the already pot smoking dude

643
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
I was dating at the time

644
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,640
I know it sounds a little pathetic, but I guess I wanted whatever guy I was dating to like me

645
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,000
If he peeked my interest, I wanted to peek his. I wanted to be the woman who got all his pop culture references

646
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,800
One carefully researched conquest and thus when I mentioned the band Genesis

647
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,000
I wanted to be a gal. His friends thought was awesome

648
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,360
Someone who inhabited his private world as comfortably as they did

649
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:02,040
That's when I decided enough was enough listening to death cab for cutie was one thing pretending that nine eleven was an inside job was another

650
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,240
Finally, I told my boyfriend. I thought his theories were insane

651
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,960
After accused me of betraying him and the people we broke up now. I just need to get rid of that prog rock collection

652
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,000
So that could have been me

653
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,080
I am a lucky bastard

654
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:30,520
But if there's a lot of people doing it maybe it's time to question if there's something going on with all that stuff

655
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,560
Here's someone who's going through the exact same process right now

656
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,560
I had and this is New York there

657
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Hey, you're there

658
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:55,320
And I offer my table and the process of Obama

659
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,800
And you know, I'd probably replied to a Z-mail by the way

660
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,440
I do tend to do that these days particularly if John and I are both on the email that sometimes we even have a little thread going on

661
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,720
I just

662
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,280
Missed to your current episode

663
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,720
The very source code and I just

664
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
It's so much for me

665
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,880
It's a

666
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,240
But even what you're saying I mean I understand

667
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,560
That that you've been for for four years and

668
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,760
You know you don't need to be fought again, but you know this is really by the way

669
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:36,120
I really appreciate E. Arthur's comments here because he's calling up and he's really laying a sole bear easy

670
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Target for ridicule which of course

671
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
Don't I don't like

672
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Especially this me

673
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,640
But I understand you know people say that there's this awakening when you start to figure things out

674
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,440
It's not really like you wake up one morning and you're like

675
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah, I see now

676
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,080
It's a process it took me about a year and

677
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,520
Gradually you start seeing things and you start paying attention really because you aren't you are in a way jolted

678
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,720
It starts with a jolt, but that that's really the beginning of

679
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,720
Figuring things out and we just spend a little bit of time moving beyond the headlines that everyone

680
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,760
accepts as the truth and the news and what's going on and it's become a

681
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,880
Disgardable product products, you know what's on the news tonight? What's on it tomorrow?

682
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,360
We even speak that way

683
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Yeah, there was nothing on the news

684
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:40,200
Once you go a little bit farther and you listen to what people are saying my favorite one by the way is

685
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
The stimulus package

686
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,040
Here is the quote from the president and the administration really from everybody

687
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:53,960
Everyone's just parroting the same thing, but it's a brilliant structure of words and I do think take things quite literally

688
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,560
When someone says that the stimulus package is meant to

689
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,400
Save or create three to four million jobs so

690
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:09,240
Again, save or create three to four million jobs everyone keeps repeating that it is meant to save or create three to four million jobs

691
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,800
Sometimes it's three sometimes it's four, but it's always save and save or create not save and create save or create now

692
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,960
if I was the

693
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,640
President of

694
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:25,400
The country if I was the boss of everybody and was a business deal the first thing I'd say is what is it three million or four million?

695
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,920
Is there a variable in there? What's the variable for that's 25% difference and then I'd say what is it

696
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:38,760
Save or create because there's a big difference between saving three million jobs and creating three million jobs

697
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,000
Because if you create three million jobs apparently you've already saved three million

698
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,040
So is it six million or

699
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,080
Could it have been a hundred million that we're gonna lose?

700
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:59,400
It's not a good and fair proposition because we're talking about eight hundred billion dollars that is supposed to save and create

701
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,720
What is it just tell me which one it is if it means save that okay then we can accept that or not

702
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,200
But it's it's a it's a huge hedge because you can always go back and say what we save three million jobs

703
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,240
They didn't go away did they well, yeah, we lost 10

704
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,120
But it would have been 13 maybe even more it's nasty

705
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,440
It's just not good business and we shouldn't accept it as taxpayers because it is our money

706
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,120
So these are the things that you start to see my friend

707
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,480
I just it's hard for me, you know

708
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Tyler saying and

709
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,640
And you know especially when I see other people like you know David believe I mean what

710
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
And her

711
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,920
For him on the show who in a while and

712
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,200
You know when I look at this what say talk about how

713
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,240
I mean what even say about how

714
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,800
You know most you pour

715
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,480
Or like you know

716
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,360
There's a glad that he's you know that Obama's

717
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,880
You know that inauguration he's in the White House. I mean yes, like Jersey Todd

718
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:13,280
Who supported Obama people who people like that. He's he chapter for masks and hash yeah hotcast

719
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
I mean well, you know what

720
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,880
Both of us guys and many other people are really warm

721
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,240
Loveable loving caring people

722
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
As far as I know them

723
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
and very personable and

724
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,120
They are very positive people and

725
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,840
That's exactly what's being played to right here

726
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,600
So I'm not you know

727
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:44,040
I don't have to go around telling everybody oh the sky is falling because it is it's just a fact and when the jobs are gone and when

728
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,720
We have all kinds of trade restrictions which means less choice of food

729
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,560
All kinds of crap that is that is likely to happen. It's not just me saying it it's experts

730
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,320
Other experts real experts

731
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,360
I saw Nancy Pelosi

732
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:10,280
The speaker of the house and she was talking about 500 million jobs will be lost 500 million there's only 300 million people in the country

733
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,560
I should look for that it was very funny

734
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
500 million

735
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,240
Like I can probably get that for you

736
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,200
This this so much stuff

737
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,760
Well, I'll me grab that that's worth it here. It is I just got a copy it over from I was gonna put that on me via today

738
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Here we go

739
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,760
Yes

740
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,600
The economic recovery package is going too fast and maybe it won't be ready by the president's day recess

741
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:51,880
Every month you do not have an economic recovery package 500 million Americans lose their jobs. I don't let's hear that one again

742
00:50:51,880 --> 00:51:00,280
Bob how many Americans lose their job economic recovery package 500 million Americans lose their jobs

743
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,560
Now I'm sure I'm sure it wasn't oversight

744
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,520
I'm sure she meant 500,000 which is not a small number either, but

745
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,640
She stands there with how many flags is she have she's got four flags. She's a four flag woman

746
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:24,120
Four flags three inputs Nancy Pelosi brings you the fact package 500 million Americans lose their jobs. I don't

747
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,200
Dork

748
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,200
All right, Arthur. He Arthur

749
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,320
to me

750
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,720
It just seems like

751
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,720
I

752
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,720
It's so much it's just so much

753
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
me to believe and maybe because I'm

754
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,360
Not 42 45 or whatever and dude and I haven't you heard more

755
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,600
You know I know the kind of experiences that you've had out of but you know I'll tell let me tell you man

756
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,560
There were friends of mine who were older significantly older when I was a young man

757
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,640
My late 20s Ben Cohen. I'll never forget

758
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,560
Um

759
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,440
George Bush senior became president and this guy basically raised me since I was 19

760
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:15,640
He had a restaurant and you know that's kind of where I went to eat because I was out of the house when I was working when I was 19

761
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,120
And I remember him his head whipped around when I said oh it looks like a pretty good president

762
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,560
And you all probably vote for him and he went like this is one of the biggest crux in the world and I'm talking about eighties, right?

763
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,560
1980s

764
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:35,320
One of the biggest crux in the world this this guy is it's all for his own benefit and he was going off on all this shit and I was like

765
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,640
Angry as Rayleigh is what I thought I had no idea

766
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,840
And some of a lot of that comes back I have to say I said oh man I remember when he told me about that crap

767
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,720
You know and I just wasn't paying attention and these are these are pre-internet days really

768
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:00,520
Bulletin board stuff, you know, we had modems, but it was not like it is today

769
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,280
And so now all that shit's flying back at me, so it's okay, you know

770
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,560
I think that we have enough communication now that the

771
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,760
That process will accelerate and you'll see so don't worry about it, you know, you don't have to

772
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,600
It's what I think what they call duality

773
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:25,240
You know where you're kind of one foot in you know in that side one foot's on the other side come on over son to the dark side

774
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
We've been waiting for you

775
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
I just

776
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
I don't know maybe it's just gonna take me time

777
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,360
It's a preview of everything you're saying

778
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,160
Maybe

779
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,160
Maybe it is but you know

780
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,360
Anyways

781
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,080
Thank you guys for the show and keep up

782
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,880
What shit, sorry about that

783
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,800
All right, man. Thank you so much for calling. I appreciate it. Yeah

785
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,480
When I did the food bar I kept it and I want to play it for you baby

786
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,120
God, I love this song

787
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,120
I've not heard of live version

788
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,120
Because of course radio won't play that

789
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,080
Crazy I would break format that would be horrible

790
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,320
How long is this been going on and say so Chuck eat you sir

Well, they're ain't any use you're too late

Oh, how long

There's been no way long

837
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
How long

838
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,700
There's been no way long

839
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
How long

840
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,700
There's been no way long

841
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,700
How long is this before and long

842
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,700
Oh, how long

843
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,700
There's been no way long

844
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,700
Yeah, beautiful

845
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,700
You know, come on

846
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,700
Everybody, come on

847
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,700
There's been no way long

848
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,700
There's been no way long

849
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,700
I don't...

850
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,700
There's been no way long

851
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,700
There's been no way long

852
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,700
I don't...

853
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,700
There's been no way long

854
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:33,700
Thank you very much.

855
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:39,700
Thank you, people. Fantastic.

856
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
Yeah.

857
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,700
Hey, live. How long has this been going on?

858
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,700
Of course, Paul Carrick.

859
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,700
Who is Paul Carrick on vocals?

860
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,700
Fantastic, shit.

861
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,700
Alright, so it's kind of messed up because I'm just seeing the chat

862
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,700
is starting to perk up a little bit.

863
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,700
We got folks waking up in Australia.

864
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:07,700
We've got someone on from Milan, the stream is jam packed.

865
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,700
You know what I'm thinking?

866
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,700
Because Christina, as you know, is here with the boyfriend.

867
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,700
And she just cooked dinner and it smells fantastic.

868
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,700
And she cleaned up the kitchen.

869
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,700
And she's really made a job of it.

870
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,700
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to stop the,

871
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:26,700
the DSC recording and pick it up after dinner.

872
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,700
What I'll do is I'll turn on some music.

873
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,700
So y'all can enjoy it on the stream or not.

874
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:36,700
And come back in, I don't know, like 40, 45 minutes.

875
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,700
And I'll continue.

876
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
Cause I do have more to talk about.

877
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,700
So keep the stream alive.

878
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,700
I'm going to pause the recording right now.

879
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,700
Alright, we're back.

880
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:49,700
Those of you listening to the recorded version of Debbie source code 820.

881
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
Well, you missed a good dinner.

882
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,700
Oh, yeah.

883
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,700
And played some tunes.

884
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
Played a lot of who.

885
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:01,700
I had to ring out the mission control is next to the kitchen in the curry terrace.

886
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,700
So I can just keep the doors open.

887
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,700
I could hear the music going like, okay.

888
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,700
Maybe a little bit too much.

889
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,700
Who?

890
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
But I can't say.

891
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,700
It was on shuffle.

892
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,700
There you go.

893
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,700
Chicken.

894
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,700
Actually is what she made.

895
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,700
Chicken mashed potatoes, peas, wonderful salad.

896
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
Dexter brought over some wine.

897
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,700
Which I think he bought with my money.

898
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,700
Okay.

899
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,700
Let's see.

900
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:30,700
Oh, I want to play this because this is one of our.

901
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,700
True.

902
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,700
Chuck listeners who's calling in reports.

903
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Adam here at Fortland.

904
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,700
I am back from my trip to Pakistan and I wanted to.

905
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Provided note on the GSA the global security agency.

906
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,700
I have continued to Google this.

907
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,700
Oh, yeah.

908
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,700
This is.

909
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,700
So Eric when he went to Pakistan.

910
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,700
He was questioned.

911
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,700
I believe.

912
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,700
I think he said it was questioned or.

913
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,700
At least the security at the airport was the GSA, which.

914
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,700
No one could find it.

915
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,700
There was some.

916
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,700
He like private security companies that do have worldwide services.

917
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,700
But it didn't seem like that was it because it would.

918
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,700
You would have to think it's a homeland security department or division.

919
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,700
So here's the update.

920
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,700
Cannot find it.

921
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,700
But I know what I saw.

922
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,700
But what I did not see.

923
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,700
Was a badge.

924
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,700
There was no badge on the uniform.

925
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:25,700
It was a blue uniform with a embroidered logo that's in GSA and the left breast.

926
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,700
Pocket and on the back and said global security.

927
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,700
Either agency or administration.

928
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,700
I'm not exactly sure.

929
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,700
Yeah.

930
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,700
That's.

931
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,700
That was in the JFK.

932
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,700
Check in area.

933
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,700
At the Pakistan PIA Airlines.

934
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,700
The person who checked my passport, essentially.

935
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,700
Hey, two points about Pakistan.

936
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,700
First of all, Pakistan is a police state.

937
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,700
Yeah.

938
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,700
It's amazing.

939
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,700
There are military police everywhere.

940
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,700
You can't drive 20 K without going through some kind of a guard check point.

941
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,700
If you want to go into certain shopping areas.

942
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,700
They're looking with mirrors underneath your car.

943
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,700
There.

944
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,700
You know, I'd like to have that job.

945
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,700
Look with mirrors underneath your dress.

946
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,700
There are metal detectors at shopping malls.

947
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,700
It is a police state.

948
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,700
And we do not want that in the United States.

949
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,700
No, sir.

950
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,700
And then lastly, I also thought it was interesting.

951
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,700
The people I was staying with.

952
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,700
They are the lead of the country.

953
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,700
And you know what they have.

954
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,700
They have really high quality food.

955
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,700
They control their food source.

956
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,700
So much so that they didn't like the milk.

957
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,700
They were getting from the local market.

958
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,700
They bought their own cow.

959
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,700
With the codex, Elmatera is coming down.

960
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,700
It's interesting to see the elite in all countries.

961
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,700
Really taking care to feed themselves and their families.

962
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,700
Yeah.

963
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,700
Only the best.

964
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,700
Except.

965
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,700
Well, that's it for today.

966
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,700
Big hair.

967
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,700
Hope you win.

968
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
I had to be back in the USA.

969
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,700
Welcome.

970
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,700
Hi, buddy.

971
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,700
Welcome home.

972
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,700
Thank you so much.

973
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,700
Appreciate the update.

974
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,700
So maybe it is that global security agency that people sent me the link to, which has.

975
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,700
It has different offices.

976
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,700
I think the Netherlands is one of the main offices.

977
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,700
G.

978
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,700
Ah, the stranger things seem.

979
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
The more they seem like.

980
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Serendipity.

981
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,700
So here's a, here's a link that I think bears.

982
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,700
Worthiness of discussing.

983
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,700
Or report, I should say.

984
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,700
Now, I don't know much about bribar dot com.

985
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,700
So I have no idea.

986
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,700
And I'm not sure about the sources on this.

987
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,700
But if it took place at Davos or devil.

988
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,700
I'm hoping there's video of it.

989
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,700
Check President.

990
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,700
Vuckloff Claus took aim at climate change campaigner.

991
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,700
El Gore on Saturday in Davos.

992
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,700
In a frontal attack on the science of global warming.

993
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,700
This is highly interesting.

994
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:56,700
I don't think there's any global warming to the 67 year old liberal who's country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.

995
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,700
I don't see this statistical data for that.

996
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,700
I'm starting to like the gentleman from the Czech Republic.

997
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,700
Referring to the former US vice president who attended Davos this year.

998
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:12,700
He added, I'm very sorry that some people like El Gore are not ready to listen to the competing theories.

999
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,700
I do listen to them.

1000
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,700
Hallelujah.

1001
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,700
My ball brother.

1002
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,700
Environmentalism and the global warming alarmism is challenging our freedom.

1003
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,700
El Gore is an important person in this movement.

1004
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,700
Yes.

1005
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,700
And I think that this guy is on a very good track with the way he's choosing his words.

1006
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,700
I hope that these are verbatim quotes.

1007
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,700
Because if anything, we need to stop the the.

1008
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,700
The exactly what he says, the challenges to our freedom because of this,

1009
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,700
which is exactly where this is headed.

1010
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,700
And which is really my main gripe about against all this.

1011
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,700
People say, oh, you know, you talk bad about greenies that greenies are terrorists.

1012
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,700
I've never said that.

1013
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,700
I don't even think I've used the word greenies.

1014
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,700
John Devore, I use the word greenies.

1015
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,700
Go, go, pastor him, go Twitter him.

1016
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,700
I'm just being logical.

1017
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,700
I'm all for making the world a better place and doing more for the environment.

1018
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,700
But I don't think I should be taxed for everything.

1019
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,700
That involves CO2.

1020
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:28,700
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, he said that there was that he was more worried about the reaction to the perceived dangers than the consequences.

1021
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:36,700
I'm afraid that the current crisis will be misused for radically constraining the functioning of the markets and market economy all around the world.

1022
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,700
Exactly right, which is exactly what the stimulus package is all about.

1023
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:45,700
All this green stuff that's in there.

1024
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:51,700
Which surely we need, but I don't think it's the way to solve the financial economic crisis.

1025
01:05:51,700 --> 01:06:01,700
I read somewhere that there's $2 billion in there to find out if capping and storing CO2 was possible.

1026
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,700
I thought people were doing it already.

1027
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,700
They don't even know if it works yet.

1028
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,700
That's pretty outrageous.

1029
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,700
Class makes no secret of his climate change skepticism.

1030
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,700
He is also a fierce critic of the European Union.

1031
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:25,700
And as branded the world's top panel of climate experts, the UN's IPCC, a smug monopoly.

1032
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,700
Oh man, 67 years old.

1033
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:32,700
I hope he lives to see 68 because they're going to kill him if he keeps talking like that.

1034
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,700
Here's a guy that matters.

1035
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,700
Maybe they're just going to belittle him.

1036
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,700
Crazy Czech president who happens to have the presidency, the Czech Republic,

1037
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,700
now the presidency of the European Union.

1038
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,700
Good thing.

1039
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,700
Well, keep your eye on this guy.

1040
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,700
It's certainly something that is worthy of some research.

1041
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,700
Don't you agree.

1042
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,700
Let me just check through this.

1043
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:54,700
What are we doing now?

1044
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,700
We'll over an hour.

1045
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,700
Okay.

1046
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
It should be just about time.

1047
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,700
She's okay.

1048
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,700
That's a critic hunch.

1049
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,700
What's next for the world?

1050
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,700
It was the first post.

1051
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,700
Oh man.

1052
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,700
I don't want to just reject this story.

1053
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
I don't want to go out on a bummer.

1054
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,700
This first post.co.uk.

1055
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,700
That's pretty good.

1056
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,700
They got some good writers there.

1057
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,700
Hold on.

1058
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,700
Tuner is twittering me with more Czech love with a link.

1059
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,700
Ah, okay.

1060
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:29,700
I can see the title already as the page is loading and building the lower house of the Czech parliament.

1061
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,700
I guess this has is as of today.

1062
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,700
Has postponed a vote on the European Union's reform treaty.

1063
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,700
Excellent.

1064
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:41,700
The Czech Republic, which holds the EU rotating presidency is the last country to vote on

1065
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,700
the so-called Lisbon Treaty.

1066
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Well, let's see what this article says.

1067
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,700
The vote was delayed at the request of law makers from Prime Minister Mirick

1068
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:53,700
Topalonix, conservative civic democratic party, which is split over the issue.

1069
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,700
The Lisbon Treaty document seeks to streamline decision making in the block.

1070
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,700
All member states need to approve it to take effect.

1071
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,700
So far, 24 of the EU's 27 nations have ratified the document.

1072
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,700
Irish voters dealt it a blow when they rejected it in a referendum last June.

1073
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,700
A second poll is planned for later this year.

1074
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,700
How does this bullshit?

1075
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,700
They have to have this thing done because that's how their new banking system,

1076
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,700
their new financial, one world bank and eventually one world government.

1077
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,700
That's how it.

1078
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,700
It's all in those documents.

1079
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,700
That's all the shit that that's why they needed this.

1080
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,700
That's why they pushed for it so hard.

1081
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:34,700
And that's why they rammed it through 24 of the 27 member state parliaments.

1082
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,700
And got it ratified.

1083
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,700
The Polish parliament has approved the treaty, but the president has yet to sign it.

1084
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,700
So that's a game he's playing there.

1085
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,700
I'm sure that has to do with it.

1086
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:48,700
Oh, they're going to drag president Obama into this for sure.

1087
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,700
Because they're going to say, well, man, get rid of those missiles in Poland.

1088
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:54,700
And then maybe the guy will sign up.

1089
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,700
This is just a bunch of gangs and thugs.

1090
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,700
And it's not against you and I.

1091
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,700
I don't hate Iranians.

1092
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,700
They're paying into beautiful fucking people.

1093
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,700
And they got iPods.

1094
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,700
But more do you want?

1095
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,700
Now it's the idiot to run the place.

1096
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,700
And we've got the idiots in the UK.

1097
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,700
British people are lovely, fantastic.

1098
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,700
They drink a lot.

1099
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Good on them.

1100
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,700
But they're completely ruled by

1101
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,700
this bunch of dickheads.

1102
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:31,700
And you notice that no one's complaining about the issues they're complaining about.

1103
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,700
We're complaining about the shit that they've made wrong.

1104
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:39,700
Just thugs and bullies worldwide, global bullies.

1105
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,700
And every single one of them's got some kind of finance here behind them.

1106
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,700
And you think that the doctor evil concept is wrong?

1107
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,700
No, man.

1108
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,700
I bet you they even have the white pussycat.

1109
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,700
Okay, what should we do?

1110
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,700
I don't have time to play a home.

1111
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,700
I'll play one more song.

1112
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,700
We'll get out of here.

1113
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,700
All right, hold on.

1114
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,700
I'm going to play this one just because it's such an incredibly pretty song.

1115
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,700
Oh, man.

1116
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,700
They don't make music like this anymore.

1117
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,700
Ah.

1118
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,700
Dennis, the young and sticks.

1119
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,700
Babe.

1120
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,700
Oh, man.

1121
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:49,700
Oh, man.

1122
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,700
Oh, man.

1123
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,700
Oh, man.

1124
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,700
Oh, man.

1125
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,700
Oh, man.

1126
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,700
Oh, man.

1127
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,700
Oh, man.

1128
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,700
Oh, man.

1129
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,700
Oh, man.

1130
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,700
Oh, man.

1131
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,700
Oh, man.

1132
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,700
Oh, man.

1133
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,700
Oh, man.

1134
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,700
Oh, man.

1135
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:03,700
Oh, man.

1136
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,700
Oh, man.

1137
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,700
Oh, man.

1138
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,700
Oh, man.

1139
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,700
Oh, man.

1140
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,700
Oh, man.

1141
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,700
Oh, man.

1142
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,700
Oh, man.

1143
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,700
Oh, man.

1144
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,700
Oh, man.

1145
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,700
Oh, man.

1146
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,700
Oh, man.

1147
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,700
Oh, man.

1148
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,700
Oh, man.

1149
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,700
Oh, man.

1150
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,700
Oh, man.

1151
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,700
Oh, man.

1152
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Oh, man.

1153
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,700
Oh, wher吓a.

1154
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,700
Oh, man.

1155
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,700
Oh, man.

1156
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,700
Oh, man.

1157
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,700
Oh, man.

1158
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,700
Oh, man.

1159
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,700
Oh, man.

1160
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,700
Oh, man.

1161
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,700
Oh, man.

1162
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,700
Oh, man.

1163
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,700
Oh, man.

1164
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,700
Oh, man.

1165
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,700
Oh, man.

1166
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,700
Oh, man.

1167
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,700
Oh.

1168
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,700
Oh, man.

1169
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,700
Oh, man.

1170
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,700
Oh, man.

1171
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:48,700
Give me the courage and the strength I need

1172
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:55,700
Please believe that it's true

1173
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,700
Baby, I love you

1174
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:33,700
You know it's you, babe

1175
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:38,700
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough

1176
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:44,700
Feel like it may go, you know it's you, babe

1177
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:50,700
Give me the courage and the strength I need

1178
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:57,700
Please believe that it's true

1179
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,700
Baby, I love you

1180
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:15,700
Baby, I believe in I'll say it once again

1181
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:21,700
Somehow try to smile

1182
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:27,700
I know the feeling we're trying to forget

1183
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:32,700
If only for a while

1184
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:39,700
You'll be lonely without you

1185
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:45,700
And I'll need your love to see me through

1186
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,700
Please believe me

1187
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,700
My heart is in your hands

1188
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,700
I'll be missing you

1189
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,700
Oh, Aaron Burnett

1190
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,700
Aaron

1191
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,700
Baby, come back

1192
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,700
Baby, please

1193
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,700
We've got a saver

1194
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,700
We've got a saver

1195
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,700
I know I'm in a melancholy

1196
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,700
Sad mood

1197
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
We must save Aaron Burnett

1198
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,700
From the evil elites

1199
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,700
We must bring her over to the good side

1200
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,700
Bring her to the light

1201
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,700
Bring her towards the white

1202
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,700
Please help me save Aaron

1203
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,700
Oh, all right

1204
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,700
I'm going to try and do tomorrow

1205
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,700
No agenda taping with John CD

1206
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,700
And then Friday of Fubar Friday

1207
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:44,700
Which will the timing will be very dependent upon the travel plans of the lady Patricia

1208
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,700
And wrote in weather conditions may affect your your mileage and performance

1209
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,700
As you can understand

1210
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,700
So until then my friends use your freedom very, very wisely

1211
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,700
Save Aaron Burnett from the evil elites

1212
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,700
And live your life with passion

1213
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,700
Another fine medial presentation

1214
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,700
Stick it in your ear
