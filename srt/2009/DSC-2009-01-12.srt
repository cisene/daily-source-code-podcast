1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 816.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To the next generation video contenting my ears.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't need lost eating greens.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm flying into this church.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm guessing it's a battle curry.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
For our Monday!

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, all the times I've come.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're here for time, let it go.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Season's don't fear the reason.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Not to the wind, the sun of the rain.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We could be like this.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Come on, baby.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We'll take my head.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We'll be able to fly.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Don't fear the reason.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Not to the wind, the sun of the rain.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, all the times I've come.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, all the times I've come.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Come on, baby.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Call the time, let it go.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're here for time, let it go.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're here for time, let it go.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We're here for time, let it go.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're here for time, let it go.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come on, baby.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Call the time, let it go.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We'll be able to fly.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't fear the reason.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Not to the wind, the sun of the rain.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, all the times I've come.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Season's don't fear the reason.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not to the wind, the sun of the rain.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go!

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're here for time, let it go.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We're here for time, let it go.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We're here for time, let it go.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We're here for time, let it go.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're here for time, let it go.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're here for time, let it go.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're here for time, let it go.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're here for time, let it go.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're here for time, let it go.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We're here for time, let it go.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We're here for time, let it go.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go, we're here for time, let it go.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Give the last night I said yes, and if you stay as you can long,

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't lose all the night away in the face,

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you can't lose one of his feelings,

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But then you still want to meet me,

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I'll be fine.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on, let it be, let's not let it be.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She ran through it,

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I'll be fine.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're the fact that you said it,

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Keep that night,

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll be fine.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll be fine.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll be fine.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Come on, let it be.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And just a little bit more cowbell.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Daily source code episode number eight hundred and sixteen,

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Coming new from the curry terrace in southwest London,

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
In the United Kingdom,

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In the eastern part of Gitmo Nation,

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The bluer is to call,

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't fear the repart.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't really fear him,

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But he's out there, that's for sure.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know, the past two weeks have been so full barred,

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When it comes down to production and getting stuff done,

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I just felt I really needed to do a full on full bar show.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just couldn't eat it out on Friday.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I had to work ahead as I mentioned on eight hundred fifteen,

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Which was one was that Tuesday, Wednesday last week.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had to work one day ahead in the production schedule,

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I've successfully done that over the weekend.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Of course, a couple other things going wrong with the new set up,

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Including, well, the biggest problem that just really,

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I didn't understand how, how was happening.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm now recording on audio hijack pro,

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Instead of recording everything multi track in Ableton Live,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And then usually, you know, that records either wave or AFF,

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Whatever it is.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And then I'd, you know, just spin it, I think it was wave.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, AFF.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it's been that down to MP3 using iTunes.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I was just using audio hijack pro.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've tried constant bit rate, tried all different versions,

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And too many problems.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
People literally could not listen to the entire show

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Because of the timecode problems that have been all messed up.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So now I'm recording this in high quality AFF.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's about 10 megs a minute.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And, and I'll use iTunes to add the show notes,

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
album art, and to compress it down to MP3.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Brand new music from the pretenders.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mine have seen this on the video today over the weekend.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Got some free tickets for the pretenders for you.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just keep it here on the source code.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now you're home and gank your boot of please.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Pretty happy little resonance begging on a knees.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Illusion fills my head like an empty can.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's been a million items living the same name.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, yeah, everything dry.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They're up on through the vein.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Whoa, it's making way back to the hot again.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
By the way, look fantastic.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Can you hold boots of Chinese birthday?

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have written Krishna, I have written vomit too.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Going there, I'm still in love with you.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I see you in the birds and in the trees.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's why they call me Krishna Mai.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They're everywhere.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Whoa, everyone through the vein.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Whoa, it's making way back to the hot again.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm found.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Look fantastic.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Can you hold boots of Chinese birthday?

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Woo-hoo!

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, hey, hey, hey.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Woo, dang it!

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Fuck it, Thomas, we should tolerate the people and the things that make me want to hate

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
All I have I live must must be on me There's season begins human pageantry

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Jesus Christ came down here as a living man If you can live a life of virtue, then I hope I can

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
One, two others, you would have a turn I'm back here and repeat until you learn

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Under, oh, yeah, the red dot Time comes through the veins, oh, it's made the twain

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Back in the heart again, and ever it does That living's life of a change, goes with its life

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
One, ten, for nothing, and proud of the way you look fantastic in your boots of Johnny's place

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, oh, brand new from the pretenders boots of Chinese plastic

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We just got the video from their record label, Shangrelong music along with the MP3

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I believe it's going up on the pod save music network, at least I sure hope so

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because it's just awesome and they're hitting the road the end of this month

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think US tour and the record label has given me a couple of tickets to give away

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now I've also promoted this on the video today

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But we're keeping it real honest and fair doesn't matter where you

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000

Hey Adam, Eric's a Portland

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Your show has really been sucking ass back

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The comment thing is not working

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You know, I know you're experimenting and that's cool

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The one thing I didn't want to

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's what my mom always said. It's okay to experiment honey. Don't worry about it

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Say that that is different and and cool about about the shows

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Even though they are a little scattered

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Is your compassion for the people that are writing and getting hurt

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Really comes through when it's less staged

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Podcast and you're your passion for for the issues you're talking about

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Really come through so in that regard

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I would say it's a plus plus but

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For a whole man the production body is down

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So thank thanks

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Take care I'll be waiting for season

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Alright, yeah, thank you

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to work with the phone yet

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I mean what I've done now is I've just unmuted everyone in the conference bridge

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I'm not sending the music back only my voice

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So people can talk amongst themselves and I'd much much

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Much more prefer you listen to the

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Listen to the stream because the quality is much better

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And of course if you log in to talk shoe then you also have a chat room there

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Which people are using and

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And you know, I could see who's on and I could of course I could call it you in any moment

168
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So be prepared

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's the football Monday and it's in 1816

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How about a little bit of water sound everybody

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Some feel specter

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think it's a good idea

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
To the soul

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And if I had to get in the car

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Never let you go

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So once you say you love me

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll make you show

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We'll make the turn there pick

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Every place we go

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So fun to play

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We'll make the turn there pick

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We'll make the turn there pick

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We'll make the turn there pick

We'll make the turn there pick

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We'll make the turn there pick

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We'll make the turn there pick

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We'll make the turn there pick

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We'll make the turn there pick

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We'll make the turn there pick

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll make the turn there pick

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We'll make the turn there pick

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We'll make the turn there pick

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We'll make the turn there pick

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We'll make the turn there pick

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We'll make the turn there pick

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We'll make the turn there pick

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We'll make the turn there pick

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We'll make the turn there pick

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We'll make the turn there pick

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We'll make the turn there pick

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We'll make the turn there pick

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We'll make the turn there pick

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We'll make the turn there pick

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We'll make the turn there pick

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We'll make the turn there pick

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We'll make the turn there pick

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We'll make the turn there pick

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We'll make the turn there pick

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We'll make the turns there pick

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We'll make the turn there pick

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We'll make the turn there pick

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Baby, now, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Baby, now, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, beautiful love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love,

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Gilling her on a mistrial hung jury 10 the two. We don't know if it was 10 who wanted to convict him or 10 who thought he should go

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,120
Scott free, but still got honor the man's work. What an amazing sound. That is Ron. That's me, my baby

219
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,560
Daily source code 816 where food bar, which means they'll be kind of low on talking about oh

220
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,400
You know the typical things how the new world order wants to kill us off and

221
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,120
And roll out some tunes. I like him hope you do

222
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,960
The radio the other day. I thought I got to share this with a chuckle. I didn't say Madison Lighthouse

223
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
From like the 60s I think

224
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,900
Talks kind of easy and people say she's crazy and had lots of missed the read

225
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh

226
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
And nobody knows

227
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Something about it and all in mine

228
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,400
It's a feeling that's fine and I just gotta say hey

229
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Really gotta make it this well, and it's working so well

230
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm a lucky fella and I just gotta tell her that I love her and let's meet

231
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Because love proves when I'm almost there it goes and nobody knows

232
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
What an amazing light

233
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,400
There's something about it and all in mine

234
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,400
It's a feeling that's fine and I just gotta say hey

235
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Really gotta make it this well, and it's working so well

236
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,400
And I can't get away

237
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm a lucky fella and I just gotta tell her that I love her and let's meet

238
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Because love proves when I'm almost there it goes and nobody knows

239
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,400
And the cool thing about those songs from back in the days

240
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,400
This is short, can play 10 of them, play five new ones

241
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Yeah, I'll put that in the show now, is that it's in Lighthouse, my love rose when my rose married goes

242
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
My love is growing as my speed

243
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,400
All right, again, I'm not sending the music into the conference bridge

244
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,400
If anyone wants that change, I'm certainly happy to listen to a vote on that one

245
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
A couple of interesting articles that I did run across that I do want to share with you

246
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,400
And I love it when mainstream articles come out with the stuff that we've been talking about here

247
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,400
And just kind of confirms the thinking of the chuckleheads

248
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,400
This is from Bloomberg, and of course, you're seeing a lot, or I'm seeing a lot of articles

249
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
And I'm seeing many of them on the drop.au slash daily source code about the change

250
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,400
That President-elect Obama has promised us and well, this is a very tongue-in-cheek article

251
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,400
But interesting on the less Obama at the headline reads, Obama to maintain practice of naming donors to ambassador posts

252
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:46,400
So, and donors is kind of a misnomer, because there were several hundred, but a couple of really big what we call bundlers

253
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,400
And the way these guys work, and they did do it for all campaigns, by the way, for all political parties

254
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Is they gather all of the individual checks from hundreds, thousands, sometimes thousands of people

255
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
And then they hand them in, and here's a bundle of money

256
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,400
And as a reward, it appears, and this is something that's been going on for many, many years

257
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,400
In fact, there was a time in the Netherlands when a new government was coming in, where I actually thought to myself, hey, this is a cool opportunity

258
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
If I help to get this party elected, you know, I can get an ambassador ship out of it

259
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I think ambassador curry has a nice ring to it

260
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,400
And of course, well anyway, so here's a bit of the article, President-elect Obama will uphold at least one of Washington's old ways

261
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
The appointment of campaign donors to plum ambassador ships

262
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:42,400
And it goes on to tell you more about some of these bundlers or these donors, and of course, which, which other presidents have done this

263
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
And which is just about every single one of them, and the cool thing, of course, is that

264
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
I mean, there's some awesome ambassador, I should have gotten into this game, man

265
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Ambassador ships to Rome and the Vatican are highly sought by Italian American and Catholic donors

266
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
And of course, the Bahamas is always a popular one

267
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Yeah, that's some change for you, right there

268
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Very happy to see over the weekend that the shoe throwing name has really, really caught on globally

269
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Tons of protests, we're talking hundreds of thousands

270
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Friends, France, I should say, and not even too far from here

271
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
SW6 Southwest London in Kensington, on the Kensington High Street

272
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Thousands of protesters

273
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Throwing shoes, protesting outside the Israeli embassy, which apparently is on the Kensington High Street or nearby

274
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Unfortunately, a Starbucks was a, was a, a trashed in the process

275
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,400
But people are pissed off, they are very pissed off, and what's interesting is that

276
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,400
It's coming from two sides, we have the pro Israeli and the anti Israeli fractions

277
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,400
But I think everyone is kind of saying the same thing, this has to stop, this is ludicrous

278
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Children dying, sitting in dirt with their dead parents around them, it's just, it's, ah, you, you want to talk about football

279
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,400
That's massively football, and really, really, I'm so happy that the protesters are catching on

280
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,400
But there's not a lot of pre-information about them, I wish I could tap in and help organize

281
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
And, and shit, if I knew when these things were taking place, I'd be out there myself

282
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I'd love to go out with my eye river and get some, you know, get some impressions for you, play them on the Charlie

283
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
And I think I got a shoe or two, I'd like to send in someone's direction as well

284
00:20:36,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I

285
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:36,400
could send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in something's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's turn, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like to send in someone's turn outside, I'd like to send in someone's direction, I'd like

286
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Attention number one

287
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Let me pause. I was gonna say Tina Turner

288
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Since we've been together

289
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
You forever

290
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
You were the one

291
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
You were the one

292
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
You were the best

293
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Hi, Tina Turner. Let's stay together. It's answer number one

294
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Yeah, it's came out

295
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
No, wait. This is answer number two

296
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Is it?

297
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
We'll head party right

298
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I want to know, can we feel it too?

299
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Answer number two, cameo and candy

300
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
And this

301
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah

302
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I've got it

303
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
But I keep those things

304
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Last night, did you say my life?

305
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Last night, did you say my life?

306
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Oh, the rap is great

307
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Last night, did you say my life?

308
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
From the song

309
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Here comes

310
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Oh, that's a problem

311
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I can't say

312
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Because I can do it in the mix

313
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
And if your man gives you trouble, then you will go down the level

314
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
No, you don't say

315
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I say my life has answered number three

316
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
And that concludes

317
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
It says number 155

318
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Yo

319
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
So Adam

320
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Yeah

321
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
How did you do this week?

322
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Well, worse than I expected actually

323
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I was sure to have said Tina Turner and missed those two

324
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I got half right on Camille

325
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
And so three stars on total including indeed last night of DJ's

326
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400

340
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
In Ho Young Pulla.com

341
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,400
J-N-P-O-L-C-T-D-A-C-A

342
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Fantastic

343
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Unfortunately, no one participated on the phone

344
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I, you know, and now that I think about it

345
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
There's no way you could

346
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Because I forgot to turn the music up

347
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
And the music came too late on the screen

348
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
It's like a 15 or 20 second delay

349
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Duh

350
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
All right

351
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Next time

352
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Let me see

353
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
What does Melmo say here?

354
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Cannot listen to the stream

355
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
And being the chat room

356
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Because there's too much delay

357
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Between the two

358
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So I, you know, why don't I just turn up

359
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
The, I'm just going to turn up the music

360
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
On the, on the chat room

361
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
So you guys have that

362
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Might as well

363
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
And thank you very much

364
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
On Pulla.com

365
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Who I see is also on, on the conference

366
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
You should put the whole rap in, y'all

367
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I know the whole thing

368
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
It's like, and there's a problem that I can't fix

369
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Because I can do it in the mix

370
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
And if you manage to treble

371
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
then you move it and the doubling

372
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
you don't let it treble

373
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
you brain

374
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Because away, go, the treble

375
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
down the drain

376
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I said away, goes

377
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
It's like Engage

378
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
It's like

379
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
I don't care about nothing

380
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Man

381
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400

419
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,940
Afroman world

420
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,560
God

421
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,360
Hi guy hi. I haven't feeling that that was pretty much the original oficial recording

422
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,520
Yeah, I did turn into a mow. I hear the girls next door. You know, I'm on the ground floor now

423
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,560
Which is the room with the bars in front of the window at the front of the house? Very typical for Victorian

424
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,560
And the only other room on this floor is the kitchen which is actually phenomenal because I can just walk right next door

425
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,520
It's almost like a commissary for the studio complex just just fucking love it

426
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,800
Hey, I got some feedback. I want to share with you on this

427
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,760
Fubar Monday edition of the source code. Yeah, I just it's Gaza Strip thing

428
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,040
Yeah, I went to hear King of Jordan speak at the commonwealth club a while ago and

429
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
He said to understand the middle east

430
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
You must first understand the God's strip

431
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,920
So you know, I don't know who cast the first stone in this whole turmoil and the me you know

432
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,280
By now it doesn't really matter

433
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,440
But when I find the lying corporate media lettuce, you know, speed and spewing this prop again to be yes

434
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,880
I find myself going back and just counting how many times the mindless drone reading the you know the telecom drone at TV

435
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,000
Saying the words Israel the words

436
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,400
Well, how much and the word Palestine and you know and after I do that it becomes so

437
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Clear

438
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
What's life? I'm supposed to be on at least in this country

439
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,520
Anyway, so yeah, just just some thoughts I was having but no

440
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,520
I still don't as a king of doll Abdullah whatever his name was told media to do

441
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,680
I have no idea what's really going on in the fertile crescent region, but you know what?

442
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm still researching it. I'm still trying to figure it out. All right man happy new year

443
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Great. Oh my hope you went peace. Yeah, love you to

444
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,280
Yeah, it's so there's a couple things going on here what I've that I've been able to see first of all

445
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,040
the United Nations Security Council which consists of I believe 15 members

446
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,680
signed a resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire

447
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,200
And he just got a love it. This has not been widely reported

448
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,680
So they take all this time in trouble

449
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,200
Condolisa Rice who is still the secretary of state

450
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Of course, soon to be replaced by Hillary Clinton what what an abortion that's going to be what a disaster

451
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
She is a disaster

452
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,960
All right, so she'll be even Patricia said she said what is this? Why is this club always in all these positions? And the reason why you know

453
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,680
What I do I have that here? Yeah, hold on a second. I got to grab the newspaper. You're going to you got to freak out when you hear this all up

454
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,320
This is

455
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,840
Front of the financial times today. Yeah, this is great

456
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,000
Little picture there of Tony Blair former prime minister Tony Blair above

457
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:16,360
Is reemerging as a possible choice to be the European Union's first full-time president after four crisis

458
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,600
Reinforce the argument for having a high profile personality in the job

459
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,200
According to officials and diplomats the performance of Nicholas or cozy Francis president during

460
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,600
It's his spell in charge of the you last year has strengthened the hand of those

461
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,000
I want a big name so the deal is they really want to get this

462
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,480
Lisbon treaty pushed through and they're going to do another vote September October in Ireland because no doesn't mean no in the European Union

463
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,880
Oh, no, you just got to go back and ask them again

464
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
So when the time comes I'll be

465
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:55,960
Promoting the no again and also the Czech Republic as far as I understand is not ratified the Lisbon treaty

466
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:03,400
But if it does pass then you will have an unelected president that will be appointed somehow through some mystery Starfleet command council

467
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
And they want to put Tony Blair in that spot

468
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,680
The guy who were sat together with the Gordon Brown fucked everything up in the United Kingdom

469
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Anyway

470
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,320
It's clear that

471
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,480
This is being used as a proxy against Iran you watch and of course the United States did not

472
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,760
Sign the resolution as the only member of the security council

473
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,640
It goes because what if they know this what you think you can

474
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Don't say

475
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,960
Where you're going to regret

476
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,680
Don't let fire rush to your hand

477
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,080
I thought the accusation before

478
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,080
And now who got to take any more

479
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Believe me, the sudden you're right

480
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,280
It's some of the lies worth believing

481
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,280
I am behind the sky looking at you

482
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
I can read your mind

483
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,000
I am the maker of rules dealing with fools

484
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I can keep you blind

485
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,000
And I don't need to see any more to know that

486
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I can read your mind

487
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I can read your mind

488
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I can read your mind

489
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I can read your mind

490
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I can read your mind

491
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,760
Don't be false and you should be high

492
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,480
Don't cry, I am changing my mind

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,800
So find a new fool like before

494
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Because I ain't got a little bit of a belief

495
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,240
So not the lies worth all of the signs are to see me

496
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,680
I am behind the sky looking at you

497
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
I can read your mind

498
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,960
I am the maker of rules dealing with fools

499
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
I can keep you blind

500
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,960
And I don't need to see any more to know that

501
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
I can read your mind

502
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I can read your mind

503
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
I can read your mind

504
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,960
I can read your mind

505
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,960
I am the maker of rules dealing with fools

506
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
I can read your mind

507
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,960
I am the maker of rules dealing with fools

508
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
I can keep you blind

509
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I can see any more to know that

510
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,960
I can read your mind

511
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I can read your mind

512
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,960
I can read your mind

513
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,960
I can read your mind

514
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Alan Parsons projects the eye and the sky

515
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Which is exactly how this war is being fought in Gaza

516
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
By the way, they got drones

517
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Running overhead there was a link on the drop

518
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Drop.io slash daily source code

519
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Which had a live webcam from Gaza

520
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
You could hear the booms and the distance of the explosions

521
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,960
And you could hear the drones flying overhead

522
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
And the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces

523
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Has a YouTube channel

524
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Believe it or not, something else

525
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Everything I do is source from the drop

526
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Every song, everything, it's all coming from the audience out there

527
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,960
And you look at this IDF and it's just so discouraging

528
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
And so they see a rocket launcher

529
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Which is pretty much a PVC tube

530
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,960
With some welded pieces of metal being shot out

531
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Not saying that this is good

532
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,960
But man, they do take pride in showing how they destroy stuff

533
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Don't they?

534
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
It's a very American thing as well, by the way

535
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
It's just disgusting

536
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Just talking about that takes the wind out of me a little bit

537
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,960
But of course, it's a footballer Monday, so that's kind of part for the course

538
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
So if there's more demonstrations planned

539
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
What I would like you to do is as soon as possible

540
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Put those on the drop

541
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,960
So that I can promote them and let people know what's going on

542
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Drop.io slash daily source code

543
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Please, I'm looking forward to as much help as I can possibly get

544
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,960
And as much help as I can possibly get

545
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
This is the daily source code

546
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
And I'm Gary

547
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
We are all keeping

548
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,960
Absolutely

549
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
I want to see you here

550
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I want to see you here

551
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
I want to see you here

552
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
I want to see you here

553
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I want to see you here

554
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
I want to see you here

555
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
I want you to see me

556
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
I want you to see me

557
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,160
I...

558
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
Fashi so I love to jump just like me

559
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Get a plunger

560
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:49,960
You know, I think I saw you, I watched that, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw

561
00:40:49,960 --> 00:41:19,960
I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I saw you, I

562
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm not that I want to play any kind of music that would invite you to a protest and write it

563
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
or anything.

564
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,640
It's time to testify MC5 on the Charlie 6-1-8-1-6.

565
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Oh.

566
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Nice fade out.

567
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Crap.

568
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Crap drop stuff.

569
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,960
Just looking through the drop and reading some of the articles that are feature that are

570
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,840
been posted there by the charcoal heads.

571
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,720
The photographer arrested in London for so-called terrorist activities.

572
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,600
You can't go around photographing everything.

573
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
God forbid.

574
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Let me click on this order.

575
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I know I read it before.

576
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,960
I might as well take a look at this from Boeing Boeing.

577
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,040
Let's see what the article says because there's so much dumb stuff going on.

578
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,080
I can't believe the Brits are standing for this.

579
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Here it is.

580
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,520
Photographing and painting around this home neighborhood of elephant and castle in

581
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,800
London was arrested under anti-terror laws and jailed.

582
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,320
His DNA in fingerprints taken released after five hours once his member of Parliament

583
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
intervened.

584
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,440
It took some actual intervention there under current policies as DNA will remain on file

585
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
forever of course.

586
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,360
You're getting a donation though the EU was ordered Britain to cease this practice.

587
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Yeah sure.

588
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:39,920
I'd like the UN Resolution to cease fire between Hamas and the IDF please.

589
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Here's a studio near the 19th of December.

590
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,040
Let me see if I can get this here.

591
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,920
The studio near the 1960 shopping center at the heart of this area in South London again

592
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
near where I am.

593
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,160
These are familiar figures regularly seen snapping and sketching the people and buildings

594
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
around this home.

595
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,720
Currently the site of Europe's largest regeneration project but to police officers who

596
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,280
arrested him last week, his photographing of the old HMSO print works close to the local

597
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
police station, posed an unacceptable security risk.

598
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,880
You slave.

599
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,880
The car skidded to a halt like something out of star skiing hutch in this officer

600
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,200
jumped out very dramatically and said what are you doing?

601
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
What are you?

602
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
What are you doing?

603
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,240
I told him I was photographing the building and he said he was going to search

604
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,160
me under the anti-terrorism act and this happens all the time and I want you to delete

605
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
your photos.

606
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
It's crazy.

607
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
It's absolutely nuts.

608
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,400
We should stop this and if that means we got to start the stopping by throwing shoes

609
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
and protesting.

610
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,240
Yeah, that's a good start I'd say again use that drop.au slash daily source code to get

611
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
the word out.

612
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Let's see we got some feedback here, a good friend Ross, what does he have to say?

613
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:59,680
Hey, Curry, Russian Washington, just a little feedback for you here in 2009.

614
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,800
Notice that the first DSC of this week was cut off right as an hour.

615
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah, so actually I think the show was exactly one hour the first DSC of 2009 but this

616
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,600
is going back to people who've just joined the stream but maybe you weren't paying attention

617
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,760
at the beginning of the podcast and you didn't hear it but I'm changing the way I'm going

618
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,400
back to the way I used to bake the MP3s because audio hijack pro for whatever reason

619
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,840
is screwing up all kinds of listening experiences on iTunes and iPhones.

620
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:35,120
I'm surprised that a top shoe did not go into kind of an archive.

621
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:42,280
I know that blog talk does have that but I can't say if talk shoe does might want to look

622
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:49,360
into that otherwise the bike you cut it off for this time right with the second one.

623
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,360
So that worked.

624
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,600
I've also noticed that Noah Jen knows about 40, 43 minutes longer than it cuts.

625
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Nah, I see that.

626
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
This is really way that.

627
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,240
Ah, it makes me so angry.

628
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,880
I don't understand is this not some kind of uniform thing?

629
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,720
Hey, printing time code and again, I was very careful not to select variable bit right but

630
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,600
constant bit right and still didn't work.

631
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,360
Also found that interesting site that seems to be reporting reasonably well.

632
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,520
It's called the first post and it's actually a mainstream publication.

633
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,200
It's owned by Dennis Felix.

634
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,040
This is a guy who owns many media properties in the United Kingdom and you can find it at

635
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
the firstpost.co.uk.

636
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,040
I see people in the chat room were talking about daily mail and different publications,

637
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,160
Guardian, BBC and how bias they may or may not be well, they are biased and they're

638
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,960
biased not because they're biased, they're biased because this is the culture, this

639
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,560
is the DNA of mainstream broadcasting.

640
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,880
I've been in this myself.

641
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,560
I've never made a joke about Madonna when you're on MTV.

642
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,560
It was just not done.

643
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,240
They didn't have to write down the rules, I knew it.

644
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,280
And of course now everything that goes out on the airways in the BBC must be cleared

645
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,960
by at least two people.

646
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,080
So how can you ever get any information out?

647
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,280
How?

648
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,320
And the two pieces of the most disappointing pieces of news that the European Union and certainly

649
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,200
Britain right up front there, starting in 2010, will ban the sale of plasma screens.

650
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,720
So I have to get my new TV's quick, I guess, but more interesting, something we talked

651
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,640
about on no agenda, John C. DeVorek and I is the new light bulbs, the energy-efficient

652
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,360
light bulbs.

653
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,920
Now granted they use a lot less wattage, air-go less energy consumption.

654
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,120
Although I have to say we use dimmers throughout our entire dwelling and that significantly

655
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,360
reduces the draw as well, I mean, we have light bulbs that have been going for 10, 15 years

656
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,440
because we keep them dimmed all the time.

657
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,000
But you won't be able to buy light bulbs anymore, though, with the incandescent light,

658
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,600
it'll have to be these mercury-filled pieces of crap, which of course you're supposed

659
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,120
to recycle great article that I found on the drop as well, that there's a Minister of Parliament

660
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,640
in the United Kingdom who is going to benefit somewhat from this.

661
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,400
We just started, just in time, started a mercury-light bulb energy-efficient savings-piece

662
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,040
of crap recycling system, so he's going to make tons of dough off of that.

663
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,640
It's all a scam.

664
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,040
These guys are all in for the scams and the schemes, and the people who are true and really

665
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,360
trying to change things that just get snowed under, but our time is coming.

666
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:43,360
I want to, before I play this next song, this came in on, let me see if I can find it here.

667
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,240
Ah, excuse me, here we go.

668
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,080
This was from Ernie in Zurich, Switzerland.

669
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,840
He sent us on Friday when I sent out the call for potential Fruber Friday songs, and of

670
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,480
course it didn't get to play it on Friday since we didn't do a Fruber, but wow, this

671
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:05,480
is the kind of song that really makes you feel kind of happy.

672
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:12,040
Just kind of get your feet tapping, and lift and lift up your heart and make sure you're

673
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,640
so open up and feel good inside.

674
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,480
I never told the second place, I know I got what it takes for you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

675
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:35,480
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

676
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
It's never been stolen

677
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,480
One that I needed on to share

678
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,480
That's from me

679
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Love is magic

680
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,480
We need a special place

681
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,480
We need a house based for you

682
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,480
They're not fake us

683
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,480
Two land of brothers, guys

684
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,480
One land that I reside

685
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh

686
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh

687
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

688
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,680
Baby, fuck it

689
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,560
I'm burning in theelijk

690
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,560
I need a power with now

691
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,320
I'll win it

692
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,120
It's nah

693
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,520
Laaו

694
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,980
Yeah me

695
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,360
I'm burning in theetera

696
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,360
Laaו

697
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
No need power

698
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,280
That dishonoured

699
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:38,280
Which will be the best I can steal.

700
00:50:38,280 --> 00:51:05,260
Your emotions are so sad

701
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:26,260
Oh, I feel a belly. He sings so beautifully, don't you agree?

702
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:31,260
Earth wind and fire. The speed of love.

703
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:40,260
What is this? Oh, man. I don't know if they're freaking conference call. Okay. That means I gotta wind it up at about five or ten minutes.

704
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,260
But it's been good kind of an energy release here to do a football Monday.

705
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,260
Let me just, I was looking through that side. I just told you about the first post.co.uk.

706
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:55,260
Here's some of the headlines for today. This is the 12th of January.

707
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:02,260
Israel sends reserveists into Gaza. Israeli armus reserveists were sending to Gaza last night.

708
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:09,260
Is fighting intensified in the strips towns and cities. However, it was unclear if the move signaled the start of the third phase of the conflict.

709
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:15,260
It doesn't sound good. Hey, don't Skype me. Okay. God, that's so annoying.

710
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,260
If you know him, if I don't do one to show, don't Skype me. Use Twitter or use the chat room.

711
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:30,260
Like I just talked about Obama pledges new approach with Iran. President-elect Barack Obama has vowed to act immediately on the US economy in the Middle East crisis in his most wide-ranging television interview.

712
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:38,260
Since election, you have to watch this ABCs this week. A lot of, oh, we have to make tough choices.

713
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:46,260
It means you're going to fuck somebody and I don't think it's just rich people. Oh, no. When it comes to health care, well, we're going to have to make some tough choices.

714
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,260
One of the fuck people, lying cock-sucking son of a bitch.

715
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:58,260
It's okay. He's just following the script. So I can't be angry at him because he's a charismatic guy and he reads the prompter well.

716
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,260
But, oh, man, we're getting so close to no change.

717
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:07,260
Britain's alien car industry could be the next in line to receive a government bailout package.

718
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:13,260
Well, that would be good for me because I've been trying to sell my Jaguar because I don't need it anymore.

719
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,260
I want to buy Jaguars because the company Jaguar Land Rover is so broke.

720
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:23,260
They're asking for a billion pounds to help them. So that would help me. I'd be happy with it.

721
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,260
But I'm also happy and content to just keep it in storage.

722
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:31,260
Keep that hydroxy booster on it because when I need it, it'll be there.

723
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:39,260
Big frack over Prince Harry, some tape surface from, I think, was two or three years ago.

724
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,260
And on this tape, he's talking about his buddies.

725
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,260
You know, the way you talk about your buddies on home video footage.

726
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:52,260
You know, it's South Jersey. We had chat the leaning mule. It was this crippled guy.

727
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,260
He was chat the leaning mule and it was okay. That's what we called him.

728
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,260
You know, it was cool.

729
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,260
People call me, you know, all kinds of names, which are nicknames.

730
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,260
But of course, it's politically incorrect to call someone who's from Pakistan.

731
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,260
Pakistani Paki, although all of the United Kingdom calls him Paki's.

732
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,260
I mean, who are you fucking kidding?

733
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,260
And so another buddy you called Raghead.

734
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,260
So they sold this to, I think, the screws, the news of the world.

735
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,260
And they made a big deal out of it. Poor guy.

736
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:33,260
It's so stupid. And then, of course, dominates the news while children are being killed.

737
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,260
This is also horrible.

738
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Fears are growing for the 249 people still missing after an Indonesian ferry,

739
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,260
sank in heavy seas early on Sunday.

740
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,260
Geez.

741
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,260
Ah, that sucks.

742
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,260
Hey, interesting site. Although it can bummed you out.

743
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,260
It definitely is definitely worth checking out.

744
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:58,260
Alright, little promo from my buddy, Matt Cotto.

745
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,260
With Matt Cotto.

746
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,260
Hi, Adam, it's Matt from Games Weasel on this week's show.

747
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,260
I reviewed low-co-roco 2 on the PSP.

748
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,260
Far Cry 2 on the Xbox 360.

749
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,260
I round up the latest party games for your Wii.

750
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,260
And you can win copies of football manager 2009 for the PC and the PSP.

751
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,260
That's all at gamesweasel.com.

752
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,260
You know, the more things change the more they stay the same.

753
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,260
And you could just go back to songs from the 60s when everyone was pissed off about

754
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,260
Vietnam and Nixon and their crappy ass government.

755
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,260
The history world.

756
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,260
Here it is exploding.

757
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,260
Violence flaring.

758
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,260
Boy, it's loading.

759
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,260
Here old enough to kill.

760
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,260
But not for fun.

761
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,260
You don't believe in war.

762
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,260
But what's that gun you took.

763
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,260
And even the Jordan River.

764
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,260
Has bodies broken.

765
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,260
But yeah.

766
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:54,260
Tell me over and over and over again, my friend.

767
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,260
I you don't believe.

768
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,260
Where I'll be above discretion.

769
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,260
I don't you understand what I'm trying to say.

770
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,260
And can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today.

771
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,260
If the button is pushed.

772
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,260
There's no running away.

773
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,260
There'll be no one to say.

774
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260
With the world in a grey.

775
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,260
Take a look around your boy.

776
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,260
It's found a scarier boy.

777
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,260
And yeah.

778
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:33,260
Tell me over and over and over again, my friend.

779
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,260
I you don't believe.

780
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,260
Where I'll be above discretion.

781
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,260
Think of all the hate.

782
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,260
There isn't red China.

783
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,260
Then take a look around.

784
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,260
To sell my Alabama.

785
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,260
You may leave here.

786
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,260
Before it isn't space.

787
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,260
But when you return.

788
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,260
It's the same old place.

789
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,260
The pound of the drums.

790
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,260
The pride and disgrace.

791
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,260
You can bury it dead.

792
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,260
But don't leave a trace.

793
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,260
H-a-next door, niva.

794
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,260
But don't forget to say gray sand.

795
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:19,260
Tell me over and over and over.

796
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,260
I get in my friend.

797
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
You don't believe.

798
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:28,260
Where I'll be above discretion.

799
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,260
I know no you don't believe.

800
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:37,260
Where I'll be above discretion.

801
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,260
Yeah.

802
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,260
Nice stereo effect.

803
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,260
From the 60s.

804
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,260
To say word to same stuff.

805
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,260
Nothing has changed.

806
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
But why don't I go to the 80s?

807
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,260
You say Africa.

808
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,260
We are the world.

809
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,260
Band-A.

810
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Do they know it's Christmas time?

811
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,260
Nothing changes.

812
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,260
It's futile.

813
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,260
We have to take a different approach.

814
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,260
That's for sure.

815
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:03,260
And that would probably start with taking back government.

816
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,260
Very interesting.

817
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,260
We can't looking at all the new shows coming out of America.

818
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:13,260
Meet the press and George Stephanopolis's show.

819
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,260
Again, President elect Obama on the program.

820
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,260
And it's almost like he's still campaigning.

821
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,260
But look, he keeps saying.

822
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:23,260
But look, there's going to be lots of tough choices.

823
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:28,260
Which means it's not going to be, you know, there's another thing.

824
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,260
This would be the last thing before I shut down dinner is actually waiting for me.

825
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:41,260
I saw Dave Weiner had posted something very interesting on his blog, which I want to read to you.

826
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,260
And which I will respond to.

827
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,260
I don't even think there were even any comments on it on his blog.

828
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,260
No, zero comments.

829
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,260
The blog post is titled, I'm not an economist.

830
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,260
I'll read this to you.

831
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,260
Even though by the way, Dave Weiner, huge Obama supporter.

832
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,260
mega.

833
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,260
Even though I'm not an economist, I'm sure that the US government can print money.

834
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,260
Yes, that's true.

835
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,260
I'll, I'll editorialize here.

836
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,260
Yes, that's true.

837
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:16,260
So if we have a one trillion dollar deficit this year, that does not imply that someone has to lend us one trillion.

838
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:22,260
And does not imply that therefore that someone will have to pay someone back that money at some date in the future.

839
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,260
If there's an economist listening who thinks that it's not true, please say so.

840
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,260
And everyone else ignore what I'm about to say.

841
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:32,260
Well, first of all, the US deficit this year is over eight trillion.

842
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,260
Not one trillion, eight trillion dollars.

843
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,260
This includes all the money the treasury has lent.

844
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,260
Forget the 350 billion of tarp.

845
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,260
That's just a drop in the bucket.

846
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:49,260
And of course, it's really 700 billion, but they spend half.

847
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,260
But in total, buying assets through the treasury with help of Goldman Sachs.

848
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:58,260
That is our treasury secretary's old haunt, old stomping grounds.

849
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,260
As many of those guys look at Larry Summers coming in.

850
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:09,260
It's eight point four trillion dollars, which is about ten times the deficit from last year.

851
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:15,260
In fact, it almost equals the entire deficit of the United States.

852
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,260
So that's incorrect to start off with.

853
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,260
He continues.

854
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:28,260
So now why does the discussion on meet the press in this week revolve around how much better the private sector could spend money or how we're passing on the problem to future generations?

855
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,260
That seems like who he.

856
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:37,260
They have these discussions based on a make-believe premise that there are only two ways for the US government to pay for something.

857
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,260
Taxation or borrowing.

858
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,260
There's a third way.

859
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,260
The one they're taking, they just invent the money.

860
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,260
Well, this is really good.

861
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,260
I'm glad that Dave understands that they are inventing the money.

862
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,260
They're just making it up.

863
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,260
They're not even really printing it.

864
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,260
They're just adding it in it to a spreadsheet.

865
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:59,260
Just add a couple numbers with tons of zeros and you've got the money.

866
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,260
You continue because you know it's coming next.

867
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:06,260
Now in normal times, you pay for this invention with inflation.

868
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,260
Well, yes, you do.

869
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:13,260
You absolutely pay for it by inflation, which is what I call a hidden tax.

870
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,260
And Dave says inflation isn't a problem.

871
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,260
Quite the opposite.

872
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,260
The world economy is having a massive going out of business sale.

873
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,260
You're going down.

874
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,260
Think they're low this week.

875
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,260
Wait until next week, they'll be even lower.

876
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,260
And wait is what people do.

877
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,260
And that drives the prices lower.

878
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,260
I agree with that.

879
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
It's like inflation in reverse.

880
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,260
Wearing about inflation now is like starving a man.

881
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,260
Wearing about getting fat if he eats too much.

882
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,260
You'll take your calories anyway.

883
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,260
You can get him.

884
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,260
But you can't make up calories if you're starving.

885
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:48,260
You can't think yourself extra calories.

886
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,260
Anything that makes people want to buy things now is good for the economy.

887
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,260
One way to do that is to give the money by hiring them.

888
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,260
Oh, yes.

889
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
We're not giving the money to them.

890
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:03,940
We're giving it to large corporations who will take on people at slave wages to build

891
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:11,260
roads, which is probably not what most people went to school for.

892
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,260
So forgive me.

893
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,260
Dave finishes here.

894
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:22,260
Before thinking the analysis on TV, the analysts, sorry, on TV are either corrupt or

895
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,260
idiots or whatever.

896
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,260
And of course, please forgive me if I'm wrong.

897
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,260
And the government isn't going to print money to get out of this whole.

898
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,260
Okay.

899
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,260
Well, first of all, I forgive you.

900
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:37,260
But it's really important because this shows you the thinking of the people who nominated

901
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,260
a voted for Obama.

902
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,260
It doesn't matter if you'd voted for McCain.

903
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,260
It would have been the same result.

904
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:49,260
But the misinformation that is now coming out of this man's mouth, present Alexa mouth,

905
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,260
gives this impression that, oh, no problem.

906
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,260
We can just print the money.

907
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,260
Well, let me explain.

908
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,260
It's dilution.

909
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,260
Okay.

910
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,260
So let's say we have a company with 100 shares.

911
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:04,260
And Dave, you have 10 shares of my company, which you've always wanted.

912
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:08,260
Now let's say I'm just going to make 400 shares.

913
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,260
Are your shares still worth the same amount?

914
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,260
No, it's been diluted.

915
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:17,260
That is exactly what inflation is about.

916
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,260
When you hear inflation, don't think old prices are just rising.

917
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,260
That takes a little while.

918
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,260
And it is stealing from our children's future.

919
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:29,260
And it's to the tune of $8 trillion.

920
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,260
And they're going to have more Senate hearings.

921
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,260
They're going to give away another 350 billion of tarp money.

922
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,260
And it is a complete scam.

923
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,260
Did the 350 billion they gave away before?

924
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,260
Just a piece of the $8 trillion that it helped anyone get any mortgage.

925
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,260
Just now, mortgage is to let six or seven percent.

926
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,260
It is a complete rip off.

927
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,260
What we think we understand where we came from.

928
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,260
What we think we're doing.

929
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,260
The more you begin to see, we've had lied to them.

930
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,260
They lied that lied to them and lied to everybody.

931
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,260
Every year she wants to make sure that the mortgage is in the institution.

932
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,260
That's the only one that's never been told.

933
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,260
I'm thinking now I can lay down.

934
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,260
Put a pack of lots of paper.

935
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,260
We can go told it's all we see.

936
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,260
I don't think you ever want to step inside the chamber.

937
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,260
I don't think you want to see inside the eyes of Vader.

938
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,260
Put a drop right in the force that I bring.

939
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,260
I'm like rock, you want Seattle when you walk in the ring.

940
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,260
I'm stalking the ring.

941
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,260
You couch down the soul when you sing.

942
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,260
But I'm a Zachary.

943
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,260
It's the motherfuckers caught in the bang.

944
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,260
It's all for the thing.

945
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,260
But I'm a woman who was standing tall.

946
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,260
And I ain't stopping like the habit.

947
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,260
And it's really war.

948
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,260
I'm so broke, motherfuckers, you can barely fall.

949
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:33,260
I'm making my family because we can share it all.

950
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,260
Money, the world of all evil.

951
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,260
I don't care at all.

952
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,260
Now we can just respect together.

953
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,260
We get it all.

954
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,260
We've got to do it all.

955
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,260
But like it's not enough.

956
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,260
Don't put a rock the more in.

957
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,260
When they can do it.

958
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,260

962
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,560

963
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:07,460
Like, have a walk around this motherfuckin' with fours, I'm picking up the foot of fucking hole in the floor

964
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,460
I've got to eat something that you wanna explore, unless you want the army comin' kickin' your door

965
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,860
Unless you wanna end up bloody and wet

966
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,860
Fuck China's cover man, what they done to fat

967
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,860
We're fully wet, it's somethin' sad

968
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,360
Where the motherfuckers rob you, where they're gunnin' connect

969
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,760
Where you showed my fuckers, where they come to the fat

Where you toldin' gettin' fix, when you're comin' to sad

Dwecker up cops, where the fuck is gunnin' your vassal

972

Goin' on my feet, y'all I'm goin' on

Where the motherfuckers rob you, where they're gunnin' connect

975
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:00,860
As with just about everything on today's program source from the drop.io slash daily source code

976
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:05,860
Jedi mind-trick's monolith, my history of violence

977
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,060
All I gotta wind it up because I have an eatin' since this morning

978
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:13,260
And Patricia's made me a fantastic suit

979
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,460
I've been keepin' my eye on the chat room, yep

980
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,660
Blood Sugar's low, you're right, I'm gettin' grumpy

981
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,660
I also think the problem is I'm out of weed

982
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,460
Oh, no, no, no, time to panic

983
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,260
Thank y'all for participating everybody on the conference call

984
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,260
Should you wanna say goodbye now as the time, because I've got the phone lines

985
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:34,660
Open thanks for being a part of the chat

986
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,460
No, all right, yeah, who's that?

987
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,060
Hey, Jamaican New York man, haven't heard you in a long time

988
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,460
How you doin' my brother?

989
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:45,260
I've been hiding, you know the economy, but I know everything, you know

990
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,260
So we have to reload some time

991
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,860
I hear you, man, I hear you, you gotta send me some voicemail comment again

992
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,260
Jamaican New York, I missed you

993
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,660
Oh, good, I missed you too

994
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,260
Yeah, man, and send me some tunes to play

995
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:02,260
I'm really into reggae these days, I don't know what it is, but I'm just digging it

996
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,860
For sure, for sure, no problem

997
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,860
No problem

998
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:09,460
All right, everybody, thanks a lot. This was DailySourceCode episode 816

999
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,460
I'll be back later in the week, maybe tomorrow depends on the schedule

1000
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:18,660
But I am ahead, so I'm looking forward to more of the chuckle, Charlie, Chacha

1001
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,660
You still got some freedom, post that shite on the drop

1002
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:27,660
Check the show notes, the DailySourceCode.com, crossposts that are curried.com

1003
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,260
And whatever you do, live your life with passion

1004
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:34,660
Another fine, medial presentation, stick it in your ear
