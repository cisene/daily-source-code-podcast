1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 8-1-9.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is the worst moment of my entire life.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who am I, everybody?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Are you ready for this?

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want my bail out money.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Keep the bills coming.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sweep, grin, crash, just drippin' like honey.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm a new cutter cog with the watching to buzz.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Cause feelin' that bitch better than real drugs.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you think's gonna happen when they double the money supply?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A $4 dollar makes it harder for you to survive.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And take those billions of trains and give it to their old clients.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hope it's all mine.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Feelin' right by it.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We got runaway credit.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ain't nothing going down unless the cooks is marching for less.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I live as great, but it still doesn't get it.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cause the economy is crashous or bad.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It leaves a parallel valley.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want my bail out money.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sweep, grin, crash, just drippin' like honey.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You've got to keep this economy running.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I need another hit.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm a bail out money.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What could you say?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's like a mad dash for the cash.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I got the tax payer taken.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's in the ass.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I see yours.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They are having the blast.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why the work and ball trying to make a paycheck mass?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The bail out money is created with new debts.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But why they're growing in the middle of a strategist.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All the work is on the streets.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sip and sweat.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But my car don't have to lose, I'll take it.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Everything that can wreck.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This was the nation on a hyper-reficion track.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The residential administration can take it back.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And now the tax payers pickin' up the sign.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I like to put a high dollar big brother, monkey on your back.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I want my bail out money.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sweep, grin, crash, just drippin' like honey.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You've got to keep this economy running.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You've got to keep this economy running.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I need another hit.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
bail out money.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sweep, grin, just drippin' like honey.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sweep, grin, crash, just drippin' like honey.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sweep, grin, crash, just drippin' like honey.

Sweep, grin, angry, pues' curtin me.

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sweep, grin,rab, kotin' like honey.

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
But it's in the red.

106
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
It got a mini dance.

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
The politician said that we're going to be

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
all in the red.

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Paying by a friend.

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
The people are being blessed.

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
But get it through your head that we're going to be.

112
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
The bankers got to stay ahead.

113
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,100
Got to make more bread.

114
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,400
That's when they said, bro.

115
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
More money.

116
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Ha ha ha.

117
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah.

118
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Give me some of my bailout money.

119
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Everybody how you doing?

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
It's a silly source code episode number 81.

121
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,200
Niner.

122
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,400
We are rocking into the weekend with a food bar Friday.

123
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Totally loaded up.

124
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,300
We've got the top share chat room filled.

125
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,000
The stream is running and a phone number for you to call within the next hour.

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
You can't even ask ice cream or a kid's a screamer.

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,000
But the cool song real is who you gotta be.

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Love and community laughter is a turn of your choice real.

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
You can't go now.

130
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,400
You can't go now.

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
You can't go now.

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
You can't go.

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
You can't go.

134
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
You can't go.

135
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
You can't go.

136
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
You can't go.

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
You can't go.

138
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
You can't go.

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
You can't go.

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
You can't go.

141
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
You can't go.

142
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
You can't go.

143
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
You can't go.

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
You can't go.

145
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
You can't go.

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
You can't go.

147
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
You can't go.

148
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
You can't go.

149
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
You can't go.

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,720
It's successful so you can't keep taking pictures.

151
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,280
Medic on it more urgently, mostly for such a romantic story.

152
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
And then see you guys soon.

153
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
You can't go.

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,120
You can't even go.

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,800
You can't go.

156
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
You can't go 好 there.

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
It is impossible to find the location.

158
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:23,120
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you

Let me in the soul, let me in the soul, let me in the soul, let me in the soul.

161
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Special thanks to a good buddy Ray for sending me a whole bunch of songs to play on the Charlie for today.

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,120
You too, get on your boots. It should be downloadable from their side, on February 15th.

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
And of course, you legally play right now on Daddy's Source code every one night.

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Screw up, man. If they can steal from us in Washington, it should be able to steal at least one song and share with my friends,

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
especially for me too.

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:35,120
It's Friday. It is January 23rd, 2009 currently 714 pm in the United Kingdom coming to you from the

167
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Curry Terrace in Southwest London. Yeah, I'm kind of getting used to saying that the Curry Terrace, which relates

168
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,120
totally to the address that we're at. I'm not going to help you in finding that.

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
But I've done a lot of studying about this particular area.

170
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
And this house, in fact, some very interesting people have lived here, famous sculptor.

171
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,120
But more importantly, this entire area, which is kind of the Clapham

172
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Battersea and almost a little bit of the bricks in area, very significant historically.

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
And now I know why I'm feeling so incredibly at home here.

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,120
You know, if you're lucky enough, you've moved into a house where you just feel everything's right.

175
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,120
And man, all three of us have this here. And you know, I guess we're old souls, no regardless.

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
So we kind of fit in, particularly with the Victorian style.

177
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,120
I think the Lady Patricia in this life was dates back to the Victorian era.

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
She can't hear me obviously.

179
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,120
A couple of things that are interesting. One, this is the exact area that in 19...

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,120
And I'm sorry, in 1660 to about 1666.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,120
The famous diarist Samuel Peppy lived in this area. If you've never seen this online

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,120
go to Peppy's diary, p-y-s-d-i-a-r-y, Peppy's diary.com.

183
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,120
You can subscribe to a feed in every single day. You'll get what he wrote in 1660 or whatever.

184
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
I think they do multiple entries for each day.

185
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,120
But I've been following his writing, which is very different from the way we speak these days,

186
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
for a couple of years at least. And I've always enjoyed kind of reading what some guy was,

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
you know, essentially one of the first webloggers was writing about 300 years ago.

188
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,120
And it turns out he lived in this very area. In fact, he retired here at the end of his career

189
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
and passed away a happy man. This was also the time.

190
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,120
I've just got to run some history by in 1666 people in London,

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
because we're right on the other side of the Thames.

192
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,120
So sometimes not considered to be London.

193
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Of course, it is a burrow of London, the burrow of Lambeth.

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,120
The black plague, the black death, was rampant in London with thousands of people dying on a daily basis.

195
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
And what people were doing is running away. They actually locked off London

196
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,120
up until the Thames. And you could buy passes on the black market to get out of London.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
And people moved to this very area to be safe.

198
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,120
It's an interesting side note. The government at the time blamed dogs and cats for spreading the black death.

199
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,120
And they killed tens of thousands of pets, dogs and cats,

200
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
which of course only made the problem worse because dogs and cats actually

201
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
stop rodents like rats who were the trooper portrayed or something problem.

202
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
So that only accelerated everything. And then to add on top of all that.

203
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,120
So I'm feeling good. This is a place where people would flee from the city when peril was there.

204
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,120
And you know, I'm feeling some perilous times are ahead of us.

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I love the fact that Peppies lived in this area.

206
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
And so I did, that's a very creative vibe.

207
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:03,120
But I also discovered that in Clapham, one of the two remaining unused, deep level shelters

208
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
is located here.

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
100 feet under the earth.

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
No, not Churchill Eisenhower.

211
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Used one of the, one of the other deep level shelters during the second world war as a communication center.

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
And this thing literally, it can house 8,000 people.

213
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
And they've tried to flog it off to nightclub owners.

214
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,120
And it's always been bounced off because of zoning regulations and health and safety concerns.

215
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
And you know, people want to make a nightclub in it, which would be really cool.

216
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,120
So it's just kind of nice to know that within not exactly walking, but within running distance,

217
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
there's a deep level shelter.

218
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
So when the shit really hits the fan, would it all really really comes down?

219
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I know that, uh, well, kind of be safe.

220
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I got a phone number for you guys to call and see if we can get that work in today.

221
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,120
And of course, the talk tube bridge is over.

222
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,120
With all the shitty sound you're used to over there.

223
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Yeah.

224
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I don't worry.

225
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
One more song from Ray is from Dutch Band.

226
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
And so nice to hear this one again.

227
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,120
You don't hear this stuff made in Holland anymore.

228
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
This is, uh, I think it's early 80s.

229
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Fatal flowers, younger days, on the Charlie 819.

230
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I've been through the time until this guy, I used to know him.

231
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
And he's been telling me all the story.

232
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
By the long time ago,

233
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
makes you want to come back to those places.

234
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
You used to struggle all night.

235
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Makes you realize that these are times long gone by.

236
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:05,120
You're young today that's still with time.

237
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:15,120
You're young today that's still with time.

238
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
You're young today that's still with time.

239
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
You're young today that's still with time.

240
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
You're young today that's still with time.

241
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
You're young today that's still with time.

242
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
You're young today that's still with time.

243
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
You're young today that's still with time.

244
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
You're young today that's still with time.

245
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
You're young today that's still with time.

246
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
You're young today that's still with time.

247
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
You're young today that's still with time.

248
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
You're young today that's still with time.

249
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
You're young today that's still with time.

250
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
You're young today that's still with time.

251
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
You're young today that's still with time.

252
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
You're young today that's still with time.

253
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
You're young today that's still with time.

254
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
You're young today that's still with time.

255
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
You're young today that's still with time.

256
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
You're young today that's still with time.

257
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
You're young today that's still with time.

258
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
You're young today that's still with time.

259
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
You're young today that's still with time.

260
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
You're young today that's still with time.

261
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
You're young today that's still with time.

262
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:26,120
There's no use fighting a whole room to a feeling, feeling change in time

263
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Well time will pass you by

264
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Your young days that sail with a child

265
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Your young days that sail with a child

266
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,120
All your young days that sail with a child

267
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:03,120
All your young days that sail with a child

268
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Ah the days of the good old Dutch bands

269
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Fate of flowers as younger days

270
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
All right, so here's how I want to run it for today

271
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm thinking I'm going very very long

272
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Of course the last show I did I believe was on Monday

273
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
At the last show I did we had a different president

274
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
It was George Bush

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Gotta say I watched of course all of the coverage

276
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
And we were covering it ourselves as well on my view

277
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Which was kind of fun

278
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
To do it in it's almost like I'm looking at what was the John C. to work

279
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
We call that a fractal

280
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,120
It's almost like I'm seeing a fractal of MTV being recreated

281
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
But yet it's not exactly the same

282
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
It's a little bit differently

283
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
But so many similarities and seeing how much better we can do

284
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
And everyone recognizing that annoying that will do better

285
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
And it's exciting

286
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,120
It's cool to see a whole group of people just coming together

287
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
And getting stuff out there

288
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Boy I almost don't know where to begin

289
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Because so much as so much has taken place

290
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm just looking at my story list of stuff that I saved

291
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,120
To talk about most of this of course comes from the drop

292
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
If you've never been there before please

293
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Point your web browser to drop.io slash daily source code

294
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It is a fantastic

295
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Jumble mashup of

296
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Mainly mainstream stories

297
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
That really hit home when you think about what's what's going on in the world

298
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Things you just don't see

299
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Often enough and airgo don't really exist

300
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I finally convinced the lady Patricia

301
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I've really been complaining a lot lately

302
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,120
And you know what man she really must love me

303
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Because every single day you know now that I'm a Londoner

304
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Now that I'm a city boy

305
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,120
I walk out I go pick up a newspaper

306
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I pick up a paper for her

307
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
She usually wants the daily mirror which is a piece of crap

308
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I pick up the financial times

309
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
And then I'll come back

310
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Pick up a capuccino

311
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,120
And the official capuccino with the official Italian place

312
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Not a chain

313
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Right around the corner

314
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Nice little walk back to the curry square

315
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
And then she'll do my hair

316
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Because I'm on a six day week schedule now with the video production

317
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Seven days a week of full-on production

318
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Really if you look at if you take Saturday into account with the no agenda

319
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
So it's kind of nonstop

320
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,120
And she's always done my hair

321
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
As far as long as we've been married

322
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Whenever I have to do something that is

323
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Because if not then it just looks you know

324
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
I just I don't shave or do anything

325
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Now it's a whole new life for me

326
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Shaving my god what a concept

327
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Every day no less

328
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Getting my hair made up done per day every day

329
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,120
I've learned to do my own makeup now by now

330
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
But I'm also doing my own

331
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
My own production, my own writing, my own camera work, my own lighting, my own sound

332
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Engineering, my own editing

333
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
It's been quite an experience

334
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
But I'm in a pretty good vibe

335
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
And just need

336
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Well I've gotten things I've gotten a lot faster

337
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
You have no idea by the way

338
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
I still don't have the virgin 50 megabit

339
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Or even the 20 megabit that they've promised me in yet

340
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,120
But just having BT which I think is five megabits five or eight

341
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Something like that

342
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Oh

343
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Your life goes so much faster

344
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I can multitask

345
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
I mean at this moment I'm actually

346
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
I'm watching

347
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
CNBC on the sling box from my buddy in

348
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
In Chicago

349
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
You're just gonna just turn it on for a second

350
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Unfortunately

351
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Aaron Burnett is not on today

352
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Which is kind of a bummer

353
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I have a bet riding by February 14th

354
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I expect the stock market the Dow Jones to be at 7286

355
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
And it's been all over the place

356
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
If we have two down days

357
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
The way we've seen them right now

358
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
The mark is up a little bit

359
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
If we have two down days

360
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Then I'll make my hundred bucks

361
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Of course that won't be worth much anymore

362
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Although

363
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,120
A hundred bucks in British pounds

364
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
It's starting to get pretty interesting

365
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
It's now at 137

366
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Unbelievable

367
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
The country

368
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
The United Kingdom is on its way

369
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
To bankruptcy

370
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
They're talking about

371
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Turning to the IMF for support

372
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
Can you believe this is actually happening

373
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Well I'll tell you

374
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
I've learned some things

375
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,120
This is fantastic program on the BBC

376
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
It's called Question Time

377
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
It's a live program

378
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
I think it's a live program

379
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
And they have a panel of politician

380
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Sometimes they'll have a

381
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Political comedian on

382
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
And they'll pick a topic

383
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
And of course it's been a lot

384
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
As been about the bailout

385
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
The exact same thing that has been taking place

386
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
The United States is happening here

387
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
And the government here has now said

388
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Oh we're just going to create a bad bank

389
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Which is the same that's happening in the States

390
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
And that means that bad bank will buy up all the assets

391
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Of the banks

392
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
In effect nationalizing the banking business

393
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
But what people get really pissed off about

394
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,120
And rightly so is when you have a bank like Northern Rock

395
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Which if you've been listening to the show for a year

396
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,120
You know that that was effectively nationalized a year ago

397
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
They just gave

398
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
All those fuckers over there bonuses

399
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
By the way

400
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
For the people who work there

401
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I understand you get a bonus

402
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I'm not really angry at you

403
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm angry at the government for allowing that to happen

404
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
I do pay taxes here

405
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Income taxes as well

406
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Not just

407
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Municipality or council tax but actual income taxes

408
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
And they're just giving it away

409
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
They're giving it away to the same people who created the entire problem

410
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Very much like

411
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Well this is the fantastic thing that I've been watching

412
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,120
These confirmation hearings of Timothy Geitner

413
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Who has been in the treasury

414
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Has been an actual part of handing out the first

415
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,120
$350 billion to banks

416
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Which the treasury

417
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Will not tell us where it went

418
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Who received it

419
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
And now they're going to bring this guy in

420
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
And he's going to hand out the next 350 billion

421
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,120
It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life

422
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
And we're just kind of sitting there and let it pass by

423
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Because we don't have

424
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
And this is what I've really come to

425
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Conclude we don't have the type of media system

426
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
They have any knighted kingdom

427
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Where it's pretty much BBC 1 and BBC 2

428
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Channel 4

429
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Yeah sure we got big brother

430
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
And I'm a celebrity get me out of here

431
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
But Channel 4 is effectively bankrupt

432
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
They're going to fold that into

433
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
More of a public broadcaster

434
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,120
And the rest numbers wise really just doesn't matter

435
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
And there isn't just a show where

436
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Normal people get on on a live show

437
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
And say hey screw that you guys are fucking with us

438
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Stop it

439
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
So that gives me more of his own death

440
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Hey let me try something

441
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Since the talk show

442
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Conference bridge thing

443
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I think pretty much

444
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
A failure

445
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
As far as I can tell

446
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
You know and for a number of reasons

447
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Not necessarily talk shoes fault

448
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
One is that has you know the chat is okay

449
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
You know there's there's much better chat clients out there

450
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm kind of using this chat right now

451
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,120
But there's you know there's no direct number to call into

452
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
It's it's not really efficient

453
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
And of course a lot of people will call in

454
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,120
With Skype which you know I just can't

455
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Skype nine times out of ten sounds like shit

456
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Because I'm dialing into talk shoe with Skype

457
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
So the experience you're getting on talk shoe is crappy sound

458
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
I urge you to listen to the stream

459
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Yeah, I know there's a delay

460
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
It's just a little bit

461
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,120
But something I've

462
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
I have not been able to try out

463
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Which I'd like to do now

464
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Is to see how many incoming lines I can receive on Skype

465
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Am I Skype in number now home on a second I've got to set this up

466
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,120
So I say receive calls your online number from anyone

467
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
So that means anyone should be able to call me here's the number

468
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
It's a new jersey number

469
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
It only if you have something to say

470
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Okay, and this is meant to be called with a regular phone or a cell phone

471
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
If you want to start a conversation

472
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,120
If you want to start a topic if you want it we could even do requests

473
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Oh, yeah, it's the all request Charlie everybody

474
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,120
2 0 1 7 9 3 8 3 3 2

475
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,120
So if you're dialing from overseas plus 1 2 0 1 7 9 3 8 3 3 2

476
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,120
And I'm very curious to see if if that actually works

477
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,120
And if I can what happens if I'm talking to one person and another call comes in

478
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I would presume that it will just it will give me the opportunity to accept another line

479
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,120
If it doesn't do that or if it does that will it will allow me to receive a third line

480
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,120
I don't know I'm pretty sure though if I if I take a call

481
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,120
That the people listening on the talk shoe system

482
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,120
We'll be put on hold automatically and won't be able to hear what's going on

483
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
So you know you're best listening to the stream for sure

484
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,120
201 7 9 3 8 3 3 2

485
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I'll give you this song

486
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,120
If you want to call and if you got anything you want to talk about

487
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,120
You know otherwise just get into some news we'll take in a reverse chronological order and man there's a whole shit load of it

488
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
This is hello down

489
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Hi

490
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I lived in the same place now for six or seven years

491
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,120
See drink I smoke what I want

492
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
It doesn't matter to the folks around here

493
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,120
I just live my life when no need to hurry

494
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
No need to worry

495
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Down here in Bimani

496
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,120
So to put it in a way to make a long story short

497
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,120
When to the store of all the bullets and some more

498
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Put it in the harbor and watch me and in a rope my boat

499
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,120
A thousand miles back to Bimani

500
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I wrote my boat back

501
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
You're a little one day what happened

502
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,120
I made a girl from New York City

503
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,120
She was so so pretty

504
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I fell hit all my heels

505
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,120
She said come home with me to hand watch me

506
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
So I left my home

507
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I left my beach in Bimani

508
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,120
So to put it in a way to make a long story short

509
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,120
When to the store of all the bullets and some more

510
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Put it in the harbor and watch me and I wrote my boat

511
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:19,120
A thousand miles back to Bimani

512
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,120
But I've been there and you're sitting

513
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,120
It turned out that she wasn't quite so pretty

514
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,120
But I've been there and you're sitting

515
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,120
She found out I wasn't too rich

516
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,120
But I've been there and you're sitting

517
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,120
It turned out that she wasn't nearly that pretty

518
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,120
But I've been there and you're sitting

519
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,120
It turned out to be such a bitch

520
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Oh

521
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
I went to the store of all the bullets

522
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
More than one canteen

523
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Three cans of two to through the rough rough waters

524
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
The shark heavy harbors

525
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,120
I wrote my boat a thousand miles back to Bimani

526
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,120
From hello Dave

527
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,120
One of the guys the bands that meet the song

528
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
And said if you don't like it

529
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I'll just walk around and say

530
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
If you don't like it

531
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,520
But if you don't like it, I'll send you a dollar.

532
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,240
I'm like, give out my address.

533
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,960
I'd rather play the song.

534
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,080
I like it though.

535
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,960
Give me any sounds like a place I'd like to be.

536
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,520
Where you can smoke anything.

537
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,480
People don't care.

538
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,320
I wrote my feedback, signed it out to you.

539
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,800
Yeah, we'll leave back home.

540
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,200
All right, so as predicted, I got a call in,

541
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,880
which means the people on talk show are screwed.

542
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,080
So they can't hear it.

543
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,280
Really, the place to be is listening to the stream.

544
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,880
But of course, the majority of listeners are listening to this on the podcast.

545
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
I would presume.

546
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,480
201, 7, 9, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, Chris from Philly, of course.

547
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
How are you doing, man?

548
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Do you know it yourself?

549
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
Yeah.

550
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Are you on a regular phone?

551
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm on an iPhone.

552
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
iPhone, Skype, but all sounds crap.

553
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,640
You know, the iPhone, I must say they've never really

554
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,040
sounded good to me.

555
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,440
Particularly when you have to talk slower.

556
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,480
Yeah, that's the way Apple, a cup of tea, no one's going to talk slower.

557
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,440
It works much better on the iPhone.

558
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
What's on your mind, Chris?

559
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,600
It's one of the ways we think about the last present home,

560
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,240
we're going to be closing this one's on a little bit of TV.

561
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
All right.

562
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Are you walking outside, man?

563
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Because it's really windy.

564
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I am outside.

565
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I'm trying to stay still.

566
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
That's okay.

567
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Well, this is interesting.

568
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,560
I'm glad you brought that up because I did save a number of stories

569
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
about it.

570
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,200
So, here's the danger in what has taken place where there were a couple

571
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,880
of executive orders the day before yesterday, which were actual executive orders

572
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,800
to do actual things.

573
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:40,200
The way the press has spun the Guantanamo Bay executive order is exactly the way

574
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
you perceived it.

575
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,360
The president closed Guantanamo Bay, not true.

576
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,240
What, and I've read the executive order, which is it's a lot of legalese, okay?

577
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,720
Which I always find interesting.

578
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,840
You really got to be careful when it comes to little, you know, the fine print.

579
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,640
Because this is not about Guantanamo Bay.

580
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,600
I think we've kind of forgotten what was going on there.

581
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,520
Can you recall Chris, what the actual issue of Gitmo was?

582
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,800
I just got a, probably the torch, I mean, that and the people just kind of sitting there

583
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
without any charges.

584
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,600
It's not actual legal, you know, the abuse court brings evidence, but they just, yeah,

585
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,960
you can bring it to evidence, but they don't want to see it.

586
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Right.

587
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,240
So this is about, so the torture part, that's a separate issue, which I want to talk

588
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
about in a moment.

589
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,560
But, Habius Corpus is, as I believe it's even written, the God given right, that you have

590
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,160
right to a fair trial, and you can't just be locked up forever.

591
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,520
The way the Bush administration got around this is by doing it in a different country

592
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,640
where jurisdiction, you know, is basically military jurisdiction.

593
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,640
So the issue is that there are people in there, and they've already let hundreds go

594
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,040
who were innocent after a year, two years, three years of detention.

595
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,120
So now there's, I believe the reports are 245 people left, and really this executive

596
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,200
reporter from President Obama was about, which is kind of, it's nasty to read it, about

597
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,920
the disposal of these prisoners.

598
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,360
And so the problem here is, and this is why it's kind of crazy, you know, as a part

599
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,400
of the executive order, it says, yeah, within one year, no longer than one year, Gitmo

600
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
has to be closed.

601
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,600
So apparently they're going to need to, you know, a year to figure out what to do with

602
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
245 people.

603
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,840
Now, if you bring them to the United States, then, you know, you have to, you have only

604
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,440
a set amount of time, and you have to, you know, basically charge them with something

605
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,320
or let them go.

606
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,240
And I would presume that the people who are sitting there, oh, man, Chris, that's real

607
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
noisy.

608
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,080
I would presume that the people, that's all right, man, the people who are sitting there

609
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,240
have been sitting long enough to have either been proven innocent or guilty.

610
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,960
And this is, it's a big conversation I was watching, C. Span, this morning, and people

611
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,280
were calling in and saying, hey, look, if these people committed crimes in the United States

612
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,280
against United States citizens, they should be tried here.

613
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
We should not be afraid.

614
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,360
We've been taught by the Bush administration to be so afraid of everything.

615
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,760
And I think it's time that we say, all right, look, if there's something we think you

616
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,800
did, we're going to bring you over here, we're going to put your ass in jail, and

617
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,120
we're going to put you through a proper process and trial.

618
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,960
And already, you know, people saying, well, you know, because, you know, they may be terrorists

619
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,040
and so we'll have to do like an alcohol thing, we'll have to try them on something else.

620
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,960
And or how about, let's have other countries take them.

621
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,400
And it's funny, because I'm literally reading in the news that all of that, the United Kingdom

622
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,840
is very happy to take some of these prisoners, that's not true.

623
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
Not true.

624
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,120
There's everyone over here saying, oh, we don't want terrorists.

625
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:11,640
Bad for our security, look, these people could be innocent, in fact, most likely, most

626
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,160
of them are innocent.

627
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,160
And I believe we should bring that they should be out of their immediate lease.

628
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,040
So I don't understand why this has to take an entire year to figure this out.

629
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,240
And let me get the article here.

630
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,680
I'm going to click on it.

631
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,040
Yeah, I have a co-workers who's from Yemen, and you were always talking about, you know,

632
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
stuff happened in the world.

633
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,680
It says a lot of times, people get convicted of these terror crimes and get extra died

634
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
back to the country.

635
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,960
But then, you know, countries like, oh, well, you did, you know, two years worth of time

636
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
on an 80-year sentence.

637
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,320
Let's go take a vacation.

638
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,480
I went out to worry about it.

639
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,200
And I don't know what exactly he was talking about for the, what kind of, like, convictions,

640
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,720
but it was very interesting that, you know, we had this horrible feeling about these supposed

641
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,160
terrorists in the Western world, like, probably that they could deal.

642
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:11,560
Well, you know, look, if any of these people are convicted and they're, and they're sent

643
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,120
back to their countries, I'm sorry, I would have to say not if they're convicted, but if

644
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,680
they are exonerated and they're let go, and their countries don't want them, that shouldn't

645
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,680
be our problem.

646
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,680
You know, I'm sorry, I'm just sorry, it's not my problem.

647
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,320
That is if they committed a crime in the United States, and they have been exonerated from

648
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
any crime of the United States.

649
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,000
They put it on a plane, drop them off, and not our problem.

650
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm really sorry.

651
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Nothing.

652
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Nothing.

653
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
We can do about it.

654
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,920
Then it's a shit country that they came from.

655
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,920
We have no compassion for these people as an American public.

656
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
That's clear.

657
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,880
We view them all as terrorists, where as far as I know, you're still innocent until proven

658
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
guilty.

659
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,760
Most of these people have been sitting there for years without any trial or process whatsoever.

660
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,200
A human rights group, and of course, these links are in the show notes.

661
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,040
This is from the Washington Post.

662
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm just going to read this for a second, because this comes down to the interrogation

663
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,680
process, which is another big sticking point.

664
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,160
So the question here is asked, did President Obama's executive order today banning

665
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,520
torture leave wiggle room for the possibility of reverting two coercive techniques that

666
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,200
the current executive order outlaws?

667
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Michael Ratner president for the Center of Constitutional Rights says he thinks the answer

668
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
is yes.

669
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,000
And it comes down to wording.

670
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,840
And again, this is all legalese.

671
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,560
We can't just gloss over this shit.

672
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,720
You got to go to Whitehouse.gov, which is pretty big disappointment at the moment.

673
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,080
It's not really as transparent and certainly up to date as I would expect.

674
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,600
And read these things.

675
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,360
So Obama strongly repudiated torture as he signed today's executive order, which mandates

676
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,680
that the Army Field Manual will be strictly adhered to during interrogations.

677
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,400
You should read that, by the way.

678
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,720
But Ratner point to the following lines in the executive order that he says provides

679
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,680
a possible loophole by creating a task force to study the issue.

680
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,000
And I have to agree, this whole thing is filled with task force.

681
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,600
I do not like task force.

682
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,840
I don't like them in business.

683
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
I don't like them in government.

684
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,680
Whenever someone in my company says, we're going to start a task force.

685
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,720
I'm like, no, you're not.

686
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,120
Because task force are shit.

687
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,880
They net, that's like a steering committee.

688
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,880
That's another one.

689
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,520
I love steering committees because everyone's grabbing the wheel and you usually crash.

690
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,880
So the mission of the task force, the special task force, according to the executive

691
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,760
order shall be one, to study and evaluate whether the interrogation practices and techniques

692
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,520
in Army Field Manual to dash 22.31 employed by departments or agencies outside.

693
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,200
The military provided an appropriate means of acquiring the intelligence necessary to

694
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,600
protect the nation.

695
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,960
And if warranted to recommend any additional or different guidance for other departments

696
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
or agencies.

697
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,600
So the key ratiner says is that the executive order appears to follow for an evaluation

698
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,680
as to whether a keyword here, whether the Army Field Manual techniques are sufficient to

699
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
protect the nation.

700
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,200
He says that allows the task force to find after studying the issue that there may

701
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,080
be cases where it's acceptable to go beyond the Army Field Manual.

702
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,280
And quite honestly, I agree.

703
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,080
I really think that this has been constructed by lawyers and it's put together very,

704
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
very carefully.

705
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,840
And we're all still in such a state of euphoria that we're willing to overlook some

706
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,400
things that just may be hidden in their Chris your thoughts.

707
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:31,920
Jeez, I don't know if you've got the field manual, but did you see the boiling

708
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,760
one close to about the guy who's detained, I think it's a kid actually for owning a

709
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
capsule watch.

710
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,000
Now, if you can take a part and it can be a timer for a bomb.

711
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,880
So that's like the evidence they have to hold him for years.

712
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Right.

713
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Well, so we've got this watch.

714
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,720
So it, right.

715
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,840
So that's the part that I don't think has been repealed.

716
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,920
I believe that somewhere there's an executive order that says if you are an

717
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
enemy combatant or you are deemed to be an enemy combatant, that you can be

718
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,840
and be held basically under military laws.

719
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,120
And I have not seen that repealed anywhere.

720
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,960
So everyone's rejoicing.

721
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,120
Oh, yeah, Obama's going to close Gitmo, but he hasn't closed Gitmo.

722
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,400
It's a whole bunch of legalese that still remains to be seen what's going to

723
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
come out of it.

724
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,280
And I'm just not that convinced yet.

725
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,480
I would be all for it.

726
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,200
I'd like to see these people have fair and due process under American law

727
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,440
if they're being accused of anything otherwise, let them go, drop open the gate.

728
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,200
I just let them go, and unless they were flown there by the United States, let

729
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
them go.

730
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,520
That would be my advice.

731
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,000
Do you know if it affects the black sites or sites that we don't know exist?

732
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,160
Well, it's supposed to, but we'll see.

733
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,680
Hey, I still want to go so, of course, you know.

734
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,480
They don't exist, we don't, you don't have an official knowledge of these places.

736
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,000
So, dude, you sure, you sure you don't really much control.

737
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You sure you don't work in government, because you sound just like a spookman.

738
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,160
That's the way they talk.

739
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,400
We don't know if they exist.

740
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
All right, man.

741
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Thanks for coming.

742
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
What's that?

743
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I want to move.

744
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Yeah.

745
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Here you go.

746
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Thanks for calling in, man.

747
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
And have a great weekend.

748
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Thank you.

749
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
All right, buddy.

750
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Take care.

751
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
All right.

752
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,960
Kind of work so far.

753
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,560
No one else called in during that time.

754
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,760
So I presume that it either doesn't work receiving another call.

755
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,440
Maybe you meant a voice mail or something else.

756
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
I don't know.

757
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,080
201 7 9 3 8 3 3 2.

758
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,640
We're just going to try that a couple more times.

759
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,240
And I'll give you, as I said, some news in reverse chronological order.

760
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,760
It's really, really food bar here.

761
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,560
But for those of you listening and living in the United Kingdom,

762
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,360
Britain is on high alert for Mumbai style terrorist attacks on a top hotel.

763
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,720
Is according to home secretary, Jackie Smith.

764
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
She revealed this yesterday.

765
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,480
She told Ministers of Parliament that security chiefs have been training staff at

766
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,920
major hotels on how to cope with the terror hit terror hit.

767
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,440
Ministers police security services are urgently reviewing the UK's counterterrorism

768
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,720
plans, bloody, bloody, bloody law.

769
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,240
So I don't know why this is their all of a sudden.

770
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,040
I do not like this woman, Jackie Smith.

771
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,040
She seems pretty evil to me.

772
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,800
So if I don't know that it's not fun to think about tomorrow,

773
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,080
by the way, is going to be a huge demonstration in London.

774
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,600
I think actually three are going to be taking place from a associated press just because

775
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,000
I want the honeymoon to end quickly so we can get on and not think, oh, yes, we can.

776
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yes, we did.

777
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Oh, let's all kick back relax.

778
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Obama's in.

779
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
We're all saved.

780
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Everybody.

781
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,040
News organized organizations that cover the White House.

782
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,200
This is from a sociator press,

783
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,080
spared with the Obama administration on Thursday over access issues for photographers and

784
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,600
rules for briefings.

785
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,520
Representatives from the Obama press office held a conference call with photo editors who

786
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,560
were concerned the administration prefers distributing photos taken by a White House

787
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,000
photographer in cases where photo journalists have been permitted access in the past.

788
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,480
So this is kind of interesting.

789
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,760
It seems like they really do want to keep a handle and keep all of the communications

790
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,080
very, very tight.

791
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,240
You know, a picture does speak a thousand words, but it goes on.

792
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,800
It's not just about the pictures, but the associated press also questioned why reporters

793
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:26,120
were not allowed to use the names of administration officials giving a background briefing

794
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,120
on issues regarding Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba.

795
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,080
Information is a lot more valuable to the public if you know where it's coming from.

796
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,560
The AP said so we try very hard in all source situation to identify sources as full

797
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,080
as we can.

798
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,320
Robert Gibbs, who's the new press secretary, did not directly address the issue and asked

799
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,840
about it, saying, I hope you all found the exercise that we did this morning helpful.

800
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,120
So it just sounds like more of the same bull shit and more control.

801
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,200
And I do not see the openness that we've been promised.

802
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,680
I'm sorry, I'm just not seeing it.

803
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,480
201-739-793, I'm sorry, 8332, if you're calling from outside the United States,

804
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,120
plus 1-201-793-8332.

805
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:56,320
See, your eyes, they turn me, why should I stay here?

806
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:16,000
Why should I stay?

807
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:44,320
I'd be crazy not to follow, follow where you lead, your eyes, they turn me,

808
00:43:44,320 --> 00:44:11,280
turn me into phantoms, I follow to the edge of the earth and fall off.

809
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:41,240
If they get the chance and death is my chance, I'd get it by the way.

810
00:44:41,240 --> 00:45:11,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I

811
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:41,240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

812
00:45:41,240 --> 00:46:02,440
You're probably saying yourself, hey man, I knew that song from somewhere.

813
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
What is that song?

814
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,360
You probably know it from, was it radiohead, I think, weird fishes.

815
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,920
David Kloid, who is now on the Podsafe Music Network.

816
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,880
This is an authorized cover, I might want to add, so you can find that at music.potcho.com

817
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,880
and of course, in the show now it's a daily source code.com, crossposted at curry.com.

818
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,280
Something goes right along, you know, and by the way, during the entire inauguration I was

819
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,080
watching a multiple, really the only way to watch it was on television to be quite honest.

820
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,720
We spent, you know, I have a sling box, a very nice guy, and Chicago has given me access

821
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,200
to his sling box, so I was really able to watch uninterrupted.

822
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,640
Everything, every other channel, including the BBC, CNBC, everyone was talking through shit,

823
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,280
you know, just couldn't, except for, you know, the actual oath, which of course, everyone

824
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
messed that one up.

825
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:01,120
By the way, the quartet who was playing with Yitzek Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma, that was,

826
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,680
that was, well, not lip sync, because they didn't sing, but it was recorded two days

827
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,920
earlier, because they were afraid that the weather would warp the instruments, which is

828
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,400
absolutely a valid fear, but kind of goes along with, oh, nice big show you've put on there,

829
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,120
and, wow, the Rita Franklin is pissed off, I've heard her an interview, she's like, the sound

830
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:26,160
was crap, it was, which it was, I don't think she could hear herself at all, even, you know,

831
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,920
for Rita Franklin to be off a little bit on timing, that was unbelievable.

832
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,200
That's just a side note, doesn't make any real big difference.

833
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,000
I did want to mention something that I put on curry.com and embedded video of a movie called

834
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,320
the Wave, which if you haven't looked at it yet, please go to curry.com and it's from earlier

835
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,120
in this week, a couple posts down, you'll see an embedded Google video movie called The Wave,

836
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,920
which was an experiment, and I remember my mom telling me about this, when I was very young,

837
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,040
we'd living in the state, she said, oh, you know, they did this experiment in California,

838
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,480
it turns out it was Paula Walter, where a teacher basically implemented the very simplistic rules

839
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,760
of starting a fascist movement. And please, when you hear the word fascist, don't immediately

840
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,440
think Hitler, yes, it comes down to that, but think about government and a big business colluding

841
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,560
to enslave the people and make them do what they say. That's the way you should view it.

842
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,640
And this was a real experiment, a wrote a book about it, which is true, it's like an

843
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,760
after school movie, really poor acting, poor production, and, you know, it fits neatly within

844
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,200
46 minutes without commercials. But you should take a look at that, because it'll be a real

845
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,320
eye opener, particularly when you think that this is a true story, it actually did happen this way.

846
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,480
The experiment went along these lines, and you can also purchase the book to read about it.

847
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,000
If you want to know how fascism occurs, I think we're dangerously close, certainly in the United

848
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,400
States. In Britain, actually, I'd have to say, as I was trying to get out earlier, I'm pleasantly

849
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,760
surprised to see that the people of Britain have gone through this exercise the United States is going

850
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,760
through, because 12 years ago, Tony Blair was brought in as the young hero, he was going to make

851
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,800
a beautiful world, going to have prosperity, he was going to be fantastic, and this is the new

852
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:26,800
labor, and we wake up 12 years later, and not only is the country, I totally out of control,

853
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,920
but it is a police state, cameras everywhere, people incentivize to spy on their neighbors,

854
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,440
children incentivize to spy on their parents, just it's a complete police state,

855
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,520
luckily, because of the lack of trash, crap, hypnotizing media, people are still relatively

856
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,440
awake here, but now they're just frightened, and there's so many laws that have been introduced,

857
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:00,400
a lot of them terrorism laws, by the way, they barely can protest. You cannot lawfully protest

858
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,000
without a permit in the United Kingdom, which is so cool that these protests are happening,

859
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,160
got big things taking place tomorrow. Bob's calling in from Michigan, Bob.

860
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:16,240
Hey, Adam, hi. Good, man, what's up? Are you formally Dutch or of Dutch descent, Bob De Young,

861
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,400
sounds pretty Dutch to me? Yeah, yeah, you know, that's how I started listening to your podcast

862
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,040
like three years ago, I got, you know, your link from another one I was listening to is this guy,

863
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,880
I never knew you from MTV, and since then I've learned your history in the world. So I tell you

864
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,840
something Bob, there's very few people who know me from MTV anymore, too. Turns out that was a long

865
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:41,120
time ago. So I was in an MTV type back in that day or whatever, but yeah, yeah, yeah, I live in

866
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:46,400
Holland, Michigan, actually I grew up in Wheeling, Michigan, a little Dutch area in sort of Southwest

867
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,440
or Michigan there, not a Dutch name towns. Yep, for sure. Anyway, yeah, anyway, yeah, that's that's my

868
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,760
descent to generations from the Netherlands. So yeah, I was calling in here, and you know, I've been

869
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:06,400
kind of following that the DSC, wow, you know, for three years now, I've been on this sort of

870
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:14,720
particular bent, right? Yeah, I'll tell you, I'll tell you a funny story. Patricia said to me the other

871
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,080
day, you know, do you remember when you were, when we just met she says, you remember when you were so

872
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,920
well, gullible as the real word, you didn't say that, you really trusted people and you thought

873
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,600
people are good, and I said, yeah, yeah, she said, you know, you really changed, and I said,

874
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,200
do you still want to be married to me? She said, yeah, you're irritating, but yeah, oh, that's the thing

875
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,400
but yeah, of course, I mean, I've changed, so the show changes, I've gotten older, I'm watching

876
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,000
my daughter who was 18, and the only thing I have left to really wish for in life is for her to have

877
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:56,080
a good life, you know, and I'd like to, I'd like to try and contribute to, well, certainly making her

878
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,920
aware, which and she's pretty glued in, but if I can change anything and make it better, so she doesn't

879
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,680
have to be a slave, you know, a paid slave of the police state, then yeah, so that's why I've changed,

880
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,520
so I hope, well, thank you for sticking with it, obviously. No, I mean, there was no sticking with it,

881
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,120
it's all interesting stuff, you know, particularly, and I, before I, you know, get off on a

882
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,600
tangent, I just want to give you props for that, you know, because a lot of, you know, there's

883
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,720
a number of guys that you can probably make a pretty good list of folks that are in your position

884
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,760
monetarily wise that, you know, you can just check out and say, hey, you know, cool, I'm done,

885
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,960
but, you know, to give back or pay back whatever you want to call it, and it's a part of

886
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,400
that. You know what it also is? It's, well, thank you, you know what it also is? I have nothing left to

887
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,360
lose, you know, they can take away my money, they can, you know, they can take away, what, what are

888
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,200
they going to do that? There's no way to hurt me other than killing me, which I'm sure one day,

889
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,960
if I go far enough, if you ever read in the paper, suicide, Adam Curry suicide by cop, you know,

890
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,640
don't believe it, and if my airplane comes crashing out of the sky, this thing is the best

891
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,840
maintained aircraft in Western Europe, then it was sabotage. The only thing I ask is that you

892
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,440
make sure you get a hold of my body and smoke me. That's all, just pick me in a pipe and smoke me.

893
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,040
All right, Bob, you got, I'm sure you got something on your mind. Yeah, um, you know, I'm still in

894
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,520
a place where you, uh, kind of said you were, uh, some time ago being a little bit, yeah, you've

895
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,680
called it naive or trusting. Here's something I want to lay on, you know, without the monetary

896
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,040
things that are going on, then I'm talking particularly from the U.S. perspective here, right,

897
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:44,160
with all the deficits spending way beyond what right and ever did. And, um, what, you know,

898
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,720
the bailout situation, especially, and then put another piling on, so to speak, who knows how much

899
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,920
more. What if, you know, nobody knows where all this money is going, and, you know, the rules are in

900
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,320
there and everything else, so that they don't have to tell, which pisses everybody off,

901
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:06,240
and right, rightfully so. But, you know, I used to work for the defense contractor and got

902
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:12,560
in touch and had to work with military people and people in that particular area, and I got to

903
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:18,160
know that there are a lot of smart people working for the government. There are a lot of smart people,

904
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,760
and that they're not always good, but they're not necessarily always evil either. So what about

905
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:30,960
this? You know, what if this, say $800 billion, or just say a trillion dollars just for around

906
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,720
number, that is around number, a trillion dollars, and goes to the banks and what are the paths

907
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,840
it, you know, I guess it follows. They don't have to tell where it goes or whether what they're

908
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,080
going to spend on or who gets it. What if they just don't spend it? Because, you know, you've

909
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:54,480
talked about yourself, you have currency, the value of fiat currency depends on public perception.

910
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:02,160
And money, in the end, whether it's want from a gold or oil or drugs, you know, is a medium of

911
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,960
exchange, you know, you make podcasts back in the day you did video, you know, music videos,

912
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,480
and I make stuff, I'm an engineer, I design things. Somehow we have to change this value to

913
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:23,840
society, that we all contribute, right? And that's money. And maintaining a stable value of that

914
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:29,440
medium of exchange is what this whole system is all about. And sure, some people have taken

915
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:37,520
advantage over, right? But what if this trillion dollars now is not spent, it's not spent. It's just

916
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:45,840
put there. And the news covers it. And it's meant to prop up people's perception of the value

917
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,920
and say, okay, they're going to bail us out. And the natural cycle or the natural work ethic

918
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,800
of people in various industries will get the economies that going back again without any input from

919
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,760
this trillion dollars. I mean, I mean, just, I, it's something the way you're really quickly,

920
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,000
but just think about it. All right, but, okay, a couple things here, because you laid a lot on me.

921
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,280
First of all, people in government. So I agree, and I'm not just talking about people who sit in

922
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,520
in governmental buildings. I'm talking about civil servants. Please pay close attention to what they're

923
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:30,480
called civil servants. They serve for us. They are not your masters, the police, other institutions

924
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,840
like that. It's really compartmentalization. By the way, my whole family is government. It was just

925
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:41,520
probably one of the main reasons I'm doing all of this. My uncle, in particular, very high-placed

926
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,600
official within the Bush administration, the first Bush administration. By the way, he hates

927
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:54,160
with a passion, hates George W Bush, but that's another story. But it really is what you know

928
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,080
want to need to know basis. And there's really a lack of knowledge. But even in government, these

929
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:06,400
are just normal people. A lot of senators and representatives who have great intentions, they're

930
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,400
not necessarily, if look Carolyn Kennedy was up for a Senate seat. You know, she's just a normal

931
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,520
person. Yeah, she comes from a somewhat abnormal family and probably with a lot of good intentions.

932
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:26,240
And it's just as susceptible to being snowed in or confused or lied to or just not being

933
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,240
able to understand the situation. Even people on the Senate finance committee, according to

934
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,520
representative Dr. Ron Paul, he said that the other day someone asked him and said,

935
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,280
well, the dollar is still backed by gold, isn't it? They just don't know. So of course, you can't

936
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,560
blame them. You can't really blame anyone in government because it truly is the owners of the earth.

937
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,840
And I'm looking at you, Briginski out there. These are the people who are really pulling the strings.

938
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:05,600
And they do it in very sophisticated ways, extremely sophisticated ways. So people in government are

939
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,280
not necessarily bad. But you know, they do get steered into, and again, go watch the movie,

940
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,760
the wave. It shows exactly how this happens and how it's possible. And I see a lot of this danger

941
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,120
with the Obama euphoria. Now, when it comes to what you're first of all, I believe that we're

942
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,560
probably about $8 trillion in the whole right now. And that has been confirmed by multiple sources.

943
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:35,600
Bloomberg is the one I would really trust on that. Even if you didn't spend it, it has been created.

944
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,400
So it's on the balance sheet. And it's not like this was actually printed or anything like that.

945
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,120
So it doesn't really matter if it's given out or not. But the fact remains, and this is

946
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,720
something that everyone does admit to, it's been given to banks. And these banks have all turned around

947
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:57,840
and have given themselves huge bonuses. I'm sure you heard about the CEO of Merrill Lynch who was just

948
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:04,080
kicked out now that the, you know, this whole big acquisition by Bank of America. I don't even know

949
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:11,920
if this made mainstream, it was all over CNBC yesterday that after, after that, his bank received,

950
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:19,040
I believe, $6 billion in financial support from the government. He redecorated his office, which

951
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:26,640
included a $32,000 toilet, you know, an $80,000 desk. I mean, it's not kidding. He even gave

952
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,840
eight grand just as a tip to the designer. You know, it's, it's crazy. It's, and it's, it hurts. So,

953
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,640
you know, if these banks are really in such dire straits, and if it really was true, and I'll get

954
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,840
to that in a second, that we needed to bail these banks out to save the world, as Gordon Brown said,

955
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:49,920
because that's the way he feels it. He feels he's saving the world. Then there's no reason for them

956
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,560
to be giving themselves bonuses. They should be hurt and just as bad as everybody else because

957
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:02,160
everyone else is paying for it. Now, so, so basically, it's a dilution of the money supply, and

958
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:10,560
and it is just as immoral immoral as deluding the milk supply. So, let's say we have milk, and we

959
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,240
got a big supply of milk, and the government says, you know what, we need to give some more milk

960
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,320
to this group of people over here, but we don't have enough milk, so we're going to put water in the

961
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,040
milk. That's, it's immoral, because then it's not milk anymore, it's watered down the crap.

962
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,240
So, they're watering down, they're diluting the money supply, and it's really immoral. The whole

963
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,520
system is, is, is the problem. So, in that regard, yes, we, you know, this system is broken,

964
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,720
it will not come back, it's bust, and all I can see right now is everyone just running for it,

965
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,400
saying, hey man, just keep me some fucking dough, dude. I'll hook you up later. I got the place

966
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:50,320
set in Paraguay. We'll be safe. So, what if we just let it run its course? I love that question, Bob,

967
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:57,920
because I believe that capitalism without bankruptcy is the same as religion without hell.

968
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:06,000
You cannot have capitalism without the fear of bankruptcy. If you can't go bankrupt, which is what

969
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,880
all, and I'm an entrepreneur, I've been an entrepreneur almost all my life, I've worked for a

970
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,840
couple of bosses, but I've really had my own companies or I've been my own boss, and that's

971
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,760
the overhang fear. If you don't kick ass and keep running and follow the money and chase and do

972
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,400
good work and do stuff, and then you'll go belly up and you'll be screwed. So, you have to have

973
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,880
that hanging over a capitalist system. Let me ask you a question, Bob, because this is something

974
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,280
I've actually been meaning to ask a lot of people. Do you know what form of government we live

975
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:45,520
in the United States? That's a federation. No. Not necessarily democracy, but it's a republic.

976
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:52,960
Right, exactly. I'm happy you said that, because I have heard time and time again, and I read time

977
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:59,440
and time again, people saying, we live in a democracy. You do not live in a democracy. The United

978
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:06,960
States is a republic, which means the rule of law. The law is what makes the difference. Not the

979
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,960
majority, but the law, the laws are agreed to, and we abide by the laws, and if you break the law,

980
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,280
you have to be convicted by 100% of a jury of your peers, and that's the way it goes. But it feels

981
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:25,200
to me like more and more people are starting to believe that it's a democracy and this

982
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,480
transparent and we're open and we'll all agree on stuff and the majority rules. So I'm

983
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,040
happy to hear you recognize that it's a republic, because I believe people are forgetting that.

984
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:43,200
Yeah, well, in a country this size too, I mean, it really, I mean, on the other hand, with

985
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:50,400
technology the way it is, having a true democracy is becoming more and more technically feasible.

986
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,760
I mean, that's what we elect representatives for. That's the way it was set up. It's a reason

987
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,800
it was set up the way it was way back one, right over two hundred years ago. Genius, genius,

988
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,200
genius, genius from our family fathers, it is the only, it is really the only former, I believe,

989
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,520
the only form of government that in the long run actually works. Well, actually, you know,

990
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,320
one of the best, one of the most fun facts I have on the iPhone years, the Constitution. It's a free

991
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,800
app and you can put it on there and read it in its elegant simplicity as you said in your show a

992
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:24,800
number of times. Yep. And it's just beautifully simple ways of reading out absolutely clearly.

993
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,200
Bob, I really appreciate you calling it in, because there were a couple of things I wanted to get

994
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,320
out this show and you really helped me along. So that is just perfect. I'm going to play this

995
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:40,560
next song for you, Bob. I think you'll appreciate it. I pledge to the flag of the United

996
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:51,280
Snakes of captivity and to the Republic for which it stands, I dip it in carousine and stick it

997
01:03:51,280 --> 01:04:08,000
up the ass of you know who and light it. One nation under God or else. One nation under psychopathic

998
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:16,720
Pentagon gangsters whose idea of national security is concentration camps for people who dare to use the

999
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:29,520
drugs that the CIA brings in and the government supplies themselves. One nation under Wall Street,

1000
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:38,960
if the cops in the government are all crooks, I might as well be one too. One nation of

1001
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:50,960
sedated tabloid robots who actually believe what they see on TV, even on MTV and when asked what they

1002
01:04:51,040 --> 01:05:00,880
think about it, they reply, oh dear. One nation drowning in its own garbage,

1003
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:09,520
indivisible from the fall of Rome with liberty and justice for all who can afford it.

1004
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:25,760
Burn baby burn. Burn baby burn. Old glory. The Yankee Swastika. Burn baby burn. Burn baby burn.

1005
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:34,160
Whenever I see you I see red. Whenever I see you I see red. If the communist countries can do it,

1006
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:47,760
why can't we throw the bastards out and try some real democracy? Run not by rich people,

1007
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:55,920
not by military people, not by sons of senator sons of senator sons of senator sons,

1008
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:02,480
have you noticed how the more they give people back their freedom over there? The more they take

1009
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:10,560
it away over here. So now, before it's too late to even talk about stuff like this,

1010
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,880
be a patriot, a good patriot. The one that cares about their country more than forcing people to

1011
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:26,160
worship a flag and take the Swastika. The Yankee Swastika and let it burn, burn, baby burn.

1012
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:34,480
Hell be Afra. I don't give it everything he says, but man he does hit home on a lot of those things.

1045
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:43,200
your eocrespondent she is b yeah so u s a has now 44th president and for the first

1046
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:51,640
time it is not white guy obama but at least the first two oh sorry about that and

1047
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:58,360
didn't mean to start an over again she is b so u s a has now 44th president and for

1048
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:06,280
the first time it is not white guy obama at least as far as we know but what obama president

1049
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:12,120
it means to european union well he's well let me tell you something before you even

1050
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:20,280
start c s b Gordon Brown keeps talking about obama and I guess swear the guy is having

1051
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:25,160
a mini orgasm when he does it he just keeps talking obama and obama is coming over here

1052
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:31,800
obama this he really is trying to take some of that obama shine and rubbing on himself

1053
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,480
and boy he needs it we had the g twenty coming up in a couple of weeks and obama will be here

1054
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:42,600
as well as a part of the g twenty and god it's like oh it's just I mean you know if you could

1055
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:49,000
be sucking his dick he'd be doing it is of mixed european origins english irish dot

1056
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:59,240
french and german so obama himself partially fifty percent is european anyway and purely african

1057
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,080
on this father side which of course is still a huge dispute where there was born in america

1058
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:08,680
not i don't really care either way i mean according as a constitutionalist i should but we're never

1059
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:13,000
going to find out the answer anyway and apparently the supreme court doesn't give a shit so

1060
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:19,160
was have to leave it at that i'd like to underline it is not europe that must rise to the challenge

1061
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:26,280
of being a partner of obama but it is obama that must understand that european union does

1062
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:36,200
not meet any more american divide and rule you know he make a good point there and let me

1063
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,760
say the following first of all obama speech was written by a twenty seven year old kid in the star

1064
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:46,040
box and i'm not joking about that his speed you know these that all have speech writers and

1065
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:52,280
what i had a couple of things i really didn't like about his about his speech the first one was

1066
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:58,840
the situation we're in right now it's all our fault and i felt i was really offended by that

1067
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:05,240
because i've done nothing but try and make the economy work i provide jobs for a fifty sixty

1068
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:12,360
seventy people pay corporation taxes pay income taxes really try to be a part of the system

1069
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:19,240
and the the bank take take down i should say it's not my fault it's not it's not american

1070
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:24,440
citizen's fault it's it's a bunch of greedy cox occurs who are just stealing the money now

1071
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:31,320
while they can because you are right in this regard america needs europe and they all will get

1072
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:37,560
together because that is actually the point they want to have one bank so now we were aggregating

1073
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:43,160
these banks i think even called aggregator banks bad banks i love to have that on my door hi

1074
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,160
welcome to the bad bank so we've got the bad bank in america that will have all the toxic

1075
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,040
access and will have all this crap that'll be on uh... the country's books forever and they're

1076
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,200
doing the same in europe and the reason is as much easier than to create one huge bad bank the

1077
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,600
bad bank of the world and that bad bank of the world will create the bad government of the world

1078
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:06,200
so um... yes obama totally needs that another thing uh... excuse me in the speech that

1079
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:14,360
that in like is we are ready to lead once again that to me uh... could be deemed as offensive

1080
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:19,000
to other countries who the fuck died in may you king mother fucker that's kind of what i'd be

1081
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,440
saying if i truly was a european so i do agree with you on that csp strategy directed at

1082
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:33,000
splitting european union destroying our unity so barak h obama and the whole u.s.a

1083
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:41,880
please unclench your feast towards you and i'm carry happy obama to you you happy obama to you

1084
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,320
uh... it's too bad and gb left uh... the chair i really wish you would call in because i was she was

1085
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:53,640
twittering a lot of stuff uh... during the inauguration and i fact i saw a lot of people tweet

1086
01:14:53,720 --> 01:15:00,280
the same thing like goodbye bush nanana hey hey hey hey goodbye and you know what i'm like

1087
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:06,440
you are so clueless as to what's going on it's also in my mind that's kind of an unamerican

1088
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,640
thing to do there's nothing like uh... nothing worse than uh... a sore winner you know when

1089
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:17,400
your guy wins or however you want to perceive it to be going nanny nanny nanny nanny if you haven't

1090
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:23,080
seen the picture of ramen manuel uh... arguably the most powerful guy in the white house uh next to

1091
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,480
what maybe even more powerful than obama uh... you should see it uh... devouric at a picture

1092
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:33,560
he's literally doing a thumb and finger thing to someone in the crowd going nanny nanny

1093
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,760
who knows what it was for but it just kind of shows you and i'm against that you know where

1094
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:44,680
was everybody with the with the big fuck you when bush was committing all these atrocities

1095
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:50,920
and where will you be as you watch you know now the uh... all kinds of confirmations are being

1096
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:55,080
delayed because of well you know we don't really want this guy to be uh... in charge

1097
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,760
like attorney general or anything hold her i think his name is

1098
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,680
we don't want hold her in because you know he might prosecutes and people well yeah that's

1099
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,640
what we should be doing but no everyone's making jokes and also happy to see that helicopter

1100
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:13,560
go and meanwhile you're getting a big hot flaming poker up the rectum right in front of your

1101
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:20,200

1111

01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,980
It'll get off my knees in vain

1129
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,360
And we don't, it's full again

1130
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,540
No no

1131
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:56,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1132
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:26,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1133
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:56,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1134

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1135
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:30,540
It's now hot in all the right

1136
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:35,540
It can appear to fall on the roll of the night

1137
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:42,540
I'll get my head to the new constitution

1138
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,540
Think about all of you, never knew

1139
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,540
If I breathe, you don't allow

1140
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,540
Feel like it's all I've been

01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,540

1208
01:24:33,540 --> 01:25:02,260
Meet the new boss, same as the old boss, the who won't be fooled again.

1209
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:09,700
Awesome to be looking at the chat room, seeing so many people who had never heard that song before.

1210
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,700
You know why?

1211
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:16,700
That's because of digital rights management and illegal, file sharing and all this stuff.

1212
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,940
You can't share great art anymore.

1213
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,700
No, you got to buy it.

1214
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,300
Ah, well, that was a pretty interesting study, by the way.

1215
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,300
The Dutch study.

1216
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,140
Well, let me just bring up that page.

1217
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:34,500
Although details aren't quite fantastic, Dutch ministry of economic affairs, commission

1218
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:42,060
to study, by well-known research company TNO, who do a lot of things for the government.

1219
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,820
But how much Dutch internet users download music movies, games, and what the social and

1220
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:49,020
economic effects of this download it loading are?

1221
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,460
And there's 150 page report, link in the show notes, of course, daily source code.com,

1222
01:25:54,020 --> 01:26:02,220
and there's a whole bunch of information and data, and I'm reading an extrapolation of that

1223
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:10,180
and ours technical page 116, according to our technical report states, the societal

1224
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:14,780
effects of file sharing, the study concludes that the effects are strongly positive because

1225
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:20,020
consumers get to enjoy desirable content and also get to keep their cash to buy other things,

1226
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:24,500
because the consumers save so much more money than the producers lose, the net economic

1227
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,900
effects are positive.

1228
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:31,260
The report also reinforces the truth that unpaid downloads do not translate into lost sales

1229
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:36,100
in anything close to one to one to one ratio, which, of course, would all these lawsuits

1230
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,820
have been about all those kind of stuff that I think they're pretty much given up on it.

1231
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:45,060
It's a fantastic report, something that the music industry should take to heart, and I think

1232
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,340
they will eventually.

1233
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,660
They will see that people are more than willing to buy stuff, more than willing to support

1234
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:55,180
artists, they just don't like being coerced into crappy situations and you know what,

1235
01:26:55,180 --> 01:27:01,580
if you get to, you know, I guarantee you that we have sold thousands of songs through

1236
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:07,860
the hit test, which, of course, even though we keep it to 30 seconds, is still illegal

1237
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:08,860
use of the music.

1238
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:12,700
I guarantee you someone's going to go out and buy the who, just because you heard that

1239
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:15,900
song, which, by the way, this is the version you never hear on the radio anymore.

1240
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:20,140
So it was at six minutes, which is a perfect radio song back from the old days.

1241
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,140
I'll tell you what I did.

1242
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:26,900
I took a piss real quick, then I made some tea, I actually had time to roll up a joint or

1243
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:32,860
what passes for a joint these days because all of London seems to be pretty much dry.

1244
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,580
There's nothing, nothing available.

1245
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:40,020
So I'm down to seeds and stems and scraping from the grinder.

1246
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,900
Ah, but of course, it's an illegal plant.

1247
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,260
It's a fricking weed.

1248
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:50,900
Uh, one more thing here about the lack of outrage in the United States.

1249
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:56,340
Again, in the UK, people are very, very pissed off about the government handing out or allowing

1250
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:01,140
bonuses to be paid to Northern Rock, a effectively nationalized bank that personnel

1251
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,460
as receive bonuses for doing their job for just doing the job.

1252
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,540
So how much did we give to a Chrysler for billion?

1253
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:14,660
Well, they've now found the international partner in Fiat and no one is out there saying,

1254
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:18,420
okay, wait a minute, if these guys are now merging and they're going to get like 35%

1255
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:22,260
stake in the company, did our money just go to an Italian firm?

1256
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,860
Do we get something back?

1257
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,380
Do we have a market value?

1258
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,500
No one's asking about that.

1259
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,140
No one's talking about it because you can't even keep track of the money anymore.

1260
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,660
It's billion here, billion there.

1261
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:37,300
You know, I'm still, I still hear people stumbling, even on CNBC, I hear them stumbling

1262
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,740
instead of staying billions, they say millions instead of saying trillions, they say millions

1263
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:45,220
or billions, and we're getting used to it, but it just becomes so normal.

1264
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:50,740
Marky Mac, thank you for Twittering me about my safari crash.

1265
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,180
Someone actually, who was it?

1266
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,060
I wrote that down.

1267
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:58,900
Someone sent me the solution to what I had on 818, where safari almost brought down my entire

1268
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,060
big testament, by the way, to the MacBook Pro.

1269
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:07,940
Ero Kusisto, he said, I love how he troubleshot this.

1270
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:13,300
So quickly, Adam, do you happen to have cool iris forming on his picklens plugin installed?

1271
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,460
It's been known to crash safari, you know what?

1272
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:21,780
I did and I uninstalled it and I have not had a problem since knock on wood, of course,

1273
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,140
which is unfortunate because I know the guys at picklens, I like their shit.

1274
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,300
They just got to make it work right on safari.

1275
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:30,820
I don't know what it is about safari, it's a very typical thing.

1276
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:34,820
Just like the Mac is, what can you really put your finger on it?

1277
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,740
What is so nice, what feels so good about it?

1278
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:40,020
Same with safari, it just kind of feels good over firefox.

1279
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,100
And I run firefox, if I have to.

1280
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:46,580
But I don't know for some reason, it just feels better.

1281
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:50,580
So I've been using ends fast, it's built on webkid as far as I understand.

1282
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:56,420
Oh, let me see some stuff I'm saving for tomorrow because there's a lot of stuff I want to talk

1283
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:01,140
with John about Flight 1549, I got some stuff on that.

1284
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,460
Oh, blah blah blah blah, let me...

1285
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:12,260
Maybe we should kind of leave that at that.

1286
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:16,660
Let's take a couple of voicemails, see what we've got here.

1287
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,780
A lazy nation fears Obama will create millions of jobs.

1288
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:25,980
The most neonium radio news, this is the oil redland reporting.

1289
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:30,980
Today, President-elect Barack Obama struck fear in the hearts of workers across the

1290
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:36,180
U.S. who have grown accustomed to weekly unemployment checks and constant idleness.

1291
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:40,580
Many say they never asked Obama to return them to a way of life that would require

1292
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,580
leaving the house every day.

1293
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:45,580
The former auto worker Carl Lang is one of them.

1294
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:49,780
The next thing you know, he's going to make everyone volunteer their time, the charitable

1295
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,780
hauses.

1296
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:51,780
He's out of control.

1297
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:57,460
Southerners, in particular, expressed the greatest outrage over Obama's call to action by hurling

1298
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:00,780
bowls of two-day-old grits at their television screen.

1299
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:04,180
Go ahead, Redland, for the onion, radio news.

1300
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:08,740
For over 350 years, the onion newspaper has given you the day's news.

1301
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:12,380
Now the onions, our dumb world, Atlas of the Planet Earth, explains what it all means at

1302
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,380
bookstores everywhere.

1303
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,380
Yeah, let them have the little plug there.

1304
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,380
Oh, you know what?

1305
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,860
I've been getting some grief from headquarters.

1306
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:26,620
They say, Adam, you've got so many people listening, but you don't always mention the sponsors.

1307
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:34,500
And in the case of every other independent producer who works with mevio, they receive

1308
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:39,900
the commission or the bounty or the payment or sometimes as a special marketing fee associated

1309
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,020
with it of all of the sponsors.

1310
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:46,220
I don't go straight back into the company and I would really appreciate if you're

1311
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,860
going to make use of any of the following products or services.

1312
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:56,460
If you would, please use, if not my code, go to meviooffers.com where you can get the best

1313
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:02,540
deals on the anywhere on the internet and of course over retail, the best prices.

1314
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:07,020
Because we go out and we negotiate and we don't just take a deal from go daddy, we negotiate

1315
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,060
the absolute lowest price.

1316
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,660
So here's what you can do.

1317
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:20,340
We've got finish line, which sells sports apparel, Adidas, Puma, Nike, 15% off of a purchase

1318
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:27,060

1319
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,380
which there are a lot of success stories out there about eHarmony boy.

1320
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,380
I'll tell you that.

1321
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:35,140
If you sign up for three months, you get one month free using my code.

1322
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:40,420
All of these codes and links are in the show notes of daily source code.com, brooksdone.com,

1323
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:43,900
lots of great gadgets if you look at it, pick up something, you know, kind of like outdoorsy

1324
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,900
stuff.

1325
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:51,420
If you want to meet the monitor, I can give you a discount, 10% pet co, now pet co is pretty

1326
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:58,540
interesting because pet supplies are very expensive, I find we've always had pets and

1327
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:04,260
to be able to get 10% off any order and free shipping on orders over $65 is a big deal.

1328
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,300
budget rental cars, $30 off the weekly rental or 10% off any amount if you use my coupon

1329
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,300
code.

1330
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:16,580
And of course, the two Mac daddy's 35th free songs, no obligation whatsoever at eNusic.com

1331
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:21,540
if you use my code and 30% off at godadad.com, still tons of people using my code, although

1332
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:27,540
I think that in general, people just save money and there's less domain name buying going

1333
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:28,540
on out there.

1334
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,900
So I expect them to come up with a new offer pretty soon.

1335
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,460
I know that we're in conversations with them.

1336
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:38,260
I hope so because they're a great company and they they do provide a fantastic service.

1337
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:45,740
I just bought two domain names myself, the other day I bought throw in the O dot com.

1338
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:51,140
So I got throw in the O all one word dot com and then throwing dash to the dash O dot

1339
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:55,500
com and Johnson to work and I have an idea we're going to do with that.

1340
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:02,300
So anytime you have any one of those products of services in mind, I'd really appreciate

1341
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:07,740
if you considered using that because you help out our little company where a small not even

1342
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:12,380
quite a medium size company and it will be appreciated.

1343
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,820
Hey Adam, it's a topic right Adam's here.

1344
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,820
Oh my god.

1345
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:17,820
Tom McIncite.logsbut.com.

1346
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,420
Yeah, I know it's been a long time since I called in.

1347
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,860
Sorry about that been really busy.

1348
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:26,180
So I took so long.

1349
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:27,900
I figured I'd play your comment twice.

1350
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,860
Or the comment from CSB the other day about the Russian and Ukrainian natural gas supply dispute.

1351
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:31,860
Yeah, but before I wanted to mention something like that.

1352
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:32,860
Why?

1353
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:33,860
Why does it do this?

1354
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:34,860
It's something that's right.

1355
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:35,860
That's tough.

1356
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:37,860
Atomic Insights shouldn't be doing this.

1357
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,540
Yeah, I know it's been a long time since I called in.

1358
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:41,540
Sorry about that crap.

1359
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,540
Really busy.

1360
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:43,540
Sorry.

1361
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:44,540
I took so long.

1362
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:45,540
I figured I'd play your comment twice.

1363
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:51,660
Or the comment from CSB the other day about the Russian and Ukrainian natural gas supply dispute.

1364
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,660
Yeah.

1365
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:56,700
So what I wanted to say is unlike a Sarah Palin where I live.

1366
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,820
I can actually see Russians from here.

1367
01:34:58,820 --> 01:34:59,820
Real Russians in Chelsea.

1368
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:02,140
I can see them right there.

1369
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:07,500
One of the effects of that dispute has been a renewed conversation in Europe about the use

1370
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:13,540
of nuclear power as a way to reduce dependence upon Russian gas.

1371
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:17,900
Bulgaria and Slovakia, which both own nuclear plans that they were forced to shut down

1372
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:22,140
on the upon accession into the EU are talking about restarting some of those plans.

1373
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,140
Yep.

1374
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:26,540
Poland is talking about building its first nuclear plans.

1375
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:32,860
And Germany's politicians are rethinking their existing agreement to shut down the 17

1376
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,700
nuclear plans that has operating today because that shutdown would make them far more

1377
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,580
dependent on Russian gas.

1378
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:39,580
One more thing.

1379
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,780
Do a certain a web for backyard nukes.

1380
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:42,780
Yeah.

1381
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,380
Remember that title you applied to our conversation back in May 2000.

1382
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:50,220
I declare buoyancy making a way it's way around the world and several companies have

1383
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:54,820
announced products that fit into the category of backyard nukes.

1384
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:55,820
Great hair.

1385
01:35:55,820 --> 01:36:00,300
Hope you win and I still work for you if you're an American.

1386
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:05,180
I am an American citizen proud to be one absolutely atomic rod.

1387
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:10,700
Our nuclear atomic energy savant and I do appreciate the service you provide to us.

1388
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,340
I'm not quite sure what you do but I know that you've worked in nuclear submarines

1389
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:18,980
and you work I believe in the Navy or in some form of services and of course of course

1390
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:22,660
of course of the fact that you say this and you recognize it man I love you for it big

1391
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:25,380
time big up to the man.

1392
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,380
Okay.

1393
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:30,060
It's getting kind of warm in here and running out of a little bit of steam.

1394
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:33,340
There's a couple of things I did want to there's one thing I wanted to play for you.

1395
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:38,780
It's a YouTube video and this is one other abomination that I want to bring to your

1396
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:43,620
attention because of course.

1397
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:49,380
Obama said pull everyone out of rock and everyone's like you know this is the guy's

1398
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:53,180
doing it he's pulling everyone out of a rock you know regardless of whether he'll still

1399
01:36:53,180 --> 01:37:00,180
leave 40,000 people there regardless of how long it will take to pull everyone out of

1400
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:06,420
a rock he is putting everyone into Afghanistan and here's a little you know if you've

1401
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:12,060
got a recorder then and I'd love to have a whole bunch of these sound clips you could

1402
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:16,620
send either mail email them to me directly or you could send them to or just drop them

1403
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:21,420
that's what you should do drop them baby drop it like it's hot drop.io slash daily source

1404
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:27,500
code drop.io slash daily source code drop.io slash daily source code now you won't get it

1405
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,900
out of your head will you interview your friends your family and say what kind of the

1406
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:36,140
government do we live in in the United States let's see how many people say democracy

1407
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:43,820
versus Republic and let's see if they can explain the difference and then ask them why are

1408
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:51,020
we in Afghanistan just a simple answer I mean our representatives have sent tens of thousands

1409
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:57,340
of boys and girls men and women in harms way and endangering hundreds of thousands of

1410
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:07,660
not millions of Afghanis who are dying for the stupidest reasons ask him ask him why you should

1411
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:12,220
know why and I have my own thoughts and I have my own reasoning and I know what they're saying

1412
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:18,060
but just ask anyone and then record that and drop that let me know what you think so here's Adam

1413
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:24,300
Kur Kokesh he is of the Iraq veterans against the war I've been to Iraq I've seen what how it

1414
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:31,340
affected Dutch marines you know marines are always supposed to be the the toughest the strongest

1415
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:39,740
the first the most brave and I have they've cried in my arms literally because they were just

1416
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:44,380
so fucked up about what they were seeing what what was happening and the the conflicting

1417
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:50,540
mission and not understanding why they were there listen to what Adam Kokesh has to say

1418
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:59,500
24 hours we're gonna make it and we make it and we do this and we survived eight years of

1419
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:08,460
the Bush administration is that reason to celebrate my name is Adam Kokesh I served as a

1420
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:13,420
sergeant I'm a regular civil affairs team in the Flusher Act from February September of 2004

1421
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:18,300
and because of what I saw and because of what I experienced in the tragedy and the crime

1422
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:24,620
that is the ongoing occupation of Iraq I came home and I joined Iraq veterans against the war

1423
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:29,580
and from our inception we have been caught for three things first and foremost and a meeting

1424
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:38,380
withdrawal of all occupying forces from Iraq second full benefits for attorney veterans regardless of

1425
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:43,580
discharge status and support because we got troops coming home with post traumatic stress disorder

1426
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:48,620
because of what they've seen and then they get bad conduct discharges in our denied

1427
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:53,980
the health care that they're entitled to because of a disease caused by the war that they served

1428
01:39:53,980 --> 01:40:00,380
in and that in and of itself is criminal the third thing we call for is reparations for the Iraqi

1429
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:05,660
people now I served in civil affairs and one of the things I'm most proud of that I did in Iraq

1430
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:10,860
is that I didn't genuinely try to help the Iraqi people what we were doing and we gave out

1431
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:16,220
solution payments after the siege of Flusher trying to compensate people when they had relatives that

1432
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:23,180
died from bombs dropped from U.S. war planes and they had houses destroyed and we gave them $2500

1433
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:27,980
if they're if they're son had been killed or their daughter or family member you do some idea

1434
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:35,100
of the way that the American military values human life in Iraq and it's very disturbing

1435
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:42,540
that's the message we're sending to the Iraqi people now we're here to sue Bush and

1436
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:49,900
sue Bush out of office and we are here in solidarity in just in case you couldn't hear probably

1437
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:55,020
he said shoe bush not sue bush or shoot bush but he's holding up his boots and he's saying to

1438
01:40:55,020 --> 01:41:02,700
shoe bush with my daughter all's the 80 we're the courage to do it to the man's face

1439
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:12,780
and Bush at the audacity to say I don't know what his beef is well I know we know

1440
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:18,060
you know that that's funny I hadn't even picked up on that one because of course I didn't really

1441
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:23,820
show that on the news they only showed the the guy throwing the shoe I've got his name you just

1442
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:29,180
mentioned it but Bush indeed said I don't know what his beef is well how about a million Iraqis

1443
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:36,060
dead mother fucker we all know all's the 80 was doing that on behalf of the Iraqi people

1444
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:43,020
not just on his own angst and anguish but on behalf of the Iraqi people who have suffered so

1445
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:49,180
greatly under this occupation which is such a crime we now have over a million dead Iraqis who

1446
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:54,540
died violent death as a direct result of this occupation we have over two and a half million

1447
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:59,260
internally displaced and two and a half million externally displaced and Bush doesn't know

1448
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:07,180
what his beef is well we're here in solidarity with all his 80 and I'm here in solidarity with the

1449
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:12,540
Iraqi people who have suffered at the hands of this administration and the occupation that we

1450
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:18,460
in Iraq friends against the war once a part of and for me it is a form of penitence to come here

1451
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:24,300
and say that I'm doing this in solidarity with all of them and now well it is reason to

1452
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:30,300
celebrate that we have survived eight years of the Bush administration and the criminality of that

1453
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:37,580
and and we are here we're in solidarity with all the people who have suffered under this administration

1454
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:43,980
from Iraq to Afghanistan throughout the world through the imperial policies of this administration

1455
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:57,020
so I'm here that I got a shoe for Bush but I got to say really I don't think this is time for celebration

1456
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:04,940
here here Wilson and FDR when they are inaugurated did not celebrate because they were

1457
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:10,460
troops in harm's way and by the way they didn't have a nice salmon lunch either they had a cold

1458
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:15,980
soup because that was the right thing to do it was quite disgusting when I think about it about the

1459
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:22,620
grandeur and the cost of the inauguration about the celebration you know what it's sad it's actually

1460
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:31,420
I'm at that moment I was in a way also very disgusted and disappointed in my fellow countrymen

1461
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:39,260
because we have tens of thousands almost 100,000 troops and contractors all over the world

1462
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:45,580
killing people were there on no business but to serve corporate agendas and we're back home celebrating

1463
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:52,780
Yivee there goes Bush fuck am let's celebrate let's eat great I was disturbing

1464
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:58,940
FDR served cold chicken no there you go not super chicken told you and solidarity with the

1465
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:08,700
troops that were in harm's way and we are about to inaugurate a president who has said that he wants to

1466
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:15,820
end the war in rock but has said specifically that what he means by that is that he is going to

1467
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:24,860
keep a minimum a minimum of 40,000 troops in a rock and definitely listen to that so when you repeat

1468
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:33,260
the incorrect meme the lie that Obama is taking us out of Iraq I want you to remember he is not

1469
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:39,180
there will be 40,000 troops who will remain there you can look it up it's published they don't

1470
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:45,180
cover it up the news media just takes the oh we're so cool in Obama rocks and we're going to

1471
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:52,060
take the troops out of Iraq finally on permanent bases with an increased reliance on private

1472
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:59,660
contract of mercenaries like blackwater and he's going to have a surge in Afghanistan of at least 30,000

1473
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:05,340
troops and we have seen firsthand we have learned the lesson from the Bush administration that

1474
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:12,300
occupation is a crime no matter where it happens no matter what propaganda you use to justify it

1475
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:21,580
occupation is a crime and then it's not going to end with a Bush administration we still have a lot of work

1476
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:31,340
to do and I'll tell you what on behalf of the marine that's going to die in Iraq in the next 24 hours

1477
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:38,300
on behalf of the Iraqis that are going to continue their suffering under the Obama administration

1478
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:45,980
on behalf of the 30,000 troops that are going to face threats to their life in Afghanistan

1479
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:51,420
and the people of Afghanistan who are going to suffer doubly under a surge over there

1480
01:45:54,220 --> 01:46:01,260
I'm saving this other one for Obama hell yeah that's a patriot ladies and gentlemen

1481
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:05,660
and don't be afraid to speak up and speak your mind about your president

1482
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:08,860
it's what Americans all about

1483
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:55,900
it's like good things of more than anyone could be as good for them just a little fool of

1484

1509
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,960
believe there will be protests all around europe so uh... find

1510
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,520
your local their plenty of websites

1511
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:09,080
and uh... if it uh... in some cases it's against the bankers in some cases against the

1512
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:12,280
government some cases against both some cases it's still

1513
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:16,280
against the israeli aggression some cases against uh...

1514
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:20,840
palestinian aggression but essentially it's pissed off civilians

1515
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:25,240
and i think we need to show some more of that

1516
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:29,560
and do not forget to contact your representative if you live in a country that has

1517
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:33,320
a government that actually has representatives that are supposed to do something

1518
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:35,240
just keep pestering them

1519
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:38,840
you know even online marketers know that if you keep calling eventually you'll

1520
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:42,440
