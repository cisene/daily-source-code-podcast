00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie, 8-1-4.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
$60 million worth of airplanes wrapped by aspirin.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The next generation brings you content in my ears.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We don't need no digging trees in.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'd like to think I'm flying into the heat jar.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Fantastic.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey, hello to my little friend.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm a carry. I'm editing source code.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're such an inspiration from the weather.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I will never ever choose to be.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're so mad.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They always remain a show.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're how you say.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The cows abandon you.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I know you're the only one you're crazy.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm a human.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're so mad.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're just enc bamboo carries for you.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
For you think we're going to run away.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You don't need no dig of your laughter.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have a mind to ask you where I'm from.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:24,920

course code episode 814 coming to you from the brand new curry terrace in southwest London

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,560
in the United Kingdom, which of course is the eastern part of Gitmo Nation, hey everybody,

32
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,400
how you doing first show coming from the, well second show really because no agenda started

33
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:26,440
off the new set up the new studio, which suck tremendous donkey balls, everything

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,880
got screwed up, so I had a really good long think about it and I rewired everything,

35
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,680
I was just actually looking at the chat on the phone bridge. Now if you don't know how to

36
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,960
call in, we have a special conference room where you can participate in the show later on,

37
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,200
you can find all the information at curry.com. There's a link on the right hand side at

38
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,080
curry.com, which says DSC live info, click on that, it'll tell you how to call it, to talk

39
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,160
show, which I do you need and what I was seeing in the chat is that people were saying

40
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,080
that they could hear my voice fine, but the minute the music kicked in, it sounded really

41
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,520
static. He not quite sure what's going on there. Well, I just have to have to mess around

42
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,360
with it. Actually, it was, you know, before I get to all that, let me tell you, it's been

43
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:22,000
a pretty, pretty crazy week. Hold on a second. Actually, a little bit over a week now.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,440
Let's see, we had the best of the Charlie 2008 that was Ray, of course, put that together.

45
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,720
Actually, I got a voice comment about that. I'd like to play for you.

46
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,200
Amen. It's been a pretty one night or right now. It's about I am. But, you know, I'm

47
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:56,000
going to stick with the DSC. And, you know, they ran on the Charlie tribute and as a year,

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
awesome awesome stuff. They're ready. Very cool. One thing I have to say is, you got to

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,640
at least one more playing trip on the Charlie. Maybe more. I'd like more, but at least one more

50
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,440
this year, boss. I just, as I was awesome. A lot of great memories. Hey, you know, if you're

51
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,720
right, man, about the 2009's going to be a proven round. So, I can see how it goes, but until

52
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,800
then, give them more evidence. But hey, I'm open. Give me what you've got right here. Love

53
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,120
you get it. Hope you'll win. Yeah, man. And here's to 2009. Thanks.

54
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,760
Yo, it's going to be certainly a very interesting year. But let me go back to last year first,

55
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,160
just to collect my thoughts. So, we had that ray on the Charlie, the best of the source code

56
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,600
2008, which I loved listening to. I listened to it in two parts, partially, while packing up

57
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,240
the old studio at the old house. And, of course, unpacking in the new studio. The move,

58
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,080
I'd have to say, was we underestimated it severely. Now, this was not just a regular move.

59
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,400
It was a complete reboot of our lives. We like to do this from time to time. Last time was almost

60
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,200
five years ago. And that wasn't really a reboot because we dragged a whole bunch of stuff with

61
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,440
us, which you put into storage. I essentially was paying for a second house for our stuff, which

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,440
we never looked at. Never had no idea was in there. We went through all that clean that out. I mean,

63
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,160
we discarded so much stuff, particularly paperwork. So, I've got rid of all of that.

64
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,080
And then we moved, and you know, the stuff that was in the old house in the, in the manner,

65
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,040
we got rid of a lot of that as well. Literally gave it away. You can't even sell this stuff anymore.

66
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,160
No one wants furniture, even antiques. People just aren't interested. They're rather by a flat

67
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,160
pack from IKEA. That's the way to go. And so, what was it? The 29th, they packed everything up,

68
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,760
the 30th was the first shipment that went up to London from Gilford. And it kind of didn't

69
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,840
stop from there. It was literally nonstop. Now, this place is four stories. So, and we have the

70
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,360
top floor designated as, okay, that's where we're going to store all the stuff that once again,

71
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,240
we have no place to put. Or, you know, the Christmas tree ornaments, that kind of stuff. And my

72
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,440
boxes of wires, boy, I've discarded a lot of crap, and still have boxes of wires left over. And

73
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:36,560
power supplies and cables and ethernet and USB for how about instruction manuals. Anyway,

74
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,640
you have no idea how much crap you'd you wind up gathering and schlepping around with you.

75
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,440
So, that's kind of done with. Then, you know, I still had to do mevio today. I'd taken a couple

76
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
days off and I thought, ah, you know, I'll just take two days off, because that is actually quite a

77
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,040
bit of work of, of whittled it down to anywhere between three and five hours a day of work,

78
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
but getting faster. I learned an enormous amount. I've got a

79
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,840
a Mac xenon quad hoopla machine here now. And I couldn't figure out why it wasn't going very fast.

80
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,880
It's like, why is it? There's the rendering going so slowly. It turns out that I had thought I

81
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,720
dragged a, an as a folder full of assets over onto the over onto the new edit machine,

82
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,920
but it actually created an alias. So, the reason why it was taking so long to to do stuff and

83
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,320
render it because it was pulling this data from my laptop through the Wi-Fi hub. Yeah, no wonder it

84
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
was taken hours. Took a little while for me to figure that one out to find out exactly what was

85
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,680
wrong there. And then I got a, like, a little bit of the flu. And I once, I don't know, flu is really

86
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,480
the right word. It was definitely a stomach bug. Let's call it that. But just for a day,

87
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:57,920
had a little, had a significant fever, I'll say, for about 24 hours and kind of started to come

88
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,880
out of that funk yesterday. And today is a day where as far as I know, we have no meetings,

89
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,360
normally we have meetings scheduled around 5 o'clock, which is 9 a.m. San Francisco time. So,

90
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,360
perfect timing to roll out to a source code. And we got people on the phone brood. Let me just,

91
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:25,360
let me see. Who's this? Hello, Jamie. Hey, Jamie, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Excellent.

92
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Now, I see that you're in the chat room there and you're kind of talking away with people.

93
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,440
You say it sounds fuzzy. slightly. And it was, um, during the song, it became almost complete

94
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,680
static where it was sort of coming in and out. And, but mostly all static. But once you started talking

95
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,840
and then when you played the audio comment, everything, you know, mostly sounds fine.

96
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,280
Is it loud enough? Maybe maybe I'm over modulating it or something. Is it, is it,

97
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,240
is the sound that's coming through the phone loud? Volume was fine for me. I actually turned the

98
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,800
volume down on my phone when you were playing the audio comment. Okay, so I'm going to turn all

99
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
that stuff down a little bit. Maybe that's what's going on there. It's, you know what? I installed

100
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,880
the new version of Skype and it has some kind of automatic gain control in there, which I can't

101
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,280
seem to find where to turn it off. So maybe that's it. Jamie, where are you calling from, actually?

102
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm in Bergen County, New Jersey. Oh, near my old, uh, my old stomping grounds.

103
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,440
Yes, I live in East Rutherford. I work in Chicago. And have you been listening to the show for a while?

104
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,120
Two years? Hmm. I got to tell you, uh, you are, I believe the first woman to call in in,

105
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
ever since we, in fact, I don't know if I have any female listeners anymore. You may be yet, Jamie.

106
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
Oh, I'm listening.

107
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,520
Here's her out there. Anything in particular you want to talk about today, because I'm kind of going to

108
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,120
keep it a bit of an, uh, you know, open topic show since there's so much. I mean, I, I can't even start

109
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
to go back, uh, into last week, all the things that have happened, all the, all the news that

110
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,120
is taking place. Anything in particular caught your eye? Um, well, just from the world of, at large,

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,640
anything you want, Jamie? Well, actually, um, something happened today that I thought was spectacular.

112
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,080
Actually, it was last night, um, on Twitter, I follow at Armano, ARMA, ARMA, ARMA, N-O.

113
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,640
And he actually, he and his wife have taken in a family, it's a woman and her three children.

114
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,960
She left her husband, um, because it was an abusive situation. And he posted a PayPal link

115
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:41,200
and in less than 24 hours, it's up to almost $12,000, has been raised. And, um, and this is

116
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,480
decided to see how, you know, the power of this. And this is to get them back on their feet and

117
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,600
uh, get them going again. Right. They're trying to, you know, locate, um, an apartment for them, so they

118
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,520
can, you know, move into the wrong place. So I'm, I'm so touched by the whole thing. I was happy

119
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,720
to donate. And I think a lot of other people are as well. Excellent. Give me the, uh, the Twitter,

120
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:11,120
name again to follow. So if people can write that down, uh, it's Armano, ARMA, N-O, ARMA, N-O.

121
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,760
Armano at Twitter. So just go follow Armano and, um, and contribute, I say. That, that is, uh,

122
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,480
that is a pretty good gesture. We're going to be helping each other a lot more in the future.

123
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,240
That's for sure. All right, Jamie, you're going to hang out for a bit? Yeah, it's a for you. Excellent.

124
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Thanks.

125
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,240
When they're tired, it goes, you know, it's got to be.

126
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
You're made and grown.

127
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah.

128
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:23,240
When you're back, I go. I fly down to my square floor. I want to strike all the big red

129
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,240
words. I'm a little black boy.

130
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Don't you just want to be? Don't wear no shots in shoes.

131
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:42,240
With nothing good to believe, all the time you know.

132
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:50,240
With nothing good to believe, all the time you know.

133
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm going to take it myself for whole. I'm going to lay down in it till I satisfying my show.

134
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Oh, let the world pass by me.

135
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,240
No, I should push it full, shake it finally.

136
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,240
And if you don't come in, all's the ball, I say, no.

137
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:05,240
When back, I'll return to my square floor. I guess I'll take my hands.

138
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

139
00:16:35,240 --> 00:17:02,820
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, some kind of one of those musicians who were among them,

140
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:09,820
now it's having problems with safari and what I was thinking of doing is I have

141
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:15,140
two hit tests still left over from actually have the new years hit test and I have a new

142
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,500
one that young sent me I'm basically two behind and I was thinking if people could actually

143
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,020
hear it in the in on the conference bridge then it would be very cool to have everyone

144
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,220
participate and actually play along with the hit test and now of course I'm having troubles

145
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,380
even downloading it so let me see if that fixed the problem ah yes there we go

146
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:45,380
um let me see uh why don't I uh unmute everybody who's called in here for a second

147
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:52,740
hold on is that uh everybody okay so you're uh you're unmuted we have a Spudboy Michael

148
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:05,340
Dell and uh Jamie is probably still on yeah how about Spudboy and Michael Dell you're right

149
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:12,140
it's the question and I am the real Michael Dell that's not the answer to that

150
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,940
oh man you're you're calling on Skype I just I got to put you back on mute it's so horrible

151
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,660
by the way if you want to listen to the show you should you probably not the best

152
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:30,660
thing to listen to it um through the through the talk show system talk show system um that's

153
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,820
basically a Skype out that I'm doing into talk show so that's always going to sound pretty

154
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,420
crap um so it it's better to uh to listen to the stream if possible now this is going

155
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,060
to be interesting I'm actually I'm going to do this hit test those of you on the phone

156
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:54,260
and again everyone who uh everyone who's dialed in now is uh unmuted hold on a second

I'll ask you just to see what are you doing in New Year.

165
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,500
New Year's Eve.

166
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Tell me.

167
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, romantic.

168
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
What the hell was it, young?

169
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,500
You're doing New Year's Eve in the version by Gladys Knight and the Princess Answer number one.

170
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Alright, then.

171
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
And this is Answer number two.

172
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,500
No more champagne and the morning seems so...

173
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh, that's my wife.

174
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Is that not?

175
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Yes, that is.

176
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Sounds like her.

177
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Sounds like her.

178
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Sounds like her.

179
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Sounds like her.

180
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Sounds like her.

181
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Sounds like her.

182
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Sounds like her.

183
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Sounds like her.

184
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Sounds like her.

185
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Sounds like her.

186
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Sounds like her.

187
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Not my wife.

188
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If we turn all the time.

189
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,000
Happy New Year, Eve!

190
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,000
Okay.

191
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is Answer number three.

192
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
One, this is You're too.

193
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
One is right on New Year's Eve.

194
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We'll be with you back in the morning.

195
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, you're here, babe.

196
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And some number three.

197
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You two, New Year's Day.

198
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And that concludes it.

199
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's number one, five, three.

200
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

201
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So Adam?

202
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

203
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
How did you do this week?

204
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, collectively, we all pretty much suck.

205
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, I got New Year's Day.

206
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And Jamie thought she knew number two when of course that was ever.

207
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So better luck on the next one.

208
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It is concludes.

209
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The New Year's edition of the hit-est.

210
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like always, the answer's end, of course.

211
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The iTunes links.

212
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So you can buy the tracks featured on the hit-est online.

213
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Or to be found at hit-est.mevio.com.

214
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Adam, thanks for playing.

215
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Thank you, young.

216
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Everyone else.

217
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Thank you for listening.

218
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Next week, I hope to be back for not a hit-est.

219
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So until then, have fun.

220
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Take care.

221
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Think with your hearts.

222
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And happy New Year, everybody.

223
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Bye-bye.

224
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was just looking through a couple of my notes while young was wrapping it up there.

225
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And with all this stuff going on in Gaza right now, which man, it's unbelievable the way the mainstream coverage is being portrayed.

226
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
At least when I'm seeing here on the BBC and the United Kingdom, here's a couple things I've noticed.

227
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And it leads into this article, which is from Middle East Online.

228
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Of course, everything's sourced from the source code drop.au slash daily source code.

229
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So first of all, what is interesting at least to note is that all the footage is primarily of horrific images.

230
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And they always set it up by saying, some of our viewers may be disturbed by what you're about to see.

231
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Now, God forbid we show a nipple, a breast, or a dick on television.

232
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No, or people having sex, doing something good and fun and good for you.

233
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
No, no, no, no, of course not.

234
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No, we'll just disclaim the murder and mayhem that's going on.

235
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Absolutely horrific images that we're getting from from Gaza.

236
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And then they'll cut back to the guy standing on the hill outside the perimeter and you see the Israeli tanks going in.

237
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And from time to time, you'll see one of those bottle rockets that Hamas apparently is building themselves, shoot up.

238
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But you never see any of the destruction of the Hamas rockets. I haven't seen it.

239
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm sure it's there. And I know that three or four may be more civilians in Israel have been killed by these rockets.

240
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But they never show it, which is just interesting to note, or they'll show like a hole in the ground.

241
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And then you see this, I saw a rocket the other day literally, you could see the weld along the fins.

242
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It was a completely home-built, but they're just not showing that, which is interesting to note.

243
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
They then always show the Israeli soldiers being buried.

244
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You know, it's where they show the ceremony.

245
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What you also don't see is the protests that are taking place.

246
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There were 12,000 people the other day at the Israeli embassy here in London.

247
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And they were getting pretty rough with the police.

248
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And now the new thing, which is, I guess it's a worldwide meme, is the shoe throwing, which of course, already was an insult worldwide in Islamic culture.

249
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But now it's being pretty much taken over by all these protesters.

250
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And they're throwing their shoes at the Israeli embassy.

251
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And you don't see any of that. You don't see, as I have not seen a single bit of footage.

252
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I saw something online on a newspaper website. I mean, people are reporting on it, but the majority of these reports are exactly what I'm telling you is being shown.

253
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You see huge destruction in Gaza.

254
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And then this prompt is usually an interview with an Israeli official who says,

255
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, we don't care. Look, if they want to sit in UN school buildings and use that as a shield, we don't care.

256
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And I understand where everybody's coming from in this one, honestly.

257
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But there's something very, very emissed with the information about it that we're getting.

258
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It just, it doesn't add up.

259
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And under all of the, you almost got to think, and this is of warning,

260
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
oh, man, do have a little warning. Maybe I should do a warning sound here. Maybe I should do this more often. Here we go.

261
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Conspiracy alert, conspiracy alert, conspiracy alert.

262
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Maybe this thing is being escalated at this very moment for specific reason of timing.

263
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Now, we know that we're still a few weeks away from the inauguration of our new president Obama,

264
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
who I got to talk about that press conference he did yesterday.

265
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
If you haven't seen that, you should definitely check it out on the drop,

266
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
because there's some things that are kind of weird, even Patricia noticed some stuff.

267
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But anyway, I just got to wonder that this is to distract attention perhaps away from something else,

268
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
or maybe, and again, it's just conspiracy thinking on my part.

269
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Maybe just to show us that some people have had much worse. Maybe that's it.

270
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But whatever it is, it's definitely a combination of the media,

271
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
selling us a particular angle, a particular story, making us feel a certain way,

272
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and it is grabbing the majority of all of the headlines.

273
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Now, here is the final thing I want to say that I find interesting in all of this,

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
where is Osama bin Laden? Where is Osama bin Laden?

275
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I mean, with what he, of course, would consider to be atrocities,

276
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
anyone who loves life and human beings sees that this is atrocities on all sides of the conflict.

277
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Why is he not out there screaming and yelling? Why is it the so-called al-Qaeda deputy

278
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
who has to come out and say, we're going to get you for this?

279
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Where is Osama bin Laden? The only thing I can think is that he's probably dead.

280
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We'll hit the phones in a second if you want to talk about this situation,

281
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and guys, I'd love to hear your opinion. This is the source code, 814,

282
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
with some good advice from the chili peppers. Certainly in these days,

283
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
from this information, rules the airways.

284
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Throw away your television, time to make this clean decision,

285
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
last awaits for its collision now.

286
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's a repeat of a story told.

287
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

288
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's a repeat of a story told.

289
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

290
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

291
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's a repeat with fatigue, just lay the plate for its contagious

292
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:06,000
for the plug and take the stages. Throw away your television now.

293
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Throw away your television, take the loose off your ambition,

294
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
return, return, return, return, return.

295
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

296
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

297
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

298
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

299
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

300
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

301
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

302
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

303
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

304
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

305
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Throw away your television, take the loose off your ambition,

306
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:44,000
return, return, return, return, return.

307
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's a repeat and it's getting old.

308
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's a repeat and it's a repeat and it's getting old.

309
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,360
it's a repeat hell yeah actually while that was playing I remember there was a fantastic

310
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,480
video on on drop dot IO slash daily source code and this isn't video yet who knows one day

311
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,840
I might put all that together as well but baby steps folks baby steps this is the title of it

312
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,160
a girl with balls blocks Israeli soldiers and even the audio is really compelling this is

313
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,520
which sounds like a western most like American young woman who was literally standing

314
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,240
opposite Israeli soldiers who are shooting at at children and she just stands there and well have

315
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,200
a listen for yourself that this is absolutely outrageous they're standing behind barbed wire

316
00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:00,720
so by the way the reason why you're hearing a voice over and a foreign language is because

317
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:10,640
you won't see this stuff on television in in gitmonation all right so these kids are all standing

318
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,240
around and then these Israeli soldiers start shooting at them I don't know what they're shooting

319
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,760
probably the low velocity bullets or maybe rubber bullets it seems like they're making a lot of dust

320
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,360
but it doesn't matter

321
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:37,040
okay so now the kids are throwing stones from across the road

322
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:44,080
now they gotta get to this girl okay yeah it looks like they're rubber bullets still

323
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,440
I should have killed this up earlier now it's kind of confusing if you don't

324
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,360
let's get to that piece come on where is she here here it is this is amazing

325
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,120
all right she's walked right up to them right up to them she's standing in front of a

326
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,760
pointed rifle one polystyl engineer came back I could be don't you understand that

327
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:26,080
that what? If you're sorry back that was just a Whole bag

328
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,080
whole bag she serves Who hiding human use they're going to die

329
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,080
This is amazing.

330
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,080
She's standing right in front of them and they're trying to shoot these kids.

331
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
She's just standing there.

332
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,080
She's pointing his rifle right at her.

333
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
She's putting her hands up.

334
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,080
She stands there.

335
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
She's just standing there.

336
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,080
This is amazing.

337
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,080
And now the Israeli soldier is taking aim.

338
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
You got to take a look at that.

339
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,080
I don't know if that comes across at all on the stream.

340
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Probably not.

341
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
But just outrageous.

342
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
And what courage?

343
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:23,080
So meanwhile our president elect says he's deeply concerned.

344
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Deeply concerned about the loss of life.

345
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Not quite the message of change I was looking to hear from my new president.

346
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:41,080
And we're hearing similar noises from our current president, which is just so completely disappointing.

347
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Chris from Washington.

348
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Yeah.

349
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Hey Chris, how are you doing, man?

350
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
I see in the chat room.

351
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
You're talking away.

352
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,080
You've got an opinion here on what's going on in Gaza.

353
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I do want to say, hey, I'm glad I could finally be awake on time.

354
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Jesus is too early in the morning here.

355
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Yeah.

356
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
On the other work.

357
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,080
No, I just think they were not seeing the whole truth as usual.

358
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Because you see I'm seeing in their five miles away.

359
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Just watching, you're not talking to people in Gaza.

360
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
They're not seeing if they're getting aid.

361
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
They're not seeing if they're getting food.

362
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
So you know, as usual, you're seeing what they, you know,

363
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
and what it's to see.

364
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Absolutely.

365
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,080
And what everybody needs to do is go to alternative news sources.

366
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,080
And I, of course, would recommend drop.io slash daily source code.

367
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Because, you know, when you see video like this, it's a embedded YouTube video.

368
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,080
I mean, it's, it's a lot easier to bring some things into context as to what's actually happening where

369
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,080
the mainstream press is not able to gain access to.

370
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Oh, yeah.

371
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,080
If you're just a little driver or Twitter, you know, if you're going to get like the real news,

372
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,080
you're going to get people's home video accounts of the posting kind of letter.

373
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Families know they're okay.

374
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,080
You know, so you're going to actually get some, some real on the ground step.

375
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Exactly.

376
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
All right.

377
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Chris and Washington stay on the line.

378
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Woody 426 asked me if I know a British corporation named Wollsley.

379
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
What would that be about Woody 426?

380
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Uh, don't settle county throughout Europe and America and county.

381
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Oh, man.

382
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,080
You know, I, I, I wish I could hear you, but the Skype connection is just just degraded to poorly.

383
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,080
So, uh, type it into the chat and I'll see if, uh, see if I can answer it for you that way.

384
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Here we go.

385
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Comic strip.

386
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Comic strip.

387
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Comic strip.

388
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Comic strip.

389
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Comic strip.

390
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Comic strip.

391
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Comic strip.

392
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
Comic strip.

393
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Comic strip.

394
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
Comic strip.

395
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Comic strip.

396
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,080
It's time for New Year's Message from my very own CSB.

397
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Hello.

398
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Hello.

399
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Hello.

400
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Hello.

401
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,080
Here is CSB, you correspondents.

402
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,080
So every six months, new EU country takes over EU presidency.

403
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:07,080
And in 2009, it will be Czech Republic in first half and then Abba.

404
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
I mean, it's with it.

405
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Maybe laughs with it.

406
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Okay.

407
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Not many people know that many beers, including Budweiser and Pilsner, uh, originated in Czech Republic.

408
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,080
And generally, I had 100% agree with position of Czechs on everything.

409
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,080
So my message to EU is shut the dark up and listen to Czechs.

410
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,080
You know, I, I really wish I understood what he was talking about.

411
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
It was something about beer.

412
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
That's for sure.

413
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:47,080
So, um, this was kind of interesting.

414
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,080
A press conference called by the office of the president elect non-existent office.

415
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Doesn't exist.

416
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Made up.

417
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,080
But it's, uh, our future president Barack Obama sitting there with,

418
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,080
I recognize Roman Manuel who throughout the entire press conference is kind of like nodding

419
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,080
at people, uh, apparently in the audience and smiling and acknowledging whatever they're saying to them.

420
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:17,080
And some dude right next to him, uh, it's probably, uh, what's his name, Axel something.

421
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,080
He was just sitting there where the really unhappy frown the whole time doesn't say anything.

422
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,080
And then some woman who comes into the shot, whoever Barack says something,

423
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,080
she's like nodding or head almost like, yeah, he's, he's getting it right.

424
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Just really crazy.

425
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,080
But, um, I showed this to Patricia and I said, you know, this, this is really, really funky.

426
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Just look at this video.

427
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:40,080
And the first thing she said is, well, listen, listen to the audio for a second.

428
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,080
The first thing she said is, why am I hearing all of these old fashioned camera clicks?

429
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
These shutters going off the whole time.

430
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Listen to it.

431
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Yeah, this is, uh, the core of my economic team.

432
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:57,080
And actually, I'm just, I'm just noticing the video starts off with a shot of, uh,

433
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,080
let me say, let me just roll it back a little bit.

434
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,080
It starts off with a shot of how many I'm going to count them here.

435
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Uh, three photographers.

436
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
And then it pans to the right.

437
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
And then there's an edit.

438
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
And then it's basically a new shot.

439
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,080
But the sound of the cameras, listen to this.

440
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Yeah, this is, uh, the core of my economic team.

441
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Uh, and the message is meeting.

442
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,080
And the sound of these cameras continues throughout the entire press conference.

443
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
It does not stop.

444
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Just listen.

445
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
We are.

446
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
It almost sounds like someone's on a typewriter.

447
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,080
The economy is bad.

448
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
The situation is getting worse.

449
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Now, you know, and, and here's why Patricia commented on it.

450
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
She said, it's funny.

451
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,080
There's someone looking, looking through a curtain in the background.

452
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Uh, it's so amateurish.

453
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Uh, it's so funny.

454
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,080
And he's saying nothing, by the way, excepting going to try and get the, uh,

455
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,080
the stimulus package through Congress before or the day after I'm president.

456
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
That's essentially the entire message.

457
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,080
But the cameras continue.

458
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,080
And on these cameras, electronic don't all, you know,

459
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,080
a press photographer certainly paparazzi.

460
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Don't they all have silent cameras that just take the picture?

461
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I mean, I can understand hearing a flash.

462
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,080
But I'm hearing, you know, seeing, you know, like reflex lens is here.

463
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,080
Uh, by partisan leadership group this afternoon.

464
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,080
And the, the most important message today is that the situation.

465
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Listen to that.

466
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
We've got to act boldly.

467
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
And we've got to act swiftly.

468
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
We cannot delay.

469
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Uh, I said it in my web address is.

470
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Anyway, I, I actually, if I had time, I'd analyze all those clicks and see if it was some kind of a loop, which from time to time it does sound like.

471
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,080
It's weird, you know, it's weird that they had that, that edit in the video, the pan.

472
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,080
And I don't know why other than they just slap and shit together.

473
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,080
And trying to make it look like something actually, uh, official.

474
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
I don't know.

475
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Have a look at that.

476
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,080
It's on the drop drop dot IO slash daily source code.

477
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Oops.

478
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,080
Shipman, we already did that one.

479
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
This is the one I meant to hit.

480
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Hold on a second.

481
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Let me do this.

482
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
There we go.

483
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
You know what?

484
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,080
Instead of that, I got a better idea.

485
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,080
Since I screwed that up already.

486
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I'm going to, uh, unmute everybody here.

487
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Everybody is now alive.

488
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:24,080
If you want to say something, because once again, we're going to try another hit test hit number 154.

489
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,080
You got all the answer if you know it.

490
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
This is the hit test.

491
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Hit it test.

492
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
YUMBOLESS!

493
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,080
So you don't want to hit this number 154.

494
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
And here we go.

495
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,080
We're in drone number one.

496
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Uh, Diana Ross upside down.

497
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Come on, people on the conference.

498
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
You guys can't hear that.

499
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
I mean, it's obvious.

500
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Diana, we're all on.

501
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Are we kidding?

502
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Number two.

503
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

504
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Pots, all young.

505
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
All young, uh, won't you come back, please?

506
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Oh, no.

507
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
I think it's won't you come back.

508
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
All young.

509
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
And this is number three.

510
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,880
Oh, come on, you guys know that one, don't you?

511
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,280
We're the gana?

512
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,680
No, Madonna.

513
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,480
No way, it's the power station, some like at heart.

514
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
It's Madonna.

515
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,280
Oh, it's time for the answers.

516
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,880
All right, everybody's sing along now.

517
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,680
And this is answer number one.

518
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
I tell you, me and you.

519
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I said stop to me.

520
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,080
Oh, sorry, misqueer.

521
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Oh, they don't that I need.

522
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Oh, sorry, down.

523
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Boy, you turned me inside out.

524
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
And round around.

525
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I'm sorry, down, you turn me.

526
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
You're fine, you're fine.

527
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Oh, I'm instinctively.

528
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Round and round, you turn me.

529
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,080
I say to be respectfully.

530
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm sorry.

531
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,080
And you're number one, Diana Ross upside down.

532
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,080
And this is answer number two.

533
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
Three, two, three.

534
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,080
So there we go.

535
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,080
You said you'd be mine till the end of time.

536
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,080
Who don't wait in a longer?

537
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,080
Why don't you come back?

538
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
Please hurry.

539
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,080
Welcome back, can't stay.

540
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Oh, good this time.

541
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,080
Did you come back here?

542
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Stay, oh, good.

543
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,080
Answer number two, fall young, come back and stay.

544
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
And this is answer number three.

545
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,080
Can't believe who is tough for you guys, just easy.

546
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,080
I think we're gonna do the work.

547
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:42,080
We'll be the best.

548
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
We'll be the best.

549
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
We'll be the best.

550
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,080
We'll be the best.

551
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
We'll be the best.

552
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
We'll be the best.

553
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
We'll be the best.

554
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
We'll be the best.

555
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
We'll be the best.

556
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Huh?

557
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Some like it.

558
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:04,080
Answer number three.

559
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,080
The power station.

560
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,080
And that concludes hit us number 154.

561
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,080
So Adam, how did you do this week?

562
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I did pretty well.

563
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I did six out of six.

564
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Folks on the call, socked.

565
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,080
I'll get better over time.

566
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,080
Maybe it was really hard to hear.

567
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
I don't know.

568
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,080
Appreciate it though.

569
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Two and one day.

570
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
The answers to this and any other hits as well.

571
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,080
So the links to iTunes, you can buy the turks.

572
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Featured on the hittest online.

573
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,080
To be founded hittest.mefio.com.

574
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Thanks for playing Adam.

575
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
No, thank you young.

576
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Everyone else.

577
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Thanks for listening again.

578
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Next week, I hope to be back for another hittest.

579
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
So until then, have fun.

580
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
Take care.

581
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
And remember, try to think with your hearts.

582
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Bye-bye.

583
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,080
We back hittest.mefio.com.

584
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,080
In hope young.com.

585
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,080
JNPOLT.com.

586
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,080
My natural rescue bill fails in Congress yet again.

587
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
The value of your home could plummet.

588
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,080
Families looking for a new home will be unable to get alone.

589
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,080
It's going to be harder for you to get a mortgage for your home.

590
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
New car sales will come to a halt.

591
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Or the loans you need to buy a car.

592
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,080
It would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need to buy a car.

593
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Or send your children to car.

594
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
No longer be able to get loans for college.

595
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,080
My businesses would close their doors.

596
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
And they'd be unable to pay employees.

597
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,080
Thousands of businesses could call.

598
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
In millions of Americans could lose their jobs.

599
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
Millions of jobs could be lost.

600
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,080
We failed to act.

601
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,080
Ultimately, our country could experience a long and painful recession.

602
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,080
There you go.

603
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,080
That's the proof that they're all reading from the same script.

604
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,080
Many more examples like it because that's exactly how it works.

605
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:48,080
Lady Patricia started to catch on to some of this as well, which is kind of cool.

606
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,080
She's more often than not.

607
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,080
She's saying, hey, you know, there's something really weird going on there.

608
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:01,080
She's starting to figure out that maybe there is something behind this shadow, shadow

609
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,080
government that is controlling everyone like puppets on strings.

610
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
Really good article.

611
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
I'd like you to check out.

612
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,080
I will drop this into the show notes a daily source code.com across post that on curry.com.

613
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Written by David Burn, of course, of the talking heads.

614
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,080
He wrote this on December 18th.

615
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
I'm not going to read the entire thing to you.

616
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:27,080
But it's kind of the topic we've been on today about the news and how mainstream news is reporting

617
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,080
certainly the events in Gaza and Israel in a certain way.

618
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Good battery different.

619
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,080
It's certainly not the whole story.

620
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:43,080
It really does, it pisses me off that you're not seeing any footage of these protests and the shoe throwing.

621
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,080
What a great meme.

622
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Wow, that's something I believe the whole world can get behind regardless of religion.

623
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,080
The message is very clear.

624
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,080
It's a great one.

625
00:47:52,080 --> 00:48:00,080
And when you see Nike shoes and Adidas, you know, not sandals, but, you know, boots, you know,

626
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,080
get out there.

627
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,080
Throw you a monoloblanix.

628
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,080
So David Burn at the talking heads wrote this blog post on his,

629
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,080
David Burn dot com journal dot David Burn dot com.

630
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
No more news is the title of it.

631
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,080
And he basically goes, he starts right off with media ownership,

632
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:19,080
the tribune company owns the Chicago Tribune, the Baltimore Sun, Los Angeles Times,

633
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,080
Cubs, bunch of TV stations, blah, blah, blah, blah.

634
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,080
And he goes through exactly how mergers acquisitions work,

635
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,080
what happens.

636
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,080
He's own experiences when Warner Brothers was purchased by AOL.

637
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:38,080
What that means for, you know, when a, when a, certainly media companies go from being a,

638
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,080
a business running cash flow positive or profitable to huge expansion and debt and,

639
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,080
and what takes place.

640
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,080
And essentially that, you know, the mainstream news outlets just aren't,

641
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,080
they, they, it's no longer in their DNA to do investigative reporting.

642
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,080
It just is not read through it to get his take on it.

643
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,080
It was, yeah, I was pleasantly surprised by, by what he wrote.

644
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:08,080
And good to see some of the musicians from the old school getting back into the game.

645
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:13,080
Chrissy, kind of the pretenders, the pretenders have an album out and there's a new song

646
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,080
and a video to go along with it.

647
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,080
She's always been kind of a rebel.

648
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,080
And I'm getting, I'm getting permission to play the MP3 and they have some tickets.

649
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Apparently the, the record company is really,

650
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,080
someone over at the record company loves the show.

651
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,080
And has said, look, we'll, we'll get your permission to play the song.

652
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,080
You can play the clip, whatever you want to do.

653
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,080
And they're going to get me some tickets to give away to, to the chuckleheads.

654
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,080
Hey, everybody, we're going to give away some tickets.

655
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,080
Ah!

656
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Let's see.

657
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,080
I got one more savant who, uh, sent in a, a call.

658
00:49:48,080 --> 00:50:00,080
Hey, yeah, Adam, it's a prolific program I hear from San Francisco.

659
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:07,080
First off, there, we, um, the CSB and I always respond to your DSC with an answer show.

660
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:14,080
Usually every weekend, most of the time, um, sometimes not because we do get lazy.

661
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,080
Um, about the Irish rejection, I used to live in Ireland.

662
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,080
Oh, I didn't know that.

663
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,080
British, but I do, I was, I was living in Ireland, like I said before.

664
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,080
Excellent. This, uh, all of a sudden, prolific programer has expanded as universe.

665
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,080
All right.

666
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,080
So lay in on me. This, of course, is about the Lisbon Treaty, uh, which I read through again.

667
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,080
Someone sent me a, or dropped, uh, a consolidated version.

668
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,080
I was looking through it again, laughing at all of the,

669
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:48,080
legalese and references and language that essentially sets them up for exactly what the plan was for this new economic world order as they're calling it.

670
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Um, allowing this to take place.

671
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:57,080
And then, you know, in hindsight, you go back and now you see what's happened with the economy and the financial system in general.

672
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
And now you see this, this Lisbon Treaty makes so much sense.

673
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:05,080
And why it had to be done in October because they knew that it was going to come crashing down at the end of the year.

674
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:10,080
So they could take swift action. And now, of course, they're acting under what they call the Lisbon principles,

675
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,080
which is basically, as if the Lisbon Treaty have been ratified, but there's still two countries,

676
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,080
Czech Republic has not ratified it in Ireland, even, they have not ratified it.

677
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:25,080
They have declined it thrown it out by, uh, way of a referendum.

678
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,080
And, uh, that, of course, is not acceptable.

679
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:37,080
So the, uh, the true global elitist who owned the world will just force Ireland to have a second referendum.

680
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,080
Hell yeah, until the end of the third one until they get it.

681
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Yes.

682
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:49,080
And it seems to me that the new church, the way they call it, by Mr. Brian Cowell, is not as convincing as Bertie.

683
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:54,080
I heard was, given that Cowell is not as popular as I heard.

684
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,080
And the economy there in Ireland is narrowing the toilets.

685
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,080
Yeah, they're going to, that's, that's what you're saying is now they're going to vote. Yes.

686
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,080
The point of Lisbon was the final nail in the coffin.

687
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:11,080
See, the, the boats in Ireland are not 100% for against referendum.

688
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,080
They're more like 55 or 50%.

689
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
It's like, that was a little bit more than that.

690
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,080
Okay. First of all, it was a high turnout, and it was more than 55%.

691
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:29,080
And the state, um, therefore any little, and by the way, 55% in the United States election,

692
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,080
it would be considered a landslide.

693
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,080
A little, a few votes can tip it with me or the other.

694
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,080
Anyway, happy Christmas, all the best.

695
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:45,080
And I look forward to you, plugging the D.S.E.D. bug at D.S.E.D. bug.mevio.com.

696
00:52:45,080 --> 00:53:15,080
That's D.S.E.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D

697
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:45,080
D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D

698
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,520
It's fun to have some real-time feedback in the form of a chat room.

699
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:54,920
You can do that in the talk show, web page or client, however you want to do that.

700
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:01,600
It keeps me kind of awake and on my toes, and once I get my production schedule kind

701
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,040
of in check, I believe I can get back to a pretty much daily schedule.

702
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,840
Now it may only be 40 minutes, which I think many people might find desirable.

703
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,920
All we might go long or short, I don't know, but I'm slowly garnering control over

704
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,560
my schedule.

705
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,160
This week and actually it's when I make the big flip, I've got to produce a double time

706
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,480
so I can be one day ahead, currently I produce on the day of, and then I'll be much

707
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,440
more flexible, but still, it looks like I'm going to have to shoot for late in the afternoon

708
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,880
slash early evening, UK time in order to get as many people on the phone as possible,

709
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,600
to get enough interaction just to get the West Coast in.

710
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,080
It's really tough though, I think we're going to have to figure out maybe coffee break lunch

711
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:53,320
time with that work, which would pretty much be my exclusive UK folks, I don't know.

712
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,320
I don't know.

713
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
We'll figure it out.

714
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,240
Anyway, play one last time for you.

715
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,800
It's also came from the drop.

716
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,320
Unfortunately, no information in the comments.

717
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,320
It's titled The Future soon.

718
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:17,840
It's said I love you, signed an anonymous friend, turns out she's smarter than I thought

719
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,280
she was.

720
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:27,200
She knows I wrote it now, the whole class does too, and I am all alone during double

721
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,560
skate.

722
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:37,200
When she skits ball, it's in God and on, but I know that I'll forget the look of pity

723
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,200
in her face.

724
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:44,880
When I'm running in my soul, I don't want a platform in space, because God made a future

725
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
soon.

726
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,200
I won't always be in this place, but the things that make me weak and strange can't

727
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,200
end in a way.

728
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:59,920
It's going to be a future soon, never seen a quite so clear, when my heart is breaking

729
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:13,040
I can close my eyes, it's already here.

730
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:22,680
I'll probably be some kind of scientist, building inventions in my space, laughing space.

731
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,600
I'll end world hunger, I'll make dolphins speak.

732
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:35,240
Work through the daytime, spend my nights, and we can't perfecting my warrior, you know my

733
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,240
grace.

734
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:44,280
Newling them well as you got out of time, I'd love to my best to teach them about life

735
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
and what it's worth.

736
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:53,440
I just know that I can't keep them from destroying me, but we've got a future soon, I won't

737
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
always be in this way.

738
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,760
When the things that make me weak and strange can't end in a way.

739
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:07,240
It's going to be a future soon, never seen a quite so clear, when my heart is breaking

740
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:16,880
I can close my eyes, it's already here, I'll end world hunger, as I piece by piece,

741
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:29,040
it's the place by self, and the skill and circus will make me home, but I still feel so long

742
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:35,840
until Laura calls me home.

743
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:46,080
I'll see her standing by the moderate, she'll look the same except for Bionic Eye, she lost

744
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:55,880
the real ones in the robot world, I'll say I'm sorry, she'll say it's not your fault or

745
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:05,880
isn't she'll eye me suspiciously, we're in the world of the servers inside, she'll scream

746
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,520
and try to rock it, but there's no way she can't hide it, when crazy side of all

747
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:19,600
wants to make you his robot life, when it's going to be a future soon, I won't always be in this way.

748
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:27,520
When the things that make me weak and strange can't end in a way, it's going to be a future soon, never seen a

749
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:40,960
quite so clear, when my heart is breaking I can close my eyes, it's already here, now I'm kind of a happy song,

750
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:48,880
in a way, that wraps it up for daily source code episode 814 coming to you semi live from the

curry terrace in Southwest London, the eastern part of Gitmonation, I'll try and do it again with you tomorrow,

756
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,000
I saw on the chat room there, Woody, you just got let go or made redundant as they say here in the UK.

757
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:37,440
Yeah, I was relieved, not about a server. Relieved from your services or released.

758
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:48,400
Yeah, I was a lot more concerned about that, so hopefully 2009 we'll get better for you. Jamie, thank
