the grease minus zero so it's freezing in Holland and we got a lot of water you know

1183
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,320
we're the lower territory so we got a lot to do here man it's really warm the

1184
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,880
foot to see everyone's planting on the ice so I'm going to skate today and

1185
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,880
what I say thanks for everyone who comment on the DSE Overview 2008 it was really

1186
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,080
a pleasure for me to create a stop you know it's like a painting or something

1187
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,680
it was kind of sucked into the project but I really love it thanks and talk to

1188
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,120
you later this year but happy new year you know how to go now Ray thanks again man

1189
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,160
it was a fantastic overview I know exactly what you're talking about with

1190
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,120
it being almost like a painting I feel like my shows are that every single day

1191
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,040
and the mevio today show I put together actually put together like a painting like

1192
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,760
paint by the numbers no less B.C. Smith apparently is in California let's see

1193
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,440
if we can get them on the phone hey I don't know the gun hey is this B.C. stands for a

1194
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,000
watt bulb actually it's been this is actually been from Oakland your old time

1195
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,560
economics advanced hey Ben how you doing man good to talk to you that's a bad

1196
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,120
yourself yeah I hang it in there so what's what's the situation like in Oakland

1197
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,520
right now well for what I could tell it was interesting because you know I live in

1198
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,840
Oakland and just kind of watching you know last time I'm going to sleep for probably

1199
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,920
about three or four helicopters flying over downtown and didn't really know what

1200
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,560
we're going on then but you know this morning you wake up here is a news report

1201
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,840
and from what you know we've seen locally here there are about 200 people but

1202
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,600
started off at a rally at the barge station where they got a shot just kind of a

1203
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
peaceful you know gathering there in the afternoon kind of a memorial that

1204
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,040
same and then from there kind of a group broke off and started walking you know

1205
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,680
feel like they're marching downtown in Moscow the mob mentality I think

1206
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,280
took over right and just let you like you were saying I mean you know one person

1207
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,400
throws a brick for a window in there and so it's chaos they tried flipping a few

1208
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,880
cop cars over broke a bunch of car windows that some cars on fire the cops

1209
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,840
and right gear showed up and then your guests are flying right you know what

1210
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,880
happened you know kind of one of those things where you get that work yeah they

1211
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,120
should be marching and they should be saying that you shouldn't be

1212
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,960
doing this on station turning brick through windows of random

1213
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,920
shots downtown but you know they're pissed off yeah now they should be

1214
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,840
some very very pissed off he was speaking of tear gas I was reading that the

1215
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,280
cops in in Athens were with the writing has been going on for for weeks now

1216
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,680
that they actually ran out of tear gas and they bought more from Israel of

1217
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,840
course well Israel doesn't need tear gas they have thanks yeah but but they

1218
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:47,840
got tear gas apparently and they're selling a cheap bunny bait so Ben is there

1219
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,280
any media coverage it sounds like like it's 200 people well although I

1220
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,760
wouldn't like to see an angry mob of 200 people it's certainly not thousands

1221
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,280
is there any coverage of this is is mainstream picking it up or not you're

1222
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,440
definitely seeing you like the San Francisco I call out a store in the front page

1223
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,120
this morning right yeah that's the one that I read last night so that was there

1224
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,240
I mean that's you know if that's mainstream I'm sure the network news stations

1225
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
probably had stories this morning I don't want the network news because it's

1226
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,000
usually pointless so you can't comment on that I mean you're seeing stuff I mean

1227
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,720
it's definitely if you go to the Chronicles website today it's the lead story

1228
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,400
there they've got a lot of pictures I think for people there last night taking

1229
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,920
pictures in the Chronicle to their credit as a pretty good job of letting the

1230
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,800
public submit pictures to them yeah the publish on their website so there's a

1231
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,160
lot of good pictures I think it's probably the best one they have on there is

1232
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,840
a car burning in the background with the cops and right here in front of it right

1233
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,640
it's kind of those ominous shots well I would say and I would plead to to all

1234
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,480
chuckle heads that you know the the best thing you can do to help the

1235
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,120
situation is whenever you see a good article and I agree I thought the

1236
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,560
thought the Chronicle article was at least it seemed detailed and I presume

1237
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,520
accurate is send that to people you know it's just show it around because it's

1238
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,280
the reason that people really don't know this stuff is you know I have to see

1239
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,080
something three times before it sinks in I've learned this because my wife

1240
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,920
for 22 freaking years repeats everything three times to make sure that I have

1241
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,960
heard her and understand it and she's right of course usually I want to say oh yeah

1242
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,160
I got it okay and if you don't see news about something at least three

1243
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,560
time is not going to sink in it's like this morning I picked up the the financial

1244
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,440
times was sold out I got to talk to my guys and my new news agents the headline

1245
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,400
looking for it is something that I I told Patricia just the other day I said you

1246
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
know what these guys are doing I'm going to do what these bastards are going to

1247
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,480
do is the same thing they've done in the States is they're going to want to

1248
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,880
protect themselves for deflation because you know you can't make any money when

1249
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,000
there's no interest on on loans oh I can't I find the fun of the paper so I

1250
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,280
said they're going to start to inflate stuff and it says right on the crap I can't

1251
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,080
haha I know what it said I just wanted to make sure I read it exactly right

1252
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,560
it says treasury to print more money to to beat inflation that's essentially it

1253
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,040
as that's what Alistair Darling said oh we got to create some more money to come back

1254
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,080
more money in inflation it doesn't necessarily inflation no no they want to increase

1255
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:42,520
inflation okay so that's like it's delusion of our money so I mean that that is

1256
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,200
Ron Paul said and I think he said it correctly it's it's immoral as like saying here's

1257
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,720
this milk we have but you know what we're going to dilute it a little bit by adding more water

1258
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:00,840
to it it's it's immoral and it messes up a lot of stuff so you know when you start to

1259
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,520
print money your money devalues inflation rises and prices go up your wages won't

1260
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,320
necessarily go up immediately that's when the real ride is going to happen because

1261
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,920
people will want more will need more money to get by so the interesting because I think

1262
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,520
what you're going to see this year is they're going to a lot of companies are going to

1263
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,560
give me this to their employees because of poor economic times but inflation's going to happen

1264
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,000
and it's going to take a while for people to kind of catch up to that and that's that's where

1265
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,040
it all goes horribly wrong I'm still looking up here it is finally got the front of the paper

1266
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Chancellor set to print more cash as rates hit record low and I should have underline this I should

1267
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:56,600
have kept this but essentially as interest rates appear certain to fall to an historic low today

1268
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,520
interest rates essentially sure you know you're getting screwed as if you're saving money because

1269
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,840
you're getting very little interest but more interestingly guys who lend money aren't going to

1270
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,720
get a lot of interest either so the chancellor and that's Alice Darling and Merven King I'm

1271
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,960
talking about the UK obviously the governor of the Bank of England the central bank of England the

1272
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,160
Federal Reserve of England are looking at expanding the money supply by billions and using the

1273
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,600
extra cash to buy assets ranging from government or commercial debt to private equities exactly the

1274
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:36,280
same thing that the tarp program was all about big bailout big printing of money the people get

1275
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,280
screwed or people who are pretty much in the lower middle class I'm sorry I'm sorry I know you

1276
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,560
would you well well the said doing all the time the banks are doing I think they need to do

1277
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,160
the second act they're going to need the pump money to the economy people they all need to do

1278
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,720
isn't a year's time to take all that extra money back out and the hard thing is the set has a

1279
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,600
really hard time taking me out of the system very easy to put money into this everyone's good

1280
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,040
right so it's your money slot and around and if it was only a temporary thing

1281
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,000
It would actually benefit, but the problem is that the Fed hadn't taken money out of the

1282
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,640
system until the early 80s when inflation was so bad and Volcker came in and did all that,

1283
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,920
but it stopped for about two years while he was doing that. But it was great. It's 60

1284
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,320
economy. It did what it was supposed to do and it was a good thing. Probably I don't think

1285
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,320
that's going to do that this time. And here's going to have this math inflation. I think those

1286
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,760
unfortunately could sweep into the system. Well, the countdown has begun. We'll keep our eye on it.

1287
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,760
Down there. Ben, thanks for calling me, man. I appreciate it.

1288
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Hey, that's a lot, thank you. Bye bye.

1289
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Oh, lot, they're don'ts. While robbers laugh and steal.

1290
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,760
They're going to watch them eat their meals.

1291
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Oh, lot, they're gonna eat their meals.

1292
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Rock on glass is everywhere. It's a bloody scene.

1293
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Can't make the citizens as they own the news.

1294
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Children play with mustard cards.

1295
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Those cover their hands.

1296
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Palaces are laughing and drink.

1297
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Drunk to all their memories.

1298
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Family's buying dog food now. Starvation runs the street.

1299
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:08,760
They've decided before the one infected by the green.

1300
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Now some folks say that we should be blessed.

1301
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:24,760
For what we have, tell me what you'd be happy.

1302
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Oh, man, be incomparable in the bowl.

1303
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,760
The music a genius at our steve wonder.

1304
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,760
And village ghetto land from songs in the key of life.

1305
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
I love that song.

1306
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,760
And I love the way it sounds on the new set of everything sounds.

1307
00:32:50,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Let me see, this is a pretty big story over here in Europe.

1308
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,760
That Russia has effectively turned off the gas supply running to the Ukraine.

1309
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,760
This seems to happen just about every single winter.

1310
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
This, of course, there's a lot of history between Russia and the Ukraine.

1311
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:25,760
And this really, I would have to say, is pretty much a business deal gone bad from what I understand.

1312
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:34,760
And what I've been able to gather, 640 million, I believe it's dollars is owed by the Ukraine to Russia.

1313
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,760
And Russia said, hey, man, if you're not going to pay up, we're going to turn off the supply, which, of course, is obviously,

1314
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,760
is not Russia, is Gazprom, but let's just say it effectively, that's Putin, Ergo Russia.

1315
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:54,760
We're just going to turn off. If you don't want to pay, now, the slight problem is that the gas that flows through the Ukraine also

1316
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:02,760
supplies, I believe, about a third, if not somewhat more of all the natural gas to Europe,

1317
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
including many Western Europe countries.

1318
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,760
So I'm looking at this map here.

1319
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Everything from Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, like Greece needed this shit.

1320
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, Italy, Germany, France, all of them

1321
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,760
affected from badly to severely due to the shortage coming through the Ukraine.

1322
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Now, if it weren't for the fact that this is one of the coldest winters we've witnessed in many, many years.

1323
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,760
You heard Ray call in. In fact, a guy I know in Holland, he was kind of a whacked out Tony Robbins,

1324
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,760
type guy, celebrity, NLP, dude. He gets an unfair rap, his name is Emiel Dattelbaum.

1325
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,760
I like the guy very much, he's very smart, but he messes up his public,

1326
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,760
he messes up his public stuff and people think he's a, you know, basically he took it one step too far,

1327
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,760
and it's hard to erase that image from people. He's a very, very smart guy. He called me up.

1328
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,760
He said, dude, let's do the 11 city skating competition, which hasn't taken place in

1329
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,760
God knows how many decades, which is a huge thing in Holland.

1330
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,760
All the canals for his over, it's a natural ice and you skate through 11 different cities.

1331
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,760
And I don't know, it's hundreds of kilometers long and, you know, people died doing it.

1332
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:34,760
But it hasn't happened so long because of course, well, that's a global warming and climate change has brought all this upon us.

1333
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,760
And well, now we have people who are going to freeze to death in their homes.

1334
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,760
And if you don't think it happens, pay attention, pay attention to the news and spread it around and try and help people out.

1335
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:52,760
And, um, where was that I was reading about this? It was, um, I believe in Rome.

1336
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Maybe it wasn't, I think it must have been either Romania or Bulgaria of the schools are closed.

1337
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,760
And they're chopping up wood to heat the children.

1338
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,760
So, uh, there's a lot of crazy things going on.

1339
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Let me see what else is in the news, uh, interesting.

1340
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,760
And of course, all of these links in the show notes, a daily source code dot com crossposts that are curry dot com.

1341
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Uh, Reuters article.

1342
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
I love this.

1343
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Uh, John Taylor, who was the undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs from 2001 to 2005, said the explosive growth of the feds balance sheet.

1344
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,760
That's, uh, the money that, uh, we have effectively lent out the bankers and given away in some cases.

1345
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Since September, this balance sheet, according to John Taylor, has been, quote, unbelievable.

1346
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:54,760
He goes on to say, this doesn't really seem like quantitative easing in the sense of finding a growth rate in the money supply told a panel discussion.

1347
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:00,760
At the American Economic Association, what you're looking at now is really being determined by other considerations.

1348
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
How much should we buy of mortgage back securities?

1349
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
How much should we loan to foreign central banks?

1350
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,760
This is really more like an industrial policy. Read this article.

1351
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
It's from Reuters. It's mainstream.

1352
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,760
And it really does, uh, give you some insights into how some people are thinking about what's going on.

1353
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
I'll just turn on CNBC.

1354
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Man, there are a lot of people freaking out about about what's going on.

1355
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Uh, I'll just run through this list and stop anything that, uh, that hits our fancy.

1356
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:38,760
This is, uh, New Zealand is now picking up on the Gardasil, uh, profit freight train.

1357
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,760
They now want to offer this, uh, or they're, it's being made available free to girls age 12 to 18 in New Zealand.

1358
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:56,760
It's free, maybe, to those, the victims who are taking it.

1359
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,760
It's being paid for by your tax, uh, tax money.

1360
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,760
At the bottom of the article, thank God, at least it's in there.

1361
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Family first national director, Bob McCowskree said,

1362
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
The vaccination is unproven.

1363
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Yes. I think we've, uh, safely established that.

1364
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,760
And I'm not against, uh, vaccinations. I'm not again. You know, there's, we,

1365
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Look, I'm sure that I'm very happy I got my polio and, uh,

1366
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,760
What other, what other, um, vaccinations I've received as a child.

1367
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,760
But when it comes to the amount that kids are being inoculated with these days.

1368
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Like 36 different, in these cocktail, 36 different versions.

1369
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,760
And there are traces of mercury. And there is all kinds of bad shit in there.

1370
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,760
And it's hurting our kids, but this stuff, this HPV.

1371
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Human, papal, mal, what is it? Papal, mal virus.

1372
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Papal mal virus.

1373
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Which is supposed to prevent cervical cancer is indeed unproven, even by scientific methods.

1374
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,760
We've had doctors on this show explain that to us.

1375
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Um, this was kind of fun, particularly because it came from a daily tech.com,

1376
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,760
which I read from time to time, uh, more for tech than for anything else that you can imagine.

1377
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,760
Headlines, sea ice ends the year at the same level as 1979.

1378
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I'm sure you will be reading about this.

1379
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Make sure people see it because it's important to know that this is data being reported by the

1380
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,760
University of Illinois's Arctic Climate Research Center.

1381
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:34,760
And it's derived from satellite observations of the northern and southern hemisphere polar regions.

1382
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:44,760
And right now, uh, according to them, the sea ice this year or 2008 ended at the same level as in 1979.

1383
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,760
And they, they go on to say that, you know, this stuff does, uh, thaw and freeze quite a bit.

1384
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,760
It's not like the, uh, like the permafrost, permafrost.

1385
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Um, but in May, and this is the point that I think is important,

1386
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:06,760
concerns over disappearing sea ice lead to the United States officially listing their polar bear as a threatened species.

1387
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Even over objections from experts who claim the animals numbers were actually increasing.

1388
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,760
So, uh, someone's full of shit somewhere.

1389
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
That's for sure.

1390
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,760
This is a really cool one, uh, from CES, of course, to the consumer electronics show taking place in Vegas.

1391
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
So, be great if someone was out there.

1392
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:34,760
And, uh, I could call in if you were in Vegas, uh, because I'd love to see this device for real.

1393
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Blau-punked.

1394
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,760
And company called me rumor, I think is how you pronounce it.

1395
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,760
We'll be announcing the first in-internet radio receiver.

1396
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
I love this.

1397
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,760
So you get streaming radio stations.

1398
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Um, here's actually, well, this is a very, it's, this is from autoblog.com link in the show notes.

1399
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Uh, a lot of a lot of information about it, but users of the new head units will be able to tune into

1400
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Internet radio stations offered by me, rumor, okay?

1401
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,760
As well as add stations of their choosing by simply inputting the URL.

1402
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:14,760
So I'm hoping that they have some form of, um, RSS parsing mechanism in this software as well,

1403
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,760
because I'm, you know, pretty much like you listen to a podcast that has been pre-recorded.

1404
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Um, as long as you can access the MP3 file and you can, you know, you can play it progressively as it downloads,

1405
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,760
kind of a version of streaming works perfectly over, uh, GPRS and, uh, and, and, uh, 3G.

1406
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
That would be very awesome.

1407
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Oh, man.

1408
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
What I'd buy, I'd buy them for every single cut.

1409
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
Well, actually, I get rid of my cars.

1410
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Hey, if anyone wants to buy a car, by the way, I'm getting rid of a couple in the UK,

1411
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
cheap.

1412
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm getting rid of the jag and I'm getting rid of the, uh, the smart roadster,

1413
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
but we don't need a car anymore.

1414
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,760
I want to keep one car, Christina's, um,

1415
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,760
but, uh, the others that they gotta go.

1416
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
It's just, it's cost me like 120 pounds just to keep them near the house.

1417
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Who needs to get rid of these cars?

1418
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
I'm going green, baby.

1419
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Alright, let's, uh, play another song.

1420
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,760
If you got anything, talk about throw it up on, uh, talk to you.

1421
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Chat room.

1422
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Stand up for your right.

1423
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Or Twitter me.

1424
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Stand up.

1425
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,760
Stand up for your right.

1426
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Stand up.

1427
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Stand up.

1428
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Stand up.

1429
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Stand up for your right.

1430
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Stand up.

1431
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Stand up.

1432
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Don't give up the fight.

1433
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,760
Pretty.

1434
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Come and don't tell me.

1435
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Heaven is on the gear.

1436
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,760
I know you don't know, what life is really worth.

1437
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Here's a call that needs a reward.

1438
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,760
I've just told you I've never been told.

1439
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,760
So now you see the right thing.

1440
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Stand up for your right.

1441
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Come on, get up, set up.

1442
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Stand up for your right.

1443
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Get up, set up.

1444
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Don't give up the fight.

1445
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,760
Get up, set up.

1446
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,760

1447
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,760
Get up, set up.

1448
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,760
Don't give up the fight.

1449
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Most people think,

1450
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Break our little come from the sky.

1451
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Take away everything,

1452
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,760
And make a heavy body feel high.

1453
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,760
With this and all, with life is worth.

1454
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
You will look for yours on earth.

1455
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
And now will you see the right.

1456
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Just stand up for your right.

1457
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
Get up, set up.

1458
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Stand up, set up.

00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,760

Get up, set up.

1463
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Don't give up the fight.

1464
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Get up, set up.

1465
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760

Get up, set up.

1533
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,560
Let's see, we've got you for Bob.

1534
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
Yeah, I'm Norea.

1535
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,560
Good man, what's your name? Bob?

1536
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Yeah, Bob's young and little dad boy.

1537
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Hey, Bob.

1538
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,560
So I saw you chatting away there about about the sea ice,

1539
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,560
which apparently is not melting away.

1540
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
Yeah, that was a good story.

1541
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
I don't have to do a Google on that.

1542
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,560
That was a catch by your dad dialing for that.

1543
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Because, you know, I've been following your most, you know,

1544
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
your recent DSAs.

1545
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
They're nearly on the trail of, you know,

1546
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,560
the BS story about the climate change.

1547
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,560
You know, we're used to be called global warming.

1548
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Definitely got, you got also that pretty straight.

1549
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,560
Yeah, it's, uh, it's pretty amazing, you know,

1550
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,560
there's so much evidence coming out about, uh,

1551
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,560
about global warming at this very moment.

1552
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,560
And, you know, by the way, just look around you.

1553
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Look, and, you know, what is the perfect temperature for the world?

1554
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,560
I know that it's kind of cold here.

1555
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,560
And I wouldn't mind it being a little bit warmer.

1556
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,560
But, you know, it's, it's so amazing when you talk to people about this.

1557
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,560
There is an immediate, whoa, you're crazy, man.

1558
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
We're, we're burning up the world.

1559
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
We're, we're killing ourselves.

1560
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
We've got to change.

1561
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,560
Like, yeah, obviously we've always got to be careful with our planet.

1562
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,560
But I take huge offense at the, at all the laws and restrictions that are being placed.

1563
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,560
And as far as I can tell, monetary system that's going to be put in place based upon

1564
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,560
what I can see is nothing but a farce.

1565
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,560
It just doesn't add up, you know, all the charts and all the beautiful power point presentations

1566
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,560
and the movies and the Oscars and the Grammys and the Nobel Prize.

1567
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,560
Still makes it very cold here.

1568
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
Yeah.

1569
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1570
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,560
They see the same sort of spinning planet by our old friend out there.

1571
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,560
And that's great.

1572
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,560
It's kind of scary.

1573
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:35,560
It's kind of a potential at least, you know, in very kind of like we're potential for this carbon-based

1574
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,560
monetary policy.

1575
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,560
You know, I'm not, I mean, in any position to get influence anything.

1576
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,560
I like to use hope to hope that does.

1577
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Well, well, Bob, that's where I disagree.

1578
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,560
I think we're all in a position to do something about it.

1579
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,560
And all it takes is that look, you're forwarding stupid YouTube clips to your buddies all day

1580
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,560
long anyway.

1581
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,560
We're twittering all over the place.

1582
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,560
We're doing blog posts.

1583
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,560
You know, if you see something like this, but you don't,

1584
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,560
it does not have to be a nian, a nian, a nian, a nian, which I do enough of.

1585
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
But just, just send it along.

1586
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
Hey, look at this.

1587
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
That's kind of interesting.

1588
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,560
Didn't know that.

1589
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,560
Everyone sent around all the word dying emails and power points and links and webpages

1590
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
and graphs and charts.

1591
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,560
So, you know, it's, and if it's, and this is what I like about mainstream reporting

1592
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,560
because there is a lot of good reporting being done.

1593
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,560
It's out there.

1594
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
All you have to do is catch it.

1595
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,560
And you've got to share it amongst people.

1596
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,560
So I think everyone can do something, just help educate your fellow man.

1597
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,560
If they see something three times, it'll start to dawn on him.

1598
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
That's really all that it takes.

1599
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,560
Yes, good thing.

1600
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
All right, Bob, I appreciate you calling him, man.

1601
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,560
It's a very kind of you.

1602
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,560
I just want to hit Philly real quick because he's been hanging on since the

1603
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,560
moment we started the show.

1604
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,560
Yeah.

1605
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,560
Hey, man, who's this?

1606
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
This is Alex.

1607
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
I think it's a little bit.

1608
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
First of all, are you on Skype?

1609
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Sounds like it.

1610
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Now I'm on time.

1611
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,560
I just want to have a time.

1612
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
I'll see if we'll dare.

1613
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
You know, this phone technology.

1614
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,560
We really got to find something better.

1615
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
It's just not cutting it.

1616
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,560
It's like the weakest link in the chain.

1617
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,560
I just want to say, hey, since since you've been hanging on so long,

1618
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
I appreciate you listening and appreciate you hanging in there.

1619
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
Okay.

1620
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,560
All right.

1621
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,560
Let's go down to, well, actually, let's go straight down under to our

1622
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,560
buddy, Claugwag, Tom Scooting, sent me an audio comment.

1623
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
It's Tom.

1624
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,560
Tom speaking from Australia.

1625
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,560
Um.

1626
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,560
All right.

1627
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Let's go down to, well, actually, let's go straight down under to our

1628
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,560
buddy, Claugwag, Tom Scooting sent me an audio comment.

1629
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,560
It's Tom, Tom speaking from Australia.

1630
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Um.

1631
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,560
The first of all, the reason why I called got them cracked off and I thought I

1632
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
have to send you something straight away.

1633
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
I also forget.

1634
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
Um.

1635
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,560
This is the sound.

1636
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,560
Oh, that we's going to do the SLR reflex debunking.

1637
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Excellent Tom.

1638
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,560
But why are you calling from the toilet bowl?

1639
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,560
Of a very cheap digital SLR.

1640
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,560
They all make that sound.

1641
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,560
The more expensive they are, the more notice they make.

1642
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,560
And so let's, yeah, some sort of debunking one of your theories.

1643
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,560
And he's, I've got a few other ones.

1644
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Uh, the FEMA camps all over America.

1645
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,560
There's, uh, there's a good list out there with, um, with geo tagging.

1646
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,560
I had to look at quite a few of them.

1647
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,560
Uh, that, that don't look more like, um,

1648
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,560
storage building, single story storage buildings.

1649
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,560
They don't look like camps to me.

1650
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
Um.

1651
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,560
So I'm going to drop in a whole price.

1652
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
Oops, sorry about that.

1653
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
You know, the, um, those FEMA camps.

1654
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Obviously I've been reading about those.

1655
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
I've seen the YouTube videos.

1656
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,560
I've seen the pictures of, uh, of the so-called plastic coffins.

1657
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,560
Hard for me to say either way.

1658
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Um, I, you know, and I think people look at it and they say,

1659
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,560
I'll only shit.

1660
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
This is for real.

1661
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,560
And, uh, other people look at it and say it doesn't seem like it's real at all.

1662
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,560
Um, I, I go by the official government documentation.

1663
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:00,560
Um, pretty sure that there are indeed FEMA camps that maybe not, you know,

1664
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,560
the hundreds that people apparently have cited, um,

1665
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,560
but they're definitely our camps.

1666
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,560
Uh, no doubt about it.

1667
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,560
There, there, there are, uh, FEMA owned enclosures that could pretty much be used as a camp.

1668
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,560
You don't need much except some bar wire and some huts.

1669
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,560
And I seem to go hand in hand with a lack of volume if the oil prices manipulate it.

1670
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,560
It's the, um, the same volume or,

1671
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Let me, let me tell you, the oil price, it gets manipulated when it's on the tankers.

1672
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
That's when it happens. Okay.

1673
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:34,560
It's the, listen, oil has to flow and it gets loaded onto tankers.

1674
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,560
And that's where the price gets manipulated.

1675
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:43,560
Even more volume, um, got a tiny URL.com forward slash oil price too for, uh,

1676
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,560
for a bit of a graph on that.

1677
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,560
Um, then some of the good news, uh,

1678
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,560
Oh, maybe agrees with something.

1679
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,560
You know, how do, how you said things get less and less, um,

1680
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,560
um, a more and more restrictive, um,

1681
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,560
in a year and a straight year, they've just recently, um,

1682
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:10,560
allowed, uh, Dutch unpasteurized, um, milk cheese, um,

1683
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,560
to come in, so it's not all bad.

1684
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,560
And, uh, a link, um, that you might be interested in,

1685
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,560
it's called What's Up With That with WAA,

1686
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,560
WTS UpWithThat.com.

1687
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,560
This guy has, uh, got a warming debunker.

1688
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
Uh-huh.

1689
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,560
Um, yeah, that was it, mate.

1690
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
Sorry, dude.

1691
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,560
Let's just, just get into me.

1692
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,560
There's too much conspiracy theory stuff going on.

1693
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Yeah.

1694
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,560
It's not all that bad.

1695
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
All right.

1696
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
Well, I don't know, man.

1697
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Uh, you're down there in Australia, where they're, uh,

1698
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,560
shutting off your internet.

1699
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,560
So, uh, I don't know what's bad in your book,

1700
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,560
but I think that's pretty bad.

1701
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,560
I love the fact that, um, I put this in that mevio today.

1702
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Um,

1703
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,560
uh, who is it, uh, Larry Flint and Jo, uh,

1704
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,560
what's his name?

1705
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Not Jo, not Jo Fraser, obviously.

1706
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,560
Jo Francis.

1707
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,560
They, uh, they say, oh, we're going to go, uh, to the, to the,

1708
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,560
to the Congress and, uh,

1709
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,560
we want $5 billion for a bailout of the adult entertainment industry.

1710
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,560
Ha ha ha.

1711
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,560
Those guys are funny.

1712
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,560
I do appreciate a good joke.

1713
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,560
Although I know they're pretty damn serious.

1714
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
I don't think they're kidding about it.

1715
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,560
It is.

1716
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,560
It's in, it's in huge trouble.

1717
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,560
Mainly because people copy stuff,

1718
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,560
although I pay for my porn and I'm quite proud of it.

1719
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,560
And in fact, they got an email from Bobby Eden.

1720
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Who turns out is a pretty well-known porn star, actually.

1721
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,560
This is the, um, the girl, the young woman that Patricia flew on, uh,

1722
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,560
the place she was on the same flight from, uh, Amsterdam to London.

1723
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,560
And they got the chatten and she was going over to do some, uh,

1724
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,560
productions in her adult film industry job.

1725
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,560
And, uh, we've kind of kept in touch.

1726
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,560
And, uh, she sent me an email this morning and said, hey, man,

1727
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,560
uh, we're, we're looking at ways to, to make money.

1728
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,560
And it's, uh, you know, times are hard and it's podcasting anything.

1729
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,560
And I can just see Bobby Eden doing a pitch for Go Daddy.

1730
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,560
Ha ha ha.

1731
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,560
I bet you they'd be into it, too.

1732
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,560
That one actually could happen.

1733
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,560
But I got to, I got to figure out.

1734
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,560
I'm gonna take a meeting with her, her, her people regardless.

1735
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,560
Because that's just gonna be fun.

1736
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Oh, by the way, oh, man.

1737
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,560
This, this will trip you out.

1738
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,560
I got to get this from the other side.

1739
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,560
Hold on.

1740
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Hold on.

1741
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
Just, uh.

1742
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,760
It's an envelope.

1743
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,840
This will trip you out.

1744
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
Let me read this.

1745
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,040
You guys are going to love it.

1746
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,280
The reptilians are out to get me.

1747
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,920
Okay, so it's a very nice heavy bond envelope paper and inside a number of different sheets,

1748
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,680
which I'll explain in a moment.

1749
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,680
And a card, you can hear it's very thick.

1750
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,680
Probably that's a good millimeter thick.

1751
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,400
It has a gold embossed edge, completely, that's probably real gold.

1752
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,560
And at the top it has the emblem of Queen Elizabeth.

1753
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,520
And I will show you this to you.

1754
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:17,360
The master of the household has received her Majesty's command to invite Mr. Adam Curry

1755
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:24,480
to a reception to be given at Buckingham Palace by the Queen to relaunch the monarchy website

1756
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:33,920
www.royal.gov.uk on Thursday, 12th of February, 2009 at noon.

1757
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:40,800
A reply is requested to the master of the household, Buckingham Palace, London S-W-1-A-1-A-A.

1758
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,040
Email Master.household at royal.gsx.gov.uk.

1759
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,720
How interesting is that?

1760
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,720
I'm going in.

1761
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:58,160
And of course, all recording devices are strictly prohibited, but, boy, I got to tell you,

1762
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:07,160
I feel that maybe I got to pull that old MP3 player recorder out and I might have to get

1763
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:13,480
the wireless set rigged up because you know I'm going to go, you know I'm going to,

1764
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,440
because who knows, maybe they just want to trap me.

1765
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,840
Throw me in the tower.

1766
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,680
Ah, so that shall be fun.

1767
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,720
Let me see, how long are we on time here about it?

1768
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,560
I want to keep this under an hour just a couple more, I actually should scan this thing.

1769
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,560
I will.

1770
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,440
I'll scan that and I'll put it up on Curry.com.

1771
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,040
Great article about the pirates, the Somali and pirates.

1772
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Please read this.

1773
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,760
It's in the show notes.

1774
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:49,480
It's from the independent and when you read this article and you first understand the background

1775
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:56,120
about pirates as we think of Johnny Depp Pirates of the Caribbean and what the romanticism

1776
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,640
of pirates and irony may be.

1777
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,580
But then the background of the dumping of toxic waste, the illegal fishing of Somali's

1778
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,720
waters, the illegal toxic waste dumping, by the way, of course, done by the West.

1779
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,720
These people are extremely desperate and this is pretty much the last resort, the last

1780
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
thing they can do.

1781
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,040
It's working for them because you don't read a lot about what's going on there in the

1782
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,360
mainstream media and when all you hear is pirate, you think, oh man, crappy pirates, kill

1783
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
them, get rid of them.

1784
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,080
But there's a lot more to the story and I encourage you to read that.

1785
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,720
That's definitely worth the conversation in the near future.

1786
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,400
Just some other things I just wanted to mention.

1787
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,880
This was just horrible.

1788
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,880
I always say your government doesn't love you.

1789
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,160
Well, the proof is in the pudding from CNN, the United States Army is apologizing to thousands

1790
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,800
of Army families who have received letters beginning with Dear John Doe after losing a loved

1791
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,720
one in Iraq or Afghanistan, not just a couple, 7,000 letters were sent in late December

1792
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,800
to notify families of services or gifts surviving family members can receive from non-profit

1793
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,000
organizations that help families of fallen soldiers.

1794
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,600
These are the people that want to keep the ID database.

1795
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,120
Better yet in the United Kingdom, they want to hand this over to commercial entities.

1796
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,760
You can't even keep track of people who fought for our country and died for our country.

1797
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:27,160
Shitheads, government doesn't love you, leave me, they do not love you.

1798
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
And then what is this?

1799
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,360
Oh, I'm a very happy note, like this.

1800
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:37,960
The power beam company, power beam preparing to deliver us wireless electricity, now it's

1801
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:46,320
not like they're doing big transfers yet, but they do say that it could start off quite

1802
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,400
nicely where you'd never have to hook up your cell phone, your iPhone or any other, you're

1803
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
iPod ever again.

1804
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,920
You just walk into the house and it starts charging.

1805
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,480
Of course, Tesla knew how to do this 100 years ago and all of the information on his

1806
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,080
wireless power tower, which he actually built in New York, go ahead Google it, you'll see

1807
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,080
it.

1808
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,920
That's gone missing, been destroyed.

1809
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,720
It's been suppressed, but he certainly was on to something really big.

1810
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,880
And then, oh, yes, I should add this to the Gardezill Merck, the company that makes

1811
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,600
Gardezill, this horrible drug, which is paralyzing and killing children, filed last month

1812
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,680
for approval from the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, the same people who passed

1813
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,400
this dangerous drug in just six, under six months of testing.

1814
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:36,240
That's for approval for males, give it to the boys now, ages 29 to 26, CNBC confirms

1815
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,240
it.

1816
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,080
Yeah, give it to the boys.

1817
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:47,200
We haven't killed enough children, holy crap, a reminder or actually a notification

1818
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:55,360
for this weekend on mevio today and probably I'll somehow get a food bar Friday out tomorrow.

1819
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,200
I've got a new song by the pretenders and I've also got three tickets to give away to

1820
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,400
their tour from the record label, who apparently someone over there listens to the show

1821
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
likes a lot.

1822
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,080
And we say, hey, would you mind spitting the record so I'm getting the MP3, it's good

1823
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:17,520
song by the way, Chrissy Hight, a little bit of her anti-social behavior, love that.

1824
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,280
And of course, tickets for one of the gigs on the tour.

1825
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,360
Here's the news.

1826
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,360
A cute, deep found, a good old rabbit light.

1827
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Someone left the light behind and plastic bag.

1828
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,360

scratch, which she tends to do almost every single day. I really appreciate you guys

1984
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,040
listening. I got a couple of calls in there. That was good. I wish I could make

1985
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:14,880
it sound better on the talk show system. Unfortunately, well, the biggest problem is

1986
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:21,080
that the new version of Skype, in fact, it may even be the beta versions or

1987
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:25,680
maybe you have to downgrade. It has automatic gain control turned on by default

1988
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,680
because I can literally see the max input volume changing, but there's no

1989
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,680
apparent place. I've looked in all the settings and all the options. There's

1990
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,760
no place to turn it off. They used to be as far as I can recall, so I might

1991
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,840
have to downgrade that because that is the biggest source of the sound

1992
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:50,040
problems. And otherwise, well, you know, it's back to trying to figure out the

1993
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,760
tip protocol and hack and then God knows what, but at least some version of it

1994
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:02,880
is working. Okay. Let me just hold on. Open up all the phones for everybody.

1995
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,560
Just want to say thank you all if you want to say something now is the time

1996
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,800
because we're going to shut her down. Yeah, thanks for the thing I love

1997
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:17,240
telling in there. All right, Bob. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. And everyone

1998
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:22,040
else seems to be hanging up. Okay. That's it for now. Back with you tomorrow for

1999
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:27,120
the food bar of how I'm already food bar. The food bar Friday festivities. I'll

2000
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,240
scan that to invitation. You'll get a hood out of it when you see that from the

2001
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,000
queen herself. I hope the gold shows up perfectly on the on the scan. You still

2002
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,400
got some freedom, exercise it, use it, stand up for your right and whatever

2003
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,920
you do. Live your life with passion. Another fine, medium presentation. Stick it in

2004
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,160
your ear.
