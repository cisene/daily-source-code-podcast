00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 817 Fubar Friday

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying with you to the future

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No Christina's got the body

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She really lacks the spin and fur

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But when she's flirting with the camera

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
She's just a little girl

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now pink is cute but still a baby

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And she talks with attitude

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
She has some scum for a young lady

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But what I'd be like to do

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She is what's the woman's face

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All the time I want to get to meet me

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When Britney sings a sound of music

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Like a belly and a bird

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But how would you let's be with her

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She's always hanging with them all

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She's what a woman's supposed to be

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The only girl I ever need

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I'd rather do it with me

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She really got me on her knees

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The only girl I ever need

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I'd rather do it with me

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'd really like to be with Kylie

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
She's feeling really hard

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I wonder if I can get Kylie

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She's really got me on my knees

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All my tongue won't you do it with me

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's what a woman's supposed to be

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The only girl I ever need

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But I'd rather do it with my tongue

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She's feeling really hard

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She's feeling really hard

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'd rather do it with my tongue

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't know if I'd want to do it with Madonna anymore

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There was a time perhaps

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
From their longer

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Food bar Friday everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code episode

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
One, seven coming to you from the Curry Terrace in Southwest London.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's been way too long once again, and I apologize profusely.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Life got in the way is usual.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Actually, with the, with the preview today stuff that I'm getting better at it,

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and I'm working really hard, and I'm doing everything.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Editor, producer, writer, cameraman, audio guy, and oh yeah, asshole talent.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Very different, all very challenging to get everything right.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
One thing goes wrong, and it could be hours and hours of extra work, but I think I've kind of got it under control.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And almost had to show out yesterday, but it was nine o'clock by the time I was finally done with dinner,

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and I wanted to sit with the girls, Patricia Kristina, and Dex, by the way, was pretty much now a full fledged member of the family.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Kristina's bow.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Good kid, man, he's sure's helping me out. Oh, what? He's a final cut wizard.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Got to love it.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So, I've got a whole week's worth of news, which is really too much to go through even for a food bar,

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
or maybe even particular for a food bar show.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So I'm going to try and work through my list and reverse alphabetical reverse chronological order, I should say.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
With yesterday, last night, as I went upstairs, we were going to watch celebrity Big Brother,

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
which, once again, is I'm loving the show so much.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My favorites have got to be Coolio, who's in the Big Brother house here in the United Kingdom,

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Verne, known as Minini, from Austin Powers, he's in.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, uh, Latoya Jackson, who is just a really, she's very nice.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My favorite right now, just because she's smoking hot is Michelle.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I actually from some dinky girl group, I don't know, S club seven or steps or something like that.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have no idea what she's from, but man, she's hot.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, I'm ready to watch that.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And I glance over my screen where I have CNBC streaming on the sling box from my good friend, in Detroit.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think it's Detroit or Chicago. I don't know, we do so many shows in the row.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I see an airbus in the Hudson River and like, oh my god, check that out.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And, uh, look like a very successful ditch attempt by the pilot.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, just phenomenal job on, on getting that plane down.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's a whole bunch of data points that I've been collecting.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One is a flight track from, what does that mean?

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Maybe that's flighttracker.com or something, a flight aware, there you go.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You can literally see the plane do a dog leg and head back towards LaGuardia.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And you see the track end right there in the Hudson River.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's funny about it though on flight, flight aware, this flight tracker.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It has data. So, departure, scheduled 304 p.m.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Eastern, actual, or estimated 326 p.m. Eastern.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Arrival time, scheduled 438 p.m.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It was on its way to, uh, where's it going to?

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I forget KCLT.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Doesn't make, it wasn't going to Tempe, was it?

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I think it was going to Tempe Arizona.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But anyway, the actual arrival time, remember, actual departure time 326, actual arrival time 332.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Unfortunately, got short change on your ticket.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You landed up in the Hudson, didn't get that far.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But wow, phenomenal. And I'm so disappointed that no one has this ditch landing on video tape.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Maybe it still has the surface. I've also been surfing around a lot of the aviation boards.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not just a pilot. I play one on the podcast as well.

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And I was looking for the, so there's really two data points that I'm interested in.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
One is I'd like to hear the air traffic control report where the captain calls in and says,

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Look, we've flown through a flock of geese and we have, we're losing power.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So we're turning back. That would be really nice to catch that. I can't seem to find it.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I did find this piece though, and I listened to this.

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This is from, this is actually from JFK, and they do reference what's going on at LaGuardia.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hello, my aunt, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie, auntie,

108
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, these questions still to be answered, but very, very happy that everyone made it out and everyone made it out safe, and still hoping I can, I would have fantastic landing that must be to watch, so I'm really hoping that I get a video of that somewhere.

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:17,000
All right, Fubar Friday, the festivities should begin, let's begin them in style, and we have the hit test, 156 coming up, a little bit of phone lines for that.

110
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:27,000
People can participate, I know the sound is still kind of shitty, I'm talking to you, but, be fine if you guess one or two.

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Time to kick back for three and a half minutes, you know what I'm going to do, man.

112
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Just a tradition on Friday, you know.

113
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
To be hardworking, man.

114
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
My mama, she wants to be something who's who the best you can.

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But then one day, I met a man who came from me and said,

116
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hard work, good, and hard work, fine.

117
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But first take care of him, so now I smoke to judge, when I get up, in the car I smoke to judge.

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I smoke to judge, when I get a video game, and then every 10,000 points I smoke to judge.

119
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I smoke to judge, in time of peace, and two in time of war.

120
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I smoke to judge, before I smoke to judge, and there I smoke to more.

121
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm a daddy, he wants to listen, he'll be hard working now, my mama, he wants to listen, he'll do the best you can

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But say no one day, I met him, I gave you me a day, a hot one good, and a hot one fine, so take care of it

123
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's why I spoke to you this city morning, I spoke to you this night, I spoke to you this city afternoon, it makes me feel alright

125
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:11,000

of course we had the penis poster come by and from time to time this via grads that

142
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,440
show up and I do look at the drop obviously several times a day and I work on

143
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,600
you know removing stuff that is just lame irrelevant etc. I don't really remove

144
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:30,000
so much but there's people seem that you know they want to make it into like a

145
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,640
community type thing like a dig rating etc and I'm against that and let me

146
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,840
tell you why because I've seen this time and time again whenever you pull a community

147
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:49,120
together and you put them into some form of space where someone has power over that

148
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,200
space or more than one person from the community has any form of power it just

149
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,200
turns into crap every it with any type of list whether it's you know it doesn't

150
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,040
really matter what the topic is about even engineering stuff it just turns into

151
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,640
a mosh pit of bullshit in fact I feel that this whole thing about Steve Jobs

152
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,880
which everyone just jumped on that it's like you know for some reason communities

153
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,840
online have a really good way of self-destructing and I'm actually going to blame a

154
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,360
lot of these problems that Jobs has not the health problems necessarily but just

155
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,840
the company problems on you know the very own community that he's in charge of

156
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,480
because you know they they are very restricted they keep news close to the chest

157
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,640
and somehow communities just seem to self-destruct so I like the idea of having

158
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,640
well of course we have a community we're all chuckle heads but I I want it to be

159
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,000
free form free flow and just keep it going you know there's ups and downs and

160
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,880
the drop sometimes sucks and other times it's brilliant and I don't mind that people

161
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,960
double post things it's in fact you know whenever I see something I immediately

162
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,240
grab it and you can also do some interesting things with drop.io you can start

163
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,560
your own drop and if you see a story an article or something has been uploaded you

164
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,320
like you can send it to your own drops you can have your own little personal archive

165
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,000
you can create derivatives of the of the source code drop there's just tons of

166
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,960
things you can do and I would actually like to ask you for the listeners around the

167
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:36,960
world we're doing some coverage inaugural coverage of president elect Barack Obama on Monday

168
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,520
and Tuesday Monday is also pretty important day in in in context of in inauguration

169
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,320
day and Tuesday Monday is Martin Luther King Day and what I'd like to do is on Nivia

170
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,840
today I'd like to show little snippets of people around the world and what they expect

171
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,080
from the new president you know what their feelings are and if you feel like recording

172
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,520
something going out to your favorite bar on the street whatever maybe there's an inauguration

173
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,680
party you're going to if you just upload it to a drop I think each drop gets 100

174
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,120
100 megabytes free by default so that should be more than enough just upload it send me the link

175
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,400
and if you email it to Adam and Nivia.com I put uh Barack clip in the subject so I don't have to

176
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,360
go sorting through everything and I don't miss it if it's you know if it's arable and it's good

177
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,000
then I'd love to use some of that because I think it'll be fun to show this stuff around the globe

178
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,600
and I'll I'm perfectly happy Monday and Tuesday to create you know new episodes every you know

179
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,040
every couple of hours to update those clips and I will I guess I'll post something about this on

180
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,680
couried.com perhaps I'll put it in the show notes at the dailysourcecode.com all right let's see

181
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,280
what we've got going on hit a couple audio comments here for a second Adam here at the Portland

182
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,000
Eric and bankers are in basal yes the basal Switzerland fed chairman Ben Bernanke and his central

183
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,920
banking counterparts have all met this week in uh basal Switzerland yeah you know I know about that

184
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,360
and I actually um Ben Bernanke was in London at the London School of Economics and he did this whole

185
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,960
big thing about uh how they need to spend more of our money to bail out his buddies

186
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,840
there was uh I'm seeing if I can find it somewhere there was an excellent um let me see there was a

187
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,360
just a fantastic youtube video where someone asked him point blank and said hey you know

188
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,920
this shit you're doing it working um you know how can you say that this is the way to go

189
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,400
Mr. expert on the great depression and he gave like a 15 minute answer that said absolutely nothing

190
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,480
let me see maybe it was part of the tarp uh financial services hearing let me just see you know that's

191
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,760
Ron Paul we'll save that when I'll play that in a second anyway yeah so they were in basal this

192
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,360
bank of international settlements very very uh very um shady type of operation it feels like but

193
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,960
international settlement this is basically where all the gangs from all the different countries who

194
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,920
rule the world um settle their money I presume but that's just my presumption.

195
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,160
I get this it's called the bank of international settlements sounds very serious there is no news

196
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,200
in the mainstream media on this I wonder if you had any insight or European news on that

197
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,200
on a personal note I will be heading to Pakistan next week on a business trip and if I

198
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
earn anything new there from the people I talked to I'll be sure to drop a comment.

199
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,400
Okay right now I'm listening to the uh to the comment at the same time I'm looking at the

200
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,440
comments in the in the chat room it talks you people are saying the stream is over modulate other

201
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
people say it isn't over modulate I just hope the recording is okay I did test it before I went

202
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,160
on air so doesn't seem like audio silly is it okay so young poet is uh is saying audio

203
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:19,520
still over modulated please specify if this is um on the stream or if it's in talks you

204
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,160
because that's what I need to know you know I'm gonna play another song real quick I got to open

205
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,760
up the door and post some some reports that I can really work where if you don't mind post those

206
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:38,880
in the talks you chat will I'll be right back. similarly in India I'm not hundreds but

207
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,880
millions of us would be ashamed and offended if we weren't anyway implicated with the present

208
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,040
Indian government's fastest policies which apart from the perpetration or state terrorism

209
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,520
in the valley of Kashmir in the name of fighting terrorism have also turned a blind eye to the recent

210
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,320
state supervised program against Muslims in good job it would be absurd to think that those who criticize

211
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,920
the Indian government are anti-Indian although the government itself never hesitates to take that

212
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:17,120
line it is dangerous to seed to the Indian government or the American government or anyone for that

213
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:25,120
matter the right to define what India or America are or to be to cause someone anti-American

214
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,880
indeed to be anti-American or for that matter anti-Indian or anti-Tingled Tune is not just racist

215
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,400
it's a failure of the imagination then inability to see a world in terms other than those the

216
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,120
establishment has set out for you if you're not a bushy you're a Taliban if you don't love us

217
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,280
you hate us if you're not good you're evil like many others I too made the mistake of scoffing

218
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,480
at this post September 11 rhetoric this missing it as foolish and arrogant but I realize that it's

219
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,120
not foolish at all it's actually a canny recruitment drive for a misconceived dangerous world

220
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,920
every day I'm taking a back at how many people believe that opposing the war in Afghanistan

221
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,560
amounts to supporting terrorism or voting for the Taliban now that the initial aim of the war

222
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,840
capturing Osama bin Laden dead or alive seems to have run into bad weather the gold posts have been moved

223
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,160
it's been made out the whole point of the war was to tap topple the Taliban regime and liberate

224
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,080
of gun women from their burqas we are being asked to believe that the US Marines are actually on a feminist

225
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:55,840
mission if so if so will the next stop be America's military allies Saudi Arabia think of it

226
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,000
this way in India there are some pretty reprehensible social practices against untouchables against

227
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,480
Christians and Muslims against women Pakistan and Bangladesh have even worse ways of dealing with

228
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,360
minority communities and women should they be bombed should Delhi Islamabad and Dakar be destroyed

229
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,000
is it possible to bomb bigotry out of India kick kick kick kick kick kick can we bomb our way to a feminist

230
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
paradise

231
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,960
I'm not quite sure what that is but I thought it was freaky enough to play for you Roy versus DJ Spooky

232
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,200
on Delta Sheriff Charlie 817 see wonderful fade out I knew someone was going to be messed up with

233
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,480
that all right so I've adjusted whatever I could on on the on the stream and talk to you

234
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,080
and that's all I can do now the tough shit that we just have to live with it now don't we

235
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,520
all right let me get into uh get us some uh into some stories here this is actually quite

236
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,760
interesting that now why is my uh hmm now actually the sound of my headphones is actually lower

237
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,120
oh well I don't know food bard makes total sense doesn't it

238
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:40,400
tomorrow uh January 17th 2009 there's going to be a huge protest in London protesting the conflict

239
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,440
in the Gaza Strip I do not believe it is necessarily anti-Israeli or for that matter anti-Hamas

240
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,480
but it will start at Trafalgar Square not far from the curry terrace and I've already announced to

241
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,960
the children to Christina and Dexter 18 and 19 years old respectively that I am taking them with me to

242
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,000
the demonstration I want them to see it because um it's just these kids you know most of them

243
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,680
they'll just see shit on television they're on another protest a lot of people showed up

244
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I want them to witness it I want them to see uh anger and uh and witness and understand why people are

245
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,280
angry and uh they actually are quite excited about going and Dexter was immediately saying oh man let's

246
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,080
let's do some video I'm like no we're going to be concentrating on what's going on I might

247
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,560
record some audio it's easy just take along a little record but I don't want to do video because I

248
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,320
also know that I'm sure that I'll be the guy that the cost come up to and say you got to

249
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,040
turn off your camera and then they'll say delete your uh your footage and I'll say no and I'll be

250
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:49,840
arrested and I'm not looking forward to that so that is tomorrow January 17th 2009 in London

251
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,240
kicking off at Trafalgar Square and there's all kinds of links as a fantastic site that someone gave me

252
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:05,360
anything I think it's called uh the global day of action dot org yeah global day of action dot org

253
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,880
now they've got another one scheduled for January 24th and the assembly there will be at the BBC

254
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:23,440
broadcasting house as uh we're now looking at uh thousand dead and of course you saw the the news

255
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,160
about the bombing of the UN building it's just it's despicable and I'm still really just

256
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,080
reeling from the fact that the United States as the only member of the 15 member security council

257
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:44,800
the United Nations which of course clearly is a fricking scam declined to vote against uh

258
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:54,160
uh what do you call it the resolution that the United Nations calls for an immediate ceasefire

259
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:03,680
oh man it's disgusting really is hmm let's run through a couple of articles again in reverse

260
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,360
chronological order in which they came in and when I think something's too old they'll just stop

261
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,720
but this first post dot code i UK has been entertaining me with a lot of their writing remember

262
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,480
this is still kind of a mainstream publication and what's interesting about this article written

263
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,240
by David Cox titled it could come to this a calamitous recession could lead to public unrest

264
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,960
and uh he lays out in some very great detail the reason why we're not seeing any of these riots

265
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,080
a reported widely on television and why the government's uh particularly Gordon Brown is just

266
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,880
spewing bold for bold-faced lies is they're very worried that the populace will become upset

267
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,160
and take to the streets every day you see companies laying off thousands of people it's coming

268
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,760
to ahead i think that they're at uh six to seven percent unemployment now they're expecting 11 to 12 percent

269
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,800
unemployment rate in the United Kingdom this is just a small last island man it's could be very

270
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,920
very complicated it's a great article i suggest you read that a little bit of homework uh link

271
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,560
in the drop uh link in the show notes at the daily source code dot com cross posted

272
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:15,440
at uh korea dot com great new invention you know i'm always on the lookout for some new type of

273
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:27,600
energy this uh link comes from technobob dot com the nopopo battery this is great of course

274
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,960
it comes from japan their little uh batteries now what they're showing here are penlights double

275
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,760
a batteries and there's a little applicator you can actually recharge these things with urine

276
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,960
like what you're having to recharge as you get out of it but it said the aqua power system

277
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,280
and you can uh well i say urine but you can recharge it with fluids such as beer, apple juice,

278
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:01,440
cola, saliva and yes indeed urine and uh i'm not sure where they're called nopopo it's kind of

279
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,840
shitty ass name but the packaging is great you see two penlight batteries two double ains and

280
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,560
little like applicator thingy with the you stick into the battery and there's actually a picture

281
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,640
of some like yellow goo in it yeah that's marketing for you man i love that

282
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,400
i posted this on korea dot com yesterday just out of sheer glee it's uh from cnn

283
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,280
done by Glenn Beck it is a youtube video you should be passing on to all of your friends far and

284
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,040
wide and i'm gonna play a little bit of it because it really it just repeats everything we've

285
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,920
been talking about here when it comes to uh climate change it's called the global warming hoax

286
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,560
listen to a little bit you'll get the idea pretty quickly severe storms

287
00:30:51,440 --> 00:31:00,320
devastating hurricanes and massive walls of sea pummeling into major cities these are the kind of

288
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,160
extremes that movies like the day after tomorrow propagate about global warming even take

289
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:14,720
gillet all is it safe this grace you know it's vague what you can get similar stories from

290
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:23,600
convincing actors and no cool special effects but you're still getting all the trouble so the whole piece

291
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,160
is really about the about the news organizations which uh correctly identified art now businesses

292
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,920
have to make money it's been going on since the first uh desert storm the original invasion in the

293
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,240
early 90s it's a big money profit profitable money making business and it works based upon fear

294
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,840
and hype and drama and man it's so easy to do that with images just look what i'm doing all by

295
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,440
myself on that media today stuff you can do quite a bit and manipulation is quite easy you just got

296
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,800
to show the images have the right voice over and boom you're done and it really goes into great

297
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:05,040
detail um it's about nine nine and a half minutes you must watch this clip you will not be disappointed

298
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:12,480
guarantee it all right vaccination time see what this is i had a bit of it just just called up to

299
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,080
you on last week's episode of private practice and why would you be interested in that why

300
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,000
because last week's episode was all about vaccinating your children after recent criticisms of vaccines

301
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,600
by parents big farmer has fired back with the latest episode of private practice i'm particularly

302
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,320
interested in this debate being the father of a two and a half year old son on the autism spectrum

303
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,360
personally i'm not totally comfortable with the chemicals injected into our children today

304
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,160
and i believe it should be the parents decision after proper discussion of the risks and benefits

305
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,200
of each vaccination right on doctors in my experience treat these procedures far too lightly

306
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,280
under the orders of public health officials although i do not believe our sons of

307
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,200
vaccinations cause is autism i do take offense to the latest episode of private practice last week

308
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,680
a mother refused to vaccinate the younger brothers her her artistic son due to the risk of the

309
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,520
injections and due to the mother refusing these vaccinations one of her sons contracts and

310
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,880
eventually dies of measles the show could not have put it more clearly vaccinate your children

311
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,080
or they will die i can't begin to think of what i would do if i had to make the decision again

312
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,200
all i do know is that the show definitely forms a negative public opinion of parents who choose

313
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,640
not to have the children vaccinated thank you for furthering awareness of the risks of vaccinations

314
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,920
it's something every parent should at least be aware of love you mean it and wouldn't it be nice if

315
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,840
they worked for us we got a reminder man i was on i went into town to the west end

316
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,000
earlier this morning i'd pick up a battery charger and some some batteries for the for the camera

317
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,640
and there were guys in the tree outside of the ministry of defense protesting hanging in the

318
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,560
tree it's starting it's starting everywhere people are on the streets and you can see that the

319
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:07,200
the police are ready for it if got to barricades all over the place and has definitely

320
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,480
enhanced security going on rightfully so i would say but i'm hoping that everything can be quite

321
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,280
calm tomorrow but probably it just doesn't take much and what's crazy about these protests and

322
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,040
these are happening still worldwide what's crazy about them is people going after big globalist companies

323
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,960
like Starbucks McDonald's from Coca-Cola and that kind of destruction does get attention for sure

324
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
so we'll have to see where it leads but we're just i guess the best thing we could do right now is just

325
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:51,120
keep our eyes on it and see what's coming strip comic strip comic strip comic strip comic strip

326
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,920
comic strip go you'll see us be come on in my body hello there hello how are you at the

327
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm good man here is csb your eucor espondent Adam yes you obviously were born with a silver spoon in the

328
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:16,320
earth this is what so many people think no man i'm pretty lower middle class my friends so you don't

329
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,800
so i don't know if you know if you ever were bullied in your life are you kidding me in 1972

330
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,320
as an american moving to europe americans were universally hated for vietnam at the time

331
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,240
we were taking over jobs a Texas instruments was moving in 70s was a very very difficult time

332
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,320
and and america was severely understood we're talking about nixon you know we were evil people

333
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:49,280
i was yelled at i was shot at with paper darts and and berries from pbc piping i was called names

334
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,040
yeah i think i know what it's like to be bullied csb have you been but these days your opinion is

335
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,600
being bullied by russia who is using proxy here you're creating to bully you in our blame game

336
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,320
you can't is by cutting off gas supply whether more nobody can do anything to consume rations because

337
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,840
they have 30 year contracts with various countries so screw global warming i mean climate change

338
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,760
it is bullshit and that is of the issue of energy where is this fucking code fusion generator

339
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,280
or something and congratulations to you on becoming alone on our other yeah thank you you thank you very

340
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:34,400
much csb it was uh let's see if i can find this uh it was article and uh an associated youtube

341
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,040
video here we go saltwater burns dot com i've i've i've i remember looking at this probably a

342
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:48,720
year ago and it really trips me out every single time i watch it this is a guy who was um originally

343
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,320
looking for a cure for cancer guys a doctor so he has a little bit of a lab

344
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:05,840
and what his search led him to an accidental discovery is that by sending a certain frequency

345
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,840
onto saltwater plain saltwater right out of the sea or any other saltwater you know natural saltwater

346
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:20,400
source he can actually light and make the saltwater burn so i believe and from what i understand

347
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:28,240
from these videos somehow he's creating hydrogen from the water but not doing it through the typical

348
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:36,320
means of electrolysis by actually sticking electrodes into the water with a current running through

349
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,880
it but he's doing it externally with frequencies and he doesn't in this youtube video and i can't

350
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,320
say otherwise that it looks damaged it now of course the implication of being able to

351
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:58,160
you saltwater as a fuel source i mean that boggles the mind because you know once once it

352
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,200
heats something well then you can you can create a turbine you can go back to old fashion steam

353
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,800
engine you know there's a million different ways you can use it but wow burning saltwater i can

354
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,520
see people laughing about it in the in the chat room but it's true and you should watch these

355
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,080
youtube videos saltwater burns dot com is where you can see it it's it's extremely trippy there's a

356
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:26,320
couple other resources on that site it's been featured on sixty minutes popular science i've got

357
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,520
to catch up on what this guy is doing i guess the trick is to understand what frequency he's been

358
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,760
into this water and i mean that's getting very close to removing all the problems of the world

359
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,720
which of course means we're probably never here from the good doctor again because he'll be killed

360
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
because this one's way too good i mean i've seen the magnet engines and i like those a lot and

361
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,720
you know there's a lot of questions about how those operate but this looks really clean and

362
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,800
can you imagine if all you had to do was had some kind of box with you that you could just

363
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,120
set next to a glass of saltwater and that would be fuel and you could light that and you could

364
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,440
not mean that just imagine the things we can create if we have that type of power i gotta say

365
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,520
that just be spectacular so that's what i'd be looking for csb got to tell you i feel good

366
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,840
about being in the Londoner actually i really do and i feel very involved in the city and it's

367
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:23,440
good you know i'm kind of a new yorker although i really didn't live in new york city that long but

368
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,800
both Patricia and i feel were urbanites and we're here in southwest London so we're not not in

369
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,720
Chelsea which is just a little bit up the road because that's where your neighbors essentially are

370
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,000
just all rushons and you got to get in a car to go somewhere interesting and here we just walk

371
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,080
out and turn left and turn right and then your boom you're right in the middle of the action

372
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,440
and uh really am enjoying that i was going to start a new mission on the the source code i was going

373
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,240
to start up every show with where's all summer been ladden where is he because of course

374
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
with all this fighting in the gaza strip you'd expect him to be out there and say no i had this

375
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,640
got to stop we need to kill americans and kill all the westerners and we have to do away with

376
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,840
everybody and well so then they i guess they finally thought it was time they did something as well so

377
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:21,120
apparently there's some audio tape that came out you know how lame is that and it's no longer

378
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:28,800
top priority for our president elect to kill him that's what i found most interesting so not only

379
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,600
and i'm just gonna say it you know this is fabrication you know why don't we on one hand

380
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,480
lower the expectations very buddy yeah we don't have to go and kill the guy anymore he's incapacitated

381
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,360
and the other hand let's uh make sure that he still appears to be alive and i just can't believe he is

382
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,760
brock obama suggested last night removing us out and been ladden from the battlefield was no

383
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,040
longer essential in that america security goals could be achieved nearly by keeping alchita on the run

384
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,120
even though at the top of his list is obliterate alchita kill or capture been ladden so he's

385
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:08,720
already breaking his promises the top of the list my preference obviously would be to capture or kill

386
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,600
him obama said but if we have so tightened the news that he's in a cave somewhere and can't even

387
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,520
communicate with his operatives then we will meet our goal of protecting america excuse me

388
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,680
what the f are you talking about so okay so now we know he's in the cave and he can't communicate he

389
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,880
can just barely get out little MP3 file they're posted on the website and where is that file

390
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
there's never a link to it on these mainstream sites that you never hear it on the news uh oh

391
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,760
well they got another tape interview uh no tape was released and you never hear it

392
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,600
and it's never verified yeah by some pentagon official sure that's who we have verifies it

393
00:41:50,480 --> 00:42:02,240
pisses me off liars just the lies it's just becoming too much let's see uh what else do we have

394
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,600
obama and uh Biden visited the supreme court because of course they'll have some say over the

395
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,720
justices there I call it casing the joint not a visit they're getting ready because the big

396
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,400
hijack is about to take place and I've also been watching these confirmation hearings

397
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:30,480
Timothy Geitner's fantastic uh this is who president elect obama would like to have in as I believe

398
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,920
treasury secretary let me just double check on that I thought it was treasury secretary

399
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,160
he's no stranger by the way to the position uh little problem there uh didn't pay as taxes

400
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,560
in 2006 two years he forgot to pay let me tell you something

401
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,960
when we started our company in the United States you know I've been filing taxes you don't

402
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,760
have to pay taxes in multiple countries you pay it in the country you work in and where you get paid

403
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,840
so I've been paying all kinds of taxes out of my butt all the time in the Netherlands and partially

404
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,760
in the UK for a good portion of the eight nine years so we start this company and my name shows

405
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:23,760
up somewhere the IRS came into our offices with their hands on their weapons okay hands on their guns

406
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,160
we want curried of course it wasn't even in the country and for this guy uh you'll get confirmed

407
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,640
didn't pay as taxes here's something else that happened yesterday this this is uh for those

408
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,160
even the United Kingdom you will you will really should have brick when you hear this so I still have

409
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,000
a rental property there's a couple more payments you know in this transition to the new home

410
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,520
and it's through foxtons foxtons is the real estate agent anyway they manage that property for the owner

411
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,360
and uh I read about a week and a half ago that foxtons wasn't financial trouble

412
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,840
and that's understandable because houses are not moving they still got the overhead so they're

413
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,440
firing people left and right there's all kinds of shit going on but they're in financial trouble

414
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,800
but when you send your your rent check you send it to them and they then uh take whatever

415
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,200
management fee and anything else that needs to be deducted and they send it off to the owner

416
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,640
the remainder of the balance so normally this is paid on the 29th of the month and uh there was

417
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:28,160
you know payment going out final payment on the 29th of January and it was transferred uh on the

418
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,440
14th and I just I just saw it by uh by accident really and I'm looking at him like that's strange

419
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,440
so I call him up and the first thing the guy said I know of course I'm a dick I should have recorded it

420
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,400
but the first thing the guy said was all of me uh let me talk to uh let me talk to some of

421
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,520
you right back and comes back as well yeah it looks like that happened by mistake um you know and

422
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,320
by the way my bank for this particular transaction is Barclays Bank it's important for the story

423
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,320
do you mind if you just consider that the payment and we will make sure no payment goes on

424
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:05,200
on the 29th and I said no that's unacceptable we have a contract it's a standing order is what

425
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,080
it's called so it's automatically transferred on the 29th of each month I said we have a legal

426
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,040
document I had to sign this it couldn't even do it over the internet I had to confirm with my signature

427
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,800
that this money can be transferred once a month from this account to that account it doesn't mean

428
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,320
on the 14th so you're breaking our agreement well yes hold on a second and guy comes back well

429
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,520
Mr. Curry we have two options one is uh you can call um you can call them you can call uh

430
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,280
Foxdons and have them transfer the money back to you because the alternative really will take seven to eight

431
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,240
weeks as we have to go through all these procedures and I said no you're misunderstanding something okay

432
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,440
I believe that something very fishy is going on is what I said and I know you're recording this

433
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,400
call because all of them are so listen very carefully I said Foxdons isn't deep financial trouble

434
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,920
do you think it's possible that the bank made a kind of a decision or a deal to help them out

435
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,360
by transferring some or maybe all of these standing orders two weeks in advance is that possible do you

436
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,480
think maybe you should get me a supervisor so get the supervisor go through the whole rap

437
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,320
and uh and I and I'm getting really annoyed you know the guys well we well we can't do this and you

438
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,160
know this is the unfortunate mistake I said look do you know who John Gages now so he's the editor

439
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,080
of the sun he's my next phone call with this exact same story call on a second Mr. Curry call

440
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,400

441
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,400

442
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:46,080

476
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,680
That, I love that.

477
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Quick note.

478
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:06,680
Parker, uh, Parker London sent me this and I see a Twitter tweet from Fargo.

479
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,680
That, uh, Zimbabwe has now released a $1 trillion note.

480
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,680
I had the $100 billion one, which I scanned and put on flicker a while back.

481
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,680
But now they have a $100 trillion note.

482
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,680
This is the direction that we, of course, are headed in.

483
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,680
And I'm, you know, I've been watching CNBC almost every single morning.

484
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,680
And you just, you know, they're, they're literally yelling at the government on, on this,

485
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,680
watch squat box in the morning.

486
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,680
They're so angry because already in the first, you know, two weeks.

487
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,680
The, the deficit is already in the hundreds of billions.

488
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,680
Bank of America, $138 billion of our money.

489
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,680
We're printing it.

490
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
The printing presses are in high gear.

491
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
It's just, it's out of control.

492
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,680
All right.

493
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,680
So we've got a number of people on, uh, who are dialed in.

494
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Um, I know the sound is all messed up, but, you know, just to stay in the,

495
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,680
to stay in the habit of doing it.

496
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,680
Let's see if we can do, uh, this week's hit test.

497
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
All together.

498
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,680
What's that?

499
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,680
Are you able to hear me?

500
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
Yeah, I can hear you fun.

501
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,680
All right.

502
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Awesome.

503
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
Okay.

504
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,680
Okay.

505
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,680
That's groomsy, right?

506
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,680
Okay.

507
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,680
All right.

508
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,680
Okay.

509
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,680
Guys.

510
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Let's see if we can, uh, figure out what the songs are in today's hit test.

511
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
All right.

512
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
All right.

513
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
I've heard a rumor.

514
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,680
I know that one.

515
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,680
All right.

516
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Anybody on the, talks you know?

517
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
Okay.

518
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
All right.

519
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,680
All right.

520
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
All right.

521
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
All right.

522
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,680
I've heard a rumor.

523
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,680
I know that one.

524
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,680
All right.

525
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,680
Anybody on the, talks you know?

526
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,680
I think I look at it.

527
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,680
Yeah.

528
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,680
Banana Rama.

529
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
Number two.

530
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,680
Oh, that's an easy one.

531
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,680
All right.

532
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,680
Talks you people?

533
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,680
It really hurt.

534
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,680
Yeah.

535
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Breaking up the bad on my phone.

536
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,680
It's Duran Duran Reflex.

537
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,680
And number three.

538
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,680
Got it.

539
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,680
Yeah.

540
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,680
Yeah.

541
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,680
Yeah.

542
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,680
This is like,

543
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,680
John's given it away with that one, then.

544
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,680
Pride in the name of love.

545
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,680
And it's time for the answer.

546
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,680
Sorry.

547
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,680
And this is answer number one.

548
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,680
You may sing along.

549
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,680
But not a Rama.

550
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,680
It's my duty.

551
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,680
Seven.

552
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,680
Who's friends?

553
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,680
You never show.

554
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,680
I'll tell you what you want to know.

555
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,680
I love a girl.

556
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
I love a girl.

557
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
I love a girl.

558
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
They say you got a broken heart.

559
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,680
I'll let her roam her.

560
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
Yes.

561
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,680
I'll tell you what you want to know.

562
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,680
Yes.

563
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,680
Number one.

564
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,680
Banana Rama.

565
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,680
I heard a rumor.

566
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,680
And this is number two.

567
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,680
Man.

568
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,680
You've got some fun this time.

569
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,680
But I've never been on the bad line.

570
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,680
You've never been on the bad line.

571
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,680
You've never been on the bad line.

572
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,680
You've never been on the bad line.

573
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,680
And we've made a way in the reflex.

574
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,680
Does.

575
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,680
Does.

576
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,680
Does.

577
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,680
Do.

578
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,680
Do.

579
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,680
Flat.

580
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,680
Flex.

581
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
The reflex.

582
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,680
Your answer.

583
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
Number two.

584
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
Oh.

585
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,680
The answer.

586
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
Number three.

587
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,680
Three.

588
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,680
Four.

589
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,680
You never come in the middle of love.

590
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,680
One man.

591
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,680
You never come in the middle of love.

592
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,680
And the.

593
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,680
My love.

594
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
And.

595
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,680
My love.

596
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,680
And.

597
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,680
My love.

598
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,680
My love.

599
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,680
My love.

600
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
That's number three.

601
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,680
That's number three.

602
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Try it in the name of love.

603
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,680
You too.

604
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,680
And that concludes.

605
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
It has number one.

606
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,680
Fifty six.

607
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,680
Yeah.

608
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,680
So Adam.

609
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,680
Well.

610
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,680
You have to do this week.

611
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,680
Dude.

612
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,680
Six out of six.

613
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,680
Kind of me.

614
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,680
Nailed it.

615
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,680
Got to fix the audio on this talk shoot thing.

616
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,680
It's pissing me off.

617
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,680
I know people would have fun playing.

618
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
If only they could actually hear it.

619
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
Right.

620
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,680
The answer.

621
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,680
To this hit this.

622
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,680
And also the iTunes link.

623
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,680
So you can buy this right.

624
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,680
Featured on the hit test online.

625
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,680
To be found.

626
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,680
The hit test that mevio.com.

627
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,680
Thanks for playing Adam.

628
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,680
Thank you.

629
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,680
Everyone else.

630
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,680
Thanks for listening.

631
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,680
Next week.

632
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,680
I'll be back for another hit test.

633
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,680
So until then.

634
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,180
Have fun.

635
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,180
Take care.

636
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,180
And remember to try to think with your hearts.

637
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,180
Bye-bye.

638
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,180
Keep back.

639
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,180
Test that she will.com.

640
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,180
Y'all pull a dot com.

641
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:38,180
J-N-P-O-L-C-T-D-A-C-O-N.

642
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,180
I really got to figure something out.

643
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Maybe I...

644
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,180
They actually, they do have a VoIP dialing, which is interesting.

645
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:50,180
So I got to put the other router on because I can't use my gizmo VoIP setup.

646
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,180
I've tried port forwarding everything.

647
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,180
They may be doing something nasty or their BT.

648
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,180
And I still don't have the version 20 megabit line in.

649
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:04,180
I don't think I can get the 50 megabit here.

650
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,180
Just this got to sound better.

651
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
It's got to make it better.

652
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,180
And I've got to figure out what this distortion is coming from.

653
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:12,180
Because I'm really doing everything by the book and on the meters.

654
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,180
And still is...

655
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,180
God knows how it's going to sound.

656
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,180
Once I play back the recording.

657
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,180
God, I hope it's not over much.

658
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,180
It sounds so bad.

659
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
Okay.

660
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,180
What do I got here?

661
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,180
I want to wrap it up pretty quickly.

662
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,180
Here's some very good and interesting data points.

663
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,180
Because you're not going to hear about this in mainstream news.

664
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,180
Well, actually, this is a mainstream article,

665
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,180
but I don't think people understand the significance of the shipping rates.

666
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,180
So when you ship something, of course these days,

667
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,180
just about everything is sent via standard size container.

668
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,180
And you ship it from typically China, of course.

669
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,180
There's a cost involves.

670
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:59,180
Well, freight rates for container ship from Asia to Europe have fallen to zero.

671
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,180
For the first time since records began,

672
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,180
underscoring the dramatic collapse in trades

673
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,180
since the world economy buckled in October.

674
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,180
And there's all kinds of experts in this article saying

675
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,180
that they've never witnessed this before.

676
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,180
Imagine that.

677
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,180
It's like, this is like Federal Express or DHL doing free shipping,

678
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,180
except for containers, for huge containers.

679
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:28,180
This really shows that there's some dire circumstances

680
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,180
and desperate situations going on.

681
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,180
Let me just check my email for a second.

682
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,180
I was, oh, man.

683
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,180
Oh, wow.

684
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,180
I was planning on that.

685
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,180
You know what? I'm going to do this right now.

686
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:46,180
I'm just planning on talking with Maggie from our office

687
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,180
and because she's going to the inauguration.

688
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,180
Now, Maggie is African-American and I don't want to say

689
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,180
exactly how old she is because that would be extremely rude.

690
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
But I sent her an email.

691
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,180
I said, you know, Maggie, you have such an amazing story,

692
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,180
which really starts with desegregation because,

693
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,180
okay, so I'm giving away part of her age.

694
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,180
I don't know, I'm just finding a number here for a second.

695
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,180
And, you know, even, I believe she's got like front row tickets

696
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,180
or something for the inauguration.

697
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,180
And even though I disagree with Obama and while the whole system

698
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,180
really, I thought she would have a very interesting story.

699
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,180
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to,

700
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,180
I'm going to have to put the talk she was going to have to go on

701
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,180
and hold, I think.

702
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,180
I don't think, can I start a conference?

703
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,180
Can I add another call to this?

704
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,180
Probably not.

705
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,180
Damn.

706
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,180
Because I want you guys to hear it and maybe even chime in.

707
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,180
Oh, if only I had a,

708
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:59,180
okay, I got to work on that.

709
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,180
Hold on, let me see if I can get a hold of Maggie.

710
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,180
Let me, uh, get her number here.

711
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,180
Uh, tell you what, I'm going to play a song and then I'll get her on the phone.

712
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,180
And we'll, uh, we'll finish the show with her.

713
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,180
It really, I think, I think you'll enjoy it.

714
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,180
It should be interesting.

715
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,180
By the way, the song that I'm going to play for you is such a beautiful tune.

716
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,180
It's the new one from Skinny.

717
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,180
You know, the guys from Holland.

718
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,180
But this is holiday.

719
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:30,180
But this is where we saved our money for all year.

720
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,180
So this is the sun.

721
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,180
This is a good, good life.

722
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:41,180
This is where everybody wants to be without their wives.

723
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:47,180
This is where I won't be flying.

724
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:52,180
I'll be on the moon on the moon.

725
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,180
Hallelujah.

726
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,180
I really got it made.

727
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:04,180
I got two cars on the driveway ready to take me anywhere.

728
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,180
Glory, glory.

729
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,180
Who wrote a beautiful place?

730
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,180
All the water and the mountains.

731
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,180
I want the people look the same.

732
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:21,180
This is where I won't be flying too.

733
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,180
My heart beats on the moon.

734
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,180
On the moon.

735
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,180
My heart beats on the moon.

736
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,180
On the moon.

737
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,180
You're a little bit submitted.

738
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,180
My heart feels like you're drunk.

739
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,180
I'm ready to leave this planet.

740
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,180
If I can find you here.

741
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,180
I look done every corner.

742
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:50,180
Every leaf I turn around.

743
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,180
Stop my engines.

744
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,180
I'm gonna leave this town.

745
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,180
I've been west.

746
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,180
I've been used.

747
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,180
I travel everywhere to find my news.

748
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,180
But the only place I found in

749
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,180
wasn't my news.

750
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,180
I woke up at the sun.

751
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,180
I lost everything before I reached the moon.

752
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,180
Now I'm still trying.

753
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,180
Getting over you.

754
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:24,180
And I know where I'll be flying too.

755
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:28,180
I go anywhere.

756
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,180
You're a little bit too.

757
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,180
My heart beats on the moon.

758
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,180
On the moon.

759
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,180
My heart beats on the moon.

760
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,180
On the moon.

761
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,180
On the moon.

762
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,180
On the moon.

763
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,180
On the moon.

764
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,180
My heart beats on the moon.

765
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,180
On the moon.

766
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,180
On the moon.

767
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,180
My heart beats on the moon.

768
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,180
16 needs a minute.

769
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,180
Easy like this summer sun.

770
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,180
On the moon.

771
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,180
I heart beats on the moon.

772
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,180
As the title, my heart beats on the moon.

773
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,180
It's skinny.

774
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,180
You know, from Mod Jones,

775
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,180
you can find all this shite.

776
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,180
It's skinny.

777
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,180
I know what a beautiful, beautiful song.

778
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,180
And I got to hold a Maggie's

779
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,180
and I'm going to see if I can call her.

780
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:29,180
I believe that it'll put the

781
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,180
a talk shoot client on hold.

782
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,180
But at least to me.

783
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,180
Morning.

784
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,180
Hey, Maggie.

785
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,180
Good morning.

786
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,180
How are you?

787
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,180
I'm fine.

788
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,180
Thank you.

789
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,180
We're already recording.

790
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,180
And I really appreciate you coming on the show.

791
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,180
Because I really just want to talk with you for five or ten minutes.

792
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,180
Because you have such an extraordinary story.

793
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,180
And I really appreciate taking the time.

794
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,180
Because you're actually your off today, right?

795
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,180
You're getting ready for your big trip.

796
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,180
Yes.

797
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,180
I am very much so.

798
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,180
So just to put into context,

799
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:01,180
Maggie is executive assistant to three of the biggest

800
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,180
egos in the world.

801
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,180
To myself.

802
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,180
To Ron Bloom and our CEO Jeff Carpe.

803
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,180
Is anyone else your executive assistant for Maggie?

804
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,180
Or did I summon up there?

805
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,180
Anybody that needs any assistant

806
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,180
from always willing to lend a hand?

807
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,180
So I've been really, I've been very considerate.

808
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,180
And I haven't mentioned your age,

809
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,180
although to put it in context,

810
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,180
you're a little bit older than I am.

811
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,180
Just a tad.

812
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,180
African American.

813
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,180
And would you born in the South Maggie?

814
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,180
No, born and raised in San Francisco, California.

815
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:39,180
Wow.

816
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,180
Somehow I thought you were from the South San Francisco.

817
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,180
Okay.

818
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,180
Would you mind my parents are from the South?

819
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,180
Right.

820
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,180
Okay.

821
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,180
That was it.

822
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,180
Now, let me just frame this up.

823
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,180
Maggie is a fantastic debater.

824
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,180
We love going at each other,

825
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:57,180
particularly when it comes to politics and policy.

826
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,180
And you got another line coming in?

827
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,180
No, that's okay.

828
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,180
All right.

829
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,180
If you got to pick it up, no problem.

830
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,180
No, that's okay.

831
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,180
They'll call me back.

832
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,180
All right.

833
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,180
We go back and forth.

834
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,180
But it's all in good fun.

835
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,180
And we get our emotions out.

836
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,180
And we yell on the screen.

837
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,180
But we enjoy that.

838
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,180
Right, Maggie?

839
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,180
You would have to say that.

840
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,180
Yes, we do.

841
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,180
Yeah.

842
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,180
Now, I enjoy it.

843
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,180
You're smart.

844
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,180
You're bright.

845
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,180
You're articulate.

846
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,180
It's always good.

847
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,180
But of course, I don't support.

848
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,180
Or I didn't support our President regardless.

849
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,180
Give him a fair shot.

850
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,180
I was, of course, an ardent, ardently against Obama.

851
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:44,180
And you are one of the largest, it was just most magnificent supporters of Obama.

852
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,180
I've ever met.

853
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:54,180
And I just wanted to understand a little bit about the story from your perspective.

854
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,180
Being African-American.

855
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,180
Being a little bit older than I am.

856
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,180
You literally witnessed desegregation.

857
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,180
Yes.

858
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,180
Can you tell me, and I don't know if you can put it into words.

859
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,180
But what has taken place now and what has about to happen?

860
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:12,180
Can you even describe how that feels for you?

861
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:16,180
Well, for me, it's just so phenomenal.

862
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:20,180
It's, and for most, I'm not going to say it only African-Americans.

863
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:24,180
But all people of color who are witnessed over the years,

864
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:30,180
the struggle, the hardship, the, I guess, just the overall,

865
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:36,180
of us becoming equal, it's so to speak.

866
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:45,180
In terms of Martin Luther King's, I mean, just that whole generation of civil rights leaders

867
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,180
and movements that we're going on.

868
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:52,180
And therefore quite a few before Martin Luther King came along quite a few leaders

869
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,180
that sort of paid the way in the 20s and the 30s.

870
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:02,180
But it became really, really important when Martin Luther King started fighting for the cause,

871
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,180
because it was televised.

872
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,180
It was on the radio.

873
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,180
You could see it.

874
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,180
You could hear it.

875
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,180
You could feel it.

876
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:12,180
Before the North and the South's were a little separated, we knew there was Jim Crow

877
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,180
in the South going on.

878
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:17,180
And most people who had migrated, migrated from the South, like my parents,

879
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:23,180
that came here in the late 30s, early 40s, to get away from that situation.

880
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:31,180
And just to see it unravel and unfold after 45 or 50 years, just to say, okay,

881
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:36,180
now that we have made it, because we've always been here, our contributions

882
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:40,180
to the overall history of this country have been phenomenal.

883
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,180
And you only hear about it during one month of year, and that's February.

884
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,180
Right.

885
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,180
Or when Chris Rock has a new DVD out.

886
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,180
Exactly.

887
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:52,180
I'll hear you going to get John and says something really ugly about it.

888
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,180
What's going on in the world?

889
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,180
I guess.

890
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,180
Go ahead.

891
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,180
I'm sorry.

892
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,180
Go ahead.

893
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,180
It's just the long, hard struggle at him.

894
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:10,180
And for this particular time in history, for this to happen, for this man of African and American

895
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:17,180
descent, to just hold for overwhelmingly went an election in this country.

896
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,180
I mean, it's beyond imagination.

897
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,180
I can understand that.

898
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,180
Was it the same feeling?

899
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,180
Because what you said there was really important Martin Luther King, because it was on television,

900
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,180
it was on the radio.

901
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,180
So here, you know, that was a huge step.

902
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:39,180
Is it the same type of feeling, do you think, with Obama now, where he is?

903
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,180
Oh, it is even more so.

904
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,180
You're talking about the dream.

905
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,180
Martin Luther King was the dreamer.

906
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,180
The dream has unfolded.

907
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:55,180
Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States of America, a man of color.

908
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,180
Did you ever think that would happen at it?

909
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:03,180
Well, you know, I grew up in Amsterdam, Maggie.

910
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:09,180
You know, so for me, it's, I don't see color really that way.

911
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:14,180
Or men or women, you know, because leaders in Europe,

912
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:17,180
have been many women, Margaret Thatcher.

913
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,180
Right now, Angela Merkel, you know, and no one ever, although the jury's out of

914
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,180
she's actually a woman.

915
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,180
But it's.

916
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:30,180
Because so that's a different, yeah, I would say that's, that's just a different environment.

917
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:36,180
But you and I have spoken many times about racism, and you feel the racism is still rampant in the United States.

918
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:39,180
It's still there.

919
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:45,180
It's, you know, and I, I don't want to say that, I don't, let me put it this way.

920
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:50,180
There is something awful and hidden in the United States.

921
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:54,180
Still, even though this man has been elected, even though he is a man of color,

922
01:06:54,180 --> 01:07:01,180
there is underlying, there's still underlying racism here in the United States.

923
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:06,180
It's just, it's kind of, you know, under the radar,

924
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:12,180
but there are still things that happen here, and you know that it's because of racism.

925
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:20,180
You know, albeit, we always say, no, no, that's not, that's not going on in the United.

926
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:25,180
But there are still parts of the United States where it's loud, and it's boisterous, and it's ugly.

927
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:32,180
And then their parts, our places in the United States where it's just that, you know, that little underlying thing going.

928
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,180
Right. Well, and there's also idiots everywhere, but I'll tell you, Maggie,

929
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,180
you know, I've lived in many different countries, and I was just talking about this the other day with my wife,

930
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:45,180
that I have never witnessed so much racism as in the United Kingdom to be, to be really honest with you.

931
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:51,180
And it's, you know, and it here, it's like right now, the, you know, I don't know if you heard this,

932
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:57,180
that Prince William, he had some videotape when he was with his army buddies from two years ago,

933
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:01,180
and it got released to the papers, and in that tape, he says, oh, there's that packie guy over there.

934
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:07,180
Oh, that, that's my buddy, the rag head, you know, kind of the way the way we talk, right, you know, kind of the way buddies talk,

935
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:12,180
and it's not such a big deal, because everything within context can be racist or not.

936
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,180
But what's funny is all these politicians are on television saying, well, this is so wrong,

937
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:21,180
and it's right that he apologized, blah, blah, blah, and meanwhile, I'll say,

938
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:27,180
how the amount of times I've heard from an Englishman, you know, like just a guy driving a cab saying,

939
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:32,180
I guess what color they were, and like, I'm shocked, I'm like, what did you just say?

940
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,180
You just say someone's action based upon their color.

941
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:40,180
Well, it's true, and like, oh, man, you know, so just so you know, Maggie, we could be doing a lot worse,

942
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,180
the United States.

943
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:46,180
We know, but it's, it's, it's, and see, you were offended.

944
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:48,180
So imagine.

945
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,180
Yeah.

946
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:54,180
The person that, that that remark is being, of course, thrown at, of course.

947
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,180
It's like, oh, just stabbed you in heart.

948
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,180
Yeah.

949
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:02,180
And these are the kinds of things that we were hoping with change here in this country.

950
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,180
You know, little by little, the barriers are breaking down, but it's still there.

951
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,180
And see, this is the 20th century.

952
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,180
We're supposed to be enlightened.

953
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,180
We're supposed to be above and beyond all of this.

954
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:15,180
Did it, that you rhetoric.

955
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:18,180
But it's still, in some places, it's still there.

956
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:23,180
And then it's like, you talk, you still, if you talk to most people,

957
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:28,180
then the city, San Francisco, which is the most diverse city, I think, in this country,

958
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,180
other than New York.

959
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:33,180
And there are still people who are saying, oh, wow.

960
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,180
The black man, Juan, do you?

961
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,180
Yeah.

962
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,180
And I'm like, yeah, sure, dude.

963
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,180
I love a feisty black woman, Maggie.

964
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,180
You know that.

965
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,180
Yeah.

966
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,180
I'm proud of who I am.

967
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:52,180
Again, you know, it comes from a long history of players in my family.

968
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:56,180
People who were involved, my dad, my grandparents.

969
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:00,180
It was a group during an after World War I.

970
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,180
My both grandfathers fought in World War I and they were both seven years.

971
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:11,180
And when they came home from World War I, they decided that they had to form a group

972
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,180
and they were called the Beaconies.

973
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,180
You know, they were churchgoers.

974
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,180
That's right.

975
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,180
That's right.

976
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:22,180
And they had to use this organization.

977
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:28,180
Fight off the racist, the racism in the South.

978
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,180
After they had fought in World War I.

979
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,180
But then you know, the story, World War I, World War II.

980
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,180
Disegregation in the Army, all kinds of stuff.

981
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,180
But you know, here we are.

982
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,180
We still have people, young men and women of color, who are fighting wars.

983
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:46,180
And that are, and when they come home, they are still being treated.

984
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,180
Like nonsense.

985
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,180
Yes, yes.

986
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:52,180
In fact, 25% of San Francisco's homeless are veterans, which is just disgusting.

987
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,180
Yes, they are.

988
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:54,180
Absolutely disgusting.

989
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,180
That hurts me to that hurts me to the core.

990
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:01,180
Every time I see one on the corner, you have to sign saying, I'm a be let.

991
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,180
Now I'm back.

992
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,180
I have to stop.

993
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,180
Take out my wallet and say, you know, this is what I have.

994
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,180
And you can have it because you made a great sacrifice for us.

995
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,180
Yeah.

996
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,180
Now I'm, I'm for, you know, my background, my family.

997
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,180
So yeah, I'm very much the same way.

998
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:20,180
Maggie, I just like to get into the inauguration because you are not only going to DC,

999
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,180
you're going to be front row and center.

1000
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,180
How did you manage that?

1001
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,180
How did that come about?

1002
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:31,180
Well, what happened was my girlfriend, her name is Deborah McIntyre.

1003
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:36,180
She belongs to, she's a constituent of Alameda County.

1004
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:40,180
So her congressman, George Miller, put on a lottery.

1005
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:43,180
So he, you know, 34 tickets into the ring.

1006
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,180
He said, if you want to try for these inauguration tickets,

1007
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,180
you'll have to go online, sign up, get out of Yada.

1008
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:53,180
Okay, I think there was something like 2,000 people that went online

1009
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:57,180
to sign up and try when these tickets, a lot of tickets.

1010
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:02,180
So she said, you know what, Maggie, I'm just going to do it for the hell of it.

1011
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,180
I said, okay, you know, you know, we're hurt.

1012
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:09,180
And they called her a couple of weeks later and told her that she could

1013
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,180
want two of the tickets.

1014
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:17,180
So she called me and she said, you will not believe this just a woman.

1015
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,180
I said, what's up?

1016
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:22,180
She said, I want two lottery tickets.

1017
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:25,180
And I said, oh my God, that you like.

1018
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,180
She said, no, I'm not Maggie.

1019
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,180
She said, we are in Washington DC.

1020
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,180
I said, yes, we are.

1021
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:36,180
So we have been planning ever since we tried to get really cheap airfares.

1022
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,180
We couldn't do that.

1023
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,180
We tried to get a whole scale.

1024
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,180
We finally had to go through a broker to get a whole scale.

1025
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,180
Oh wow.

1026
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,180
Yeah, we would do it.

1027
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,180
You know, I could have gotten you.

1028
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,180
I could have gotten you.

1029
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,180
I could have gotten you a really cheap ticket.

1030
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:52,180
At least to the Hudson, maybe not to the airport.

1031
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,180
But I could have gotten most of the way.

1032
01:12:55,180 --> 01:13:00,180
I would have had to pick the answer.

1033
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:05,180
Well, Maggie, that couldn't have happened to a more deserving and nicer person.

1034
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,180
Yeah.

1035
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,180
And you know, we will, I'm coming out the end of the month.

1036
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:12,180
And of course, undoubtedly, I'll have plenty to say about the policies of the president.

1037
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:17,180
But a true American tradition, we support our president no matter who you voted for.

1038
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,180
And we give him the benefit of the doubt.

1039
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:21,180
And I am going to uphold that tradition.

1040
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:26,180
But you know that I'm pretty skeptical that he is actually lying to you.

1041
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,180
No, you're skeptical, but that's all right.

1042
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,180
You're a good guy anyway.

1043
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:31,180
But you don't think keep this in mind.

1044
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:37,180
There are people, you know, there were people who were saying, yeah, no experience or experience.

1045
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:43,180
I don't any American president in the history of this country had any experience when they went into the office.

1046
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:51,180
And one of our greatest is that if we are, and I mean, even Lincoln did not have the experience that he needed.

1047
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:59,180
As these two men, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano wrote to those words, two of the greatest presidents that we've ever had in this country.

1048
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:05,180
And we're going to add a rock Obama's name to that list because he's going to make a change here.

1049
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,180
Because we all want that change.

1050
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:12,180
And you have your country behind you saying, you know, rock, Obama.

1051
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,180
We are with you 100% we know it's going to.

1052
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,180
It's not going to be easy.

1053
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:20,180
It's going to be a lot hard road to tell.

1054
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,180
But we're going to be with you.

1055
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,180
No matter what happens.

1056
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:27,180
Well, Maggie, I'm right there with you.

1057
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:35,180
And I, you know, well, I totally agree that if the country can all get together and say, hey, we're in it.

1058
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,180
We want to do something good.

1059
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,180
We want to make this this change happen.

1060
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:44,180
You know, that type, the, the, the public is always much greater than any of the leaders out there or any force.

1061
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,180
So that, that would be truly amazing.

1062
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:51,180
But the, the also have to have the courage to stand up when, when was wrong is wrong.

1063
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,180
So we'll see how that goes in the future.

1064
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:58,180
But again, Maggie, I hope you have a great time.

1065
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,180
Please take lots of pictures.

1066
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:02,180
And don't worry.

1067
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:05,180
I am going to, I am going to be the cleanest pictures.

1068
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:07,180
You know, I'm going to be in everybody's face.

1069
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,180
Well, and finally, what are you going to be wearing, Maggie? Come on.

1070
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,180
What are you putting on?

1071
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:17,180
Oh, I have, I have already packed six of the most fabulous ball gowns that I have.

1072
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,180
I don't you have like some hot little little number.

1073
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,180
You got something sexy.

1074
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:26,180
I have some hot, I have some, I have some passion for the behind.

1075
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:30,180
Okay, I can say, I have some here, but I've got some passion for them.

1076
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,180
I have pulled out some vintage dresses that I haven't worn in years.

1077
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,180
I'm fabulous ball gowns.

1078
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,180
Cocktail dresses just, you know, my husband told me, do you know what?

1079
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:43,180
He said, yes, she's going to be an inaugurationer.

1080
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,180
You're just going to party though.

1081
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:48,180
Yes, and yes, that would be the answer.

1082
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,180
I don't know if I'm like that.

1083
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,180
I'm sure he'll be fine.

1084
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:56,180
Maggie, thank you so much for taking time. Have a great time.

1085
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,180
I can understand this is just going to be so exhilarating.

1086
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,180
And we'll talk to you.

1087
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,180
I'll talk to you when I get out to San Francisco in a couple weeks.

1088
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:08,180
Okay, and I'm hoping to just be able to stand after the stamina.

1089
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,180
You know, that a personal no dose.

1090
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,180
So I think I'm going to be able to hang.

1091
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,180
I'm sure you'll have no problem whatsoever.

1092
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,180
I've seen you hang with the best of them.

1093
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,180
All right, man.

1094
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,180
Yeah. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye now.

1095
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,180
Bye-bye now.

1096
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,180
Maggie Bishop, everybody, from Niveo.

1097
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,180
And this is a little poll anchor to wrap it up.

1098
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,180
Good thing I guess.

1099
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:41,180
Because one could say, she's got the eye of the tire.

1100
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,180
Rising up.

1101
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,180
Back on the street.

1102
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,180
Did but time took chances.

1103
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,180
I went the distance now and back on my feet.

1104
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:57,180
Just a man with the will to survive.

1105
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,180
And many times, it happened too fast.

1106
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:05,180
You changed your passion for the glory.

1107
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:08,180
Don't lose your grip.

1108
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:11,180
On dreams of the past, you got to fight.

1109
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:13,180
To keep them alive.

1110
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,180
Gifts the eye of a tiger.

1111
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,180
Dream out of fight.

1112
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,180
Rising up.

1113
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,180
To challenge a rival.

1114
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:29,180
The last notes of I ever stalked spring in the night.

1115
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:34,180
Watching us all of the eye.

1116
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,180
Of the title.

1117
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:40,180
The eyes of my heart.

1118
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:47,180
Place the face out in the night.

1119
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:51,180
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry.

1120
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:55,180
�sterically, on still we take him to the street.

1121
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:58,180
We kill with the skill to survive.

1122
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:04,180
Yes, this is the eye of the tiger.

1123
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:10,180
The climate of white rising up to challenge a rival

1124
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:15,180
And it's the last known survival stops in the night

1125
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:20,180
Watching us all in the eye

1126

The title

1156
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:28,180
Rising up straight to the top, I got the guts, got the glory, I went to Disney's not gonna stop, just a man with a will to survive.

1157
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:38,180
Hey guys, it's the eye of the tiger, it's the premon of fight, rising up to challenge a rival.

1158
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:48,180
It's the last known survival, stopping prey in the night, watching us all in the eye.

1159
01:19:48,180 --> 01:20:17,940
And thanks to Maggie Bishop from the video for giving me her perspective on life and

1160
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:21,940
I was beautiful, it was a beautiful story.

1161
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,940
Of course, I could have shit all over her, but I'll do that at the end of the week.

1162
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:29,940
At the end of the month, I go out and we'll go yell and scream to each other, which that one I also want to record.

1163
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:34,940
And I know she'll do it too, but this is really what a great feeling she must have.

1164
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,940
So I didn't want to harsh her mellow, I'm sure you understand.

1165
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:44,940
And I'm sorry everybody on TalkShoot, there was absolutely no way I could figure out how to add that call into the TalkShoot

1166
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,940
and a Skype puts it on a hold and all this crap going on.

1167
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,940
So I have to work on that, I have to fix that.

1168
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,940
I got some time coming up pretty soon, so I'll be able to.

1169
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:58,940
All right, that's it for 817, the Fubar Friday edition ran a little bit longer than I expected to.

1170
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,940
Our in 20 minutes.

1171
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:13,940
For those of you who are in the United Kingdom, but look for demonstrations in your local time zone to stop this heinous war taking place in the Gaza strip.

1172
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:23,940
Tomorrow at Trafalgar Square is where people will be meeting for the London protests and I'll definitely be a part of that with the kids.

1173
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:28,940
And in closing besides the fact that you have to be very, very careful of your freedom while you still have it and use it wisely.

1174
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:33,940
And I do want you to live your life with passion, but this new one I think is really summon it up for me.

1175
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,940
Ask not what you can do for your country.

1176
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:39,940
Ask what your government is doing to you.

1177
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,940
Another fine, medial presentation.

1178
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,940
Stick it in your ear.
