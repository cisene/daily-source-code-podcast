00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, good morning, everybody, and welcome to the Daily Source Code.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,320
Thank you very much for taking the time to download this mp3 file, or if some of you

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,680
may have received it automatically overnight as an enclosure in your aggregator.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,920
In that case, thanks for subscribing.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,380
The first, what I'd like to do is explain exactly what this is, what the Daily Source

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,320
Code is going to be, and well, as the name already suggests, it's something that's

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,500
going to be daily.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,480
And I'd like to elaborate a little bit on the name Daily Source Code and what inspired

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
me to do this, where that came from.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,740
By the way, I'm recording this in my car.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:51,220
I'm on the way from our home in Belgium to Breda in the Netherlands.

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,980
Pick up new pair of glasses and contact with...

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,980
Oops.

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,020
It's a very important carriage.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,860
I think I'm going to have to take another route.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,540
Anyway, the Daily Source Code.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,780
Let me back up here for a second.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,860
I'm in a very narrow country lane and there's a horse and drawn carriage coming my way.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,660
So you know what?

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,100
I'm going to just step over here and while I'm talking to you guys, I'll just wait for

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,460
this guy to pass.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,700
When I was on vacation just recently in Sorrento, Italy, a couple of great things happened.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,380
First of all, as if by magic, my wireless microphone, which I had lost for a few months,

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,980
I had the receiver apart but I just couldn't find the microphone part.

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,580
It was left over from our reality show that we taped over a year ago and I bought a couple

26
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,540
of really professional wireless mic kits.

27
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,300
It cost about $2,000 each.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,660
So this is great, has great range and has a great sound.

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,980
It's just fantastic.

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,140
Professional stuff.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,320
So I found that in a suitcase that had been lurking there apparently for a couple of months

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,340
I thought, well, alright, now I can finally start doing some audio blogging again.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But also, I'd loaded up my iPod.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You may or may not know that I have created a couple of scripts that

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
parse some RSS feeds with enclosures and automatically downloads

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the MP3 files and adds them to my iTunes library and to my iPod.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm subscribed to the IT conversations feed.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And so I loaded that up.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wave to this guy here. Sure, buddy. Happy to do it.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I loaded it up.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And on there was a couple of conferences or a couple of sessions

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
from the open source developers conference, I believe.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I forgot who the speaker was.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Of course, I'll be sure to find out and link to him.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I was talking about what source code really is.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Is source code the actual script that runs that makes your computer

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
do something or the machine code that sits underneath all that?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or is the source code perhaps?

49
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,500
actually the written explanation, the English explanation, not just funky English that a computer can interpret,

50
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
that explains what a program is supposed to do.

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:24,500
And I kind of subscribe to that idea that maybe even an RFC or just a functional description of,

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
okay, here's what I want this computer program to do, here's how it should behave.

53
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,500
That is the actual source code, it's the thought behind what eventually gets written in computer code or scripting language.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:44,500
So if you think about a radio program or an audio program like this, you could, coincidentally, it's also called a program, right?

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I guess you could say that this is the source code to me.

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
It's Adam's source code.

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,500
And every single day, a bit of me is filtered through to the web, and I write about what I'm thinking, what I've been reading.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,500
You know, the links that I choose, the sites that I choose to link to, all that comes from a certain mindset on the website.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,800
on any given day or moment, and that's what I call the source code.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:17,040
So I figured if I have a web log and I've got all these links and stories, it might

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,320
be of some interest to some people to listen to the source code where all the ideas come

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
from.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
The narrative that's running around in my head that I can't possibly write down.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,080
other inspiration has been Dave Weiner, who started doing his morning coffee notes in

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,220
audio a while ago, and he did almost a daily version during the blogging of the Democratic

66
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:51,040
National Convention. And I'm addicted to it. I just love listening to his source code, basically.

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,680
And his latest coffee notes, which he actually pleaded people to listen to, he made a very

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,480
good point, which he and I have discussed before, and I think I've written about it

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:10,680
on the web as well, is that we're coming to a head between bloggers and journalists.

70
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,880
And it's all really about, on a second, in Belgium here we stop at the, we stop for

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
pedestrians. Sure, man.

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,260
recollect my thoughts here for a second.

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,420
I didn't want to hit anybody.

74
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,180
This is kind of tough.

75
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,180
Hold on, let me just spark up.

76
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,820
About a half hour drive-out.

77
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm trying to make this 15 minutes

78
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,140
So at any rate

79
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,220
The big

80
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,620
Revelation really of the promise of the web which they've says I think correctly is not necessarily web logs

81
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,420
It's the fact that when you write something you can link to the source

82
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,220
so

83
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,860
If you interpreted something that someone wrote in a certain way and you have an opinion about it

84
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,440
You can write that and then kind of the unwritten rule is you link to the source and then people can

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,680
Form their own opinion and agree or disagree with you

86
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,500
that's one of the beauties of the web and

87
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,880
It doesn't work that way in traditional journalism because there is just no way to link in a radio show or

88
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:21,200
Television show or certainly not in a print publication. Well, I guess you could print a URL

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,040
But it's not quite the same it doesn't give your readers the same immediate access to check out the source

90
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,220
And I was listening to that and I was thinking, you know, wow, that's so true.

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,020
interview so many times, particularly in the Netherlands where my wife and I are very well

92
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,820
known and are written about all the time in, unfortunately, usually just a tabloid magazine.

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,700
Sometimes there's a serious article, but it really doesn't matter who's writing it or who

94
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,980
did the interview or what credentials the journalist comes with. Once you read it in print, it's never

95
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:02,380
100% what you intended or the way you said it and it often has, it's often opinionated by the

96
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,180
journalist, the writer, which is obviously okay, but there's no link to the source. The sources,

97
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,220
in that case, would be the conversation that we had for the interview, which could be anywhere

98
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,660
from half hour on the phone to, oh, I've had interviews, for instance, the big Playboy magazine

99
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:25,260
interview that takes two days, including a photo session. And that's still down to X number of words

100
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,380
that the journalist has allotted and the space that is available for the story.

101
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,980
It's a deer.

102
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Thanks for watching!

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,280
So as I was thinking about that, there was something that I wanted to write about, which

104
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,560
I will, but again, this is just my daily source code, so I'm kind of distilling through the

105
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
thoughts right now.

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,280
I found something that was really useful.

107
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,000
I got so sick and tired of people just writing crap about us and wrong information and just

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,400
you know, they couldn't even get my age right most of the time.

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,080
Which usually was to my advantage.

110
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,600
I remember there was a, at a certain point, there was a big thing and someone wrote about

111
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,560
some supposed tax inquiry that was going on into my business affairs.

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,880
That was on the front page of several newspapers, another newspapers, you know, pick up the

113
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,640
story and it was on the news wires and all the actual errors would just pass from one

114
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,000
to the next, like the kids' game of telephone.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,440
In fact, they usually got a little bit worse as one publication copied another.

116
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,480
And there was another large daily.

117
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,880
the newspaper that said, well, we really want to interview you and your wife about what's

118
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,020
going on and what's happening. I said, you know, that's fine. Are you guys going to

119
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,620
record the interview? It was for the newspaper. So a lot of, I'd say eight out of ten journalists

120
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,620
record their interviews on usually still on a cassette player, portable cassette player.

121
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,700
Some good little funky and have a new fast, new fangled gadgets like maybe a mini-disk,

122
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:10,700
but very few MP3 recorders out there. Really just more memo recording devices. And I said,

123
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,660
well, yeah, of course we're going to say, well, you know what, I'm going to record

124
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:22,540
our interview as well. And I'm going to reserve the right to publish that. And that was something

125
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,100
new. They agreed to it, which I think was absolutely the right thing to do. But they

126
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,460
were definitely a little bit freaked out about this new concept. But I mean, when you think

127
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,180
about it, hey, you know, you're recording me, what gives you the right to be the only one?

128
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,020
I mean, I should be able to record our conversation.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,120
to. And I figured that that way if they start printing all kinds of factual, incorrect bits,

130
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,120
or maybe even if they just interpreted it incorrectly, I would be able to point to the

131
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,720
source, the source code of that interview and say, here you go. These guys clearly misunderstood

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,320
me or they took this out of context. And I have to add something that also happens is

133
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,560
I may have explained it poorly. I may have not communicated something that in a certain

134
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,000
way and that just came out wrong. That happens probably most frequently. One second buddy,

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,560
you want to move in here? Wow, doing this in the car really makes me a very nice and

136
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:34,640
courteous road user. Okay, this is the big trash truck. All right, Val. When the article

137
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,880
came out, by the way, and most generally, well, not most, but many journalists will give you

138
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,300
read the story before it's printed and change anything. And said, you know, they did ask

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,020
a couple follow up questions over the phone later. And the article was good. And I don't

140
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,260
believe there was, I mean, you can't really change any article sound the way you want

141
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,420
it to sound. But when it comes to the facts, these guys are really on their toes. They

142
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,900
had recorded themselves and it was two guys did the interview. And it came out very well.

143
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,100
And I think that part of that was because they knew that they really had to be on their

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,820
toes and get it right because I would publish the source code. I never actually did publish

145
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,580
the source code. I still have it. I felt that, you know, that just wasn't necessary. And

146
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:30,140
in fact, just the idea that I could worked. So when you think about it that way, which

147
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:41,600
is a great way that journalists and their sources can work together to make better to

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
better results. Something that everyone who is ever interviewed might want to consider

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,520
doing. So I just flipped that around and said, well, hold on a second.

150
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,940
I've got source code.

151
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,980
The source code is what's running around in my head.

152
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,860
And it's what I'm reading and what I'm linking to and what my thoughts are.

153
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,340
And I should make that available.

154
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,980
The only thing that's going to cost is what just bandwidth.

155
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,780
I mean, I have so much time to record stuff.

156
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,580
I mean, the car a lot.

157
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
But it's really no effort.

158
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,900
And of course, I'm going to...

159
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,580
And it gives me another opportunity to write a couple of nifty scripts that automates the

160
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:26,660
whole bit and does the ID3 tags and posts it to the right place and adds it to my RSS

161
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
feed as an enclosure.

162
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,780
So all of that, of course, is the fun part for me is a fledgling developer and program

163
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,140
or maybe I should say a scriptor.

164
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,300
But again, you get all the source code for me if you're interested in it and you don't

165
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,900
have to listen to it at all.

166
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,900
You won't really lose it.

167
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,500
So another reason that I'm doing this and I do plan on it being daily is that I like doing

168
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,660
audio or radio.

169
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,020
I've been doing a morning radio program.

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,160
for almost a full year as of August 31st. I've done it for a full year for

171
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,400
Radio Veronica in the Netherlands who asked me about a year ago this this time

172
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,920
if I could fill in for a month because their new morning guy could get of his

173
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,320
contract at a competing radio station and I can't even when they ask me

174
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,920
damn you know a month of getting up at 3.30 in the morning to do a show from 6 to 9

175
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,800
I don't know if I last three days the month went okay and I really got into it

176
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,920
and I was enjoying it and a morning show is it's kind of like this you know

177
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,760
you're talking to people you're helping them wake up and talking about topical

178
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,160
stuff it's just what's going on in the world what's going on in the

179
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,800
community which is the country of the Netherlands and I guess the community

180
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,680
is a global community so you can talk about all kinds of stuff and we had a

181
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,840
great time on that show I mean we took the ratings up sky-high actually in just

182
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,680
a couple of months by

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,000
taking the entire show on the road for a week and broadcast live from Camp Smitty and Asamawa, Iraq,

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,500
where the Dutch Marines were stationed.

185
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
And it was just a blast, you know.

186
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
And really it's just talking and playing a little bit of music.

187
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
So that ends.

188
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Oh, well, so the morning guy for a number of personal reasons couldn't make it to the station,

189
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,500
and they kept saying, well, oh, the station management kept asking me to extend by another week

190
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
or another month.

191
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I said, well, you know what, why don't we just say we'll do this for a whole year,

192
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
so I can actually build something and create something.

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
And that's my traffic alert. Check this out.

194
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Very in navel, direct restoque es tar fesperz.

195
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Travo glan zam rifin a tarpo d'imitin van ai dresou van vediam.

196
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
D'imitin van ai d'imitin van ai d'imitin.

197
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Okay, that's a traffic report cut and it happens automatically on radio.

198
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
So we did it for a full year and that's winding down two more weeks.

199
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
So a little bit over.

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,440
Yeah, a little over two weeks and then I'll be a free man for September 1st and Patricia

201
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,640
and I and our daughter Christina who's coming 14 in just a week and a half. We decided that

202
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,440
we want to change. Part of it for health reasons. Trish was diagnosed with heart disease earlier

203
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:25,400
this year. Not as horrible perhaps as it sounds, but easy for me to say I guess. But it's not like

204
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,520
she has massive heart failure heart disease but she has to pay attention to her life and

205
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:39,400
what she's doing and is on medication and has to keep a very healthy lifestyle. And we want to

206
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,640
change to really get into that and so we've decided that we're going to move and we're going to move

207
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:55,960
out of the the Benalux and we've picked the United Kingdom. So we've put our our both houses up for

208
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,360
sale the one in Amsterdam which I affectionately call the

209
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,780
that's actually been on the market for about two and a half, almost three years now.

210
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,920
The market is completely dead in most of Europe, I guess, and certainly for big luxury

211
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
houses.

212
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,100
There's just, ah, there's no buyers really, unless of course you're willing to lower

213
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,860
your price, there's always a buyer for something if they're bottom-feeding.

214
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,180
We have the Castle in Belgium, which you've now put on the market.

215
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,460
I've already had a lot of interest for that, of course it was also really the set, if you

216
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,340
will, for our reality show.

217
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:40,200
So a lot of people are familiar with it and we're pretty hopeful that that'll move relatively

218
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
quickly.

219
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,020
Price to sell, as they say, great house for entertaining everybody.

220
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,540
And then we're off and then we're going to go to the UK.

221
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,140
We're not, well, we know the general area where we want to be, which will be south of

222
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:58,820
London, but within a reasonable car or train ride into the city.

223
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,940
And I

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,720
a totally open agenda. There's nothing that I have to do. Well, first I want to remember

225
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,800
what it's like to sleep in. You know, not have to set the alarm clock for 3.30 in the

226
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,720
morning. But just by saying we're going to make this change, already things have happened.

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm getting all kinds of new, fresh, creative ideas. In addition, I've been asked to write

228
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,120
a book. All kinds of things are just coming together. So I'm really looking forward to

229
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,400
that in a way. It feels like I'm getting my freedom back. The one thing I do want to

230
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,560
try to do is to do these daily source code, audio, blog posts. And I guess it would be

231
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,840
since they're in English and to have an excellent advantage as a time difference goes. I'm going

232
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,400
to try and have these up by, I guess, 7 a.m. New York time. So if you're driving to work

233
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,220
and you have your download or automatically downloading the

234
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
The MP3's from the RSS feed.

235
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You'll have something to listen to on your morning commute.

236
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
That probably really won't be possible until the first of September when I'm not doing

237
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
the morning show.

238
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I just can't see getting, you know, being done on the morning show at night in the

239
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
morning, my time.

240
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,500
I'm usually not home before to, you know, only give me a very small window before,

241
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
well, actually that would already be too late.

242
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
That would be 8 a.m. New York time.

243
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,500
So these will probably be up around 9 or 10 a.m.

244
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
for the couple of weeks, first couple of weeks.

245
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
It also gives me a chance to figure out what I want to do with them.

246
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
One of the thoughts I had for instance was to do a song of the day.

247
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Just get you going with one song that I think either fits in with the mood of the day

248
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,500
or the news of the day or the state of the world or state of affairs.

249
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
So I'm looking forward to that.

250
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
And again, it'll be what's going on in my mind.

251
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
What am I thinking about?

252
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And by that time, I probably posted five to eight entries on my web blog.

253
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And this will be the source code for that, what I was thinking about.

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Which is pretty much on par for what I've posted today.

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So that's the general idea.

256
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Um...

257
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
As you can tell, there's a lot of talk of RSS and enclosures and MP3s in this first daily source code.

258
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You may or may not have read that I've been programming a little bit, been working in user talk,

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
which is scripting language that comes with Frontier and Radio User Land,

260
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and also been doing some work in Apple Script,

261
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
which allows you to script your Macintosh to do things automatically.

262
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And a little bit of Python, although I haven't delved into that as much as I want to.

263
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But I'm really working on a system that'll make this a little bit simpler when it comes to downloading stuff under your iPod.

264
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I have a kind of a beta version running now, and I'm subscribed to a big file.

265
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
One is the IT conversations, which is great because almost every day there's a new interview or panel or session coming up.

266
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,740
down the pipe and it's right there my iPod in the morning on my hour-long commute to

267
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,140
the radio station. I just listen, you know, I didn't have to do anything, I didn't have

268
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,900
to click or wait, just pick up the iPod in the morning, throw the headphones on, the earphones

269
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:45,660
in and there's something there. Also, of course Dave's morning coffee notes is in there and

270
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,540
something called blog, was it audio digger or blog digger? I'd have to look that up, which

271
00:20:50,540 --> 00:21:00,460
is an RSS 2.0 feed with audio enclosures. It comes from blog decks and it's just stuff

272
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,340
that it's scraped off of the web and there's about 5 to 10 new MP3s on that as well. It's

273
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:13,500
always very surprising, all kinds of wacky stuff that just kind of shows up. Total serendipity,

274
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,700
if you will. I have no idea what's going to show up. A lot of it's crap, someone's very,

275
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:26,180
very interesting. So I'll start pointing to that as well. So the script that I've created,

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,080
doesn't work the way it should yet and I already lost that source code by

277
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,120
accidentally compiling it in AppleScript and not knowing that you lose your source code.

278
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,520
But I'm going to start working on that again in in the also after September 1st

279
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,360
so that you know you don't have to really think about oh how am I going to do this

280
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,880
what do I need with the news aggregator how do I get

281
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,040
the mp3s from point A to point B now it should just be something as simple as

282
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,400
start this program up and you subscribe to your RSS feeds and it kind of does the rest

283
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,920
it just drops everything on your iPod and playlists and it even has a

284
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:13,360
little notification system so you know when something is new has been updated.

285
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,440
So I'm now just passing over the border into the Netherlands from Belgium. Thank you for accompanying me on the trip and

286
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,600
Tomorrow, I'll be back with another daily source code. Thanks for listening and see you tomorrow. Bye
