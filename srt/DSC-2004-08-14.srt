1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:20,460
Hi everybody and welcome to today's source code. That's Jesse, my dog, saying hi as well.

2
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,500
On a second. Well, I got to start off with a gripe right off the top. I've spent hours

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
today trying to find software that will do what I wanted to do to record these shows.

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
I'm sorry, go ahead.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,500
And it wasn't easy searching the web today because we had not one but two different families

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
come to check out the house, see if they want to buy it.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Which, you know, it's kind of crazy. Anyway, so I mean, I've been looking around and there's

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,500
plenty of software if you want to stream stuff live to a shout-cast server or live 365.

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:02,500
But nothing, excuse me, that actually includes the ability to mix more than one of those

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,640
to MP3s together and to also have a microphone channel, at least not for Macintosh. So if

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,120
anyone has any ideas, love to hear about them. Let's see. Well, yeah, because one of the main

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,800
reasons actually that want to have that type of a setup is, you know, for stuff like a

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,000
song of the day. I've done some experimenting with keep holding the mic up to the speaker,

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,160
but it sucks. Yeah, if I'm going to put songs on, then might as well sound good, or at least

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:45,720
halfway decent. One to just stop briefly and think for a second about Julia Child, who

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,120
passed away yesterday, age 91, which I, it's a nice age actually, I guess, if, you know,

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,320
but she's one of these people that's been around for just, you know, forever for generations.

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,720
I remember as a kid living in Kensington, Maryland, Julia Child came to cook at the local,

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,160
I think it was the high school.

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,500
and you can hire pleasant view high or something like that.

21
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,340
And, yes, she cooked up a big, big batch of spaghetti and meatballs and families.

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,380
I could, you know, for a couple dollars ahead go eat there.

23
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,340
And I remember distinctly the food was really good, although a bit lukewarm by the time

24
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
we got ours.

25
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,700
I remember my parents were like a little bit tense.

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,060
They were a little bit tense about the service, which of course was done by high school kids.

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,380
So people who came in after us were served before us.

28
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,820
Anyway, but it was good.

29
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,820
I do remember that.

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,180
And I actually found a Julia child quote and she had a lot of really good ones through

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,660
the blog digger enclosure feed.

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,140
Check this out.

33
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,820
Now, hold on a second.

34
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,060
See, this is why I need good software to do this for me.

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,620
Okay, here's that quote again.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,640
Just boil it in a big pot of scone

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,120
Just boil it in a big pot of scone

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,760
See other things I sometimes caught my eye was a Paris Hilton

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,200
Her dogs gone missing her her was a pet chihuahua

40
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,760
I gotta say I really like the Paris Hilton reality show the one she does with Nicole Ritchie

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,200
Even though it's not officially being broadcast in Europe yet. I don't know maybe it's gonna start in September

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,400
I've I've seen the entire first season and I'm up to almost up to speed on the second season

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,720
because of the bit torrent feeds and able to

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,400
Download an episode well maybe two or three days after it's been aired

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,120
and I'm using

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
This great program called nucleus. I've linked to it before

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,400
it's basically it's a little Python application script and

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,040
I have it sitting on the

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,860
server at my data center and it has keywords and it can only it's it's pretty

50
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,220
rudimentary but so it can only read one RSS feed and it looks for keywords which

51
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,620
are just basic search terms so I've got in their simple life growing up Gody

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:35,860
which is a new show that I just started just started watching. Hi Christina.

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
That's my daughter Christina.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,680
He's going to use the other computer, so I'll just walk outside to talk for a second to

55
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
you guys.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
So back to the keywords.

57
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,160
It's really great because it just sits there, it parses through this big RSS file that comes

58
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,960
in and it's updated very regularly.

59
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,320
The TV torrents.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,360
And when it catches one of those keywords, it downloads it.

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,000
So of course I'm also getting some serendipitous content.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Not everything that has the keywords simple and life in the title is Paris Hilton's reality

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,760
show.

64
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,840
And then once it's in there, I get notified and then at my convenience I just download,

65
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,040
batch download, all the new files which is a pretty fast link.

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,280
And that way it saves me a lot of hassle and the aggregation is 24 hours.

67
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
So basically it's the last yard.

68
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,560
It's on my server just not at the house yet.

69
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,400
And what I really like about Nucleus is that it doesn't leave your torrent files open.

70
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,800
So it just sucks it in and of course while it's downloading a file and it doesn't one

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,300
at a time which also helps on flooding the pipes.

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,300
It is uploading but once it's done it's done and then it goes on to the next torrent.

73
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,380
Because last night I downloaded a torrent here which is a 250 meg torrent file and this morning

74
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,500
when I woke up I had pushed out over 750 megs and like you know that was more than I thought

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,060
I had to offer it and not that I would mind about the cost or anything but I literally

76
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,200
can't buy more upstream than with from my ISP here in Belgium.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Well, I'm just gonna take a look at my notes for a second.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,640
Right.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,680
So that's one final thing.

80
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,960
Last night, watched the Olympics, the opening ceremony,

81
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,400
which was prime time here in Europe.

82
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,720
And I thought that the Greek did a pretty good job.

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,320
Their opening show wasn't as made for TV

84
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,160
as it was, for instance, in Los Angeles or Sydney.

85
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,560
But the show definitely was good.

86
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,400
And water is always hard to do on television

87
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,640
to make it look really spectacular.

88
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,000
What I thought was, well, first of all, there was DJ Chiesto,

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,280
who was our pride and joy in the Netherlands.

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,920
He was spinning all the dance music

91
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,040
during the presentation of all of the athletes

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,400
from all the countries as they walk around the track

93
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,840
and then collected into the center.

94
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
That was so very cool seeing him.

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,640
He's been voted top DJ of the world

96
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,960
for the, I think, the past three years, consecutively.

97
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,680
What caught my eye is that the number of video cameras

98
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,780
cameras and digital still cameras but the athletes who were being presented the crowd

99
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,980
carried with them was like wow that I'd love to see some of that footage or some of those

100
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,580
pictures and you know we have all the bits we could connect them all together. I'm presuming

101
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,060
that they have some kind of internet access in the in what is it in the Olympic Village

102
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,060
but maybe they even have Wi-Fi I don't know but it should be just as simple as plugging

103
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:14,940
your camera into your laptop and basically saying broadcast this. And I think there's

104
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,860
two sides to that equation and I'm trying to fix the first side just working on it in

105
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:30,060
audio to make the iPod more than just something that you sync to iTunes. I want your iPod

106
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,540
to be a receiver in a way where you put it in its cradle to charge and it loads it up

107
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,580
with new audio from the web.

108
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
and that's it.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,840
And it should be seamless.

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
You don't have to think about it and it should let you know.

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,240
And it should, you know, that it's done that and it put it

112
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,920
into a perfect playlist.

113
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,880
And I've been hacking around with that, which is pretty easy,

114
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,400
well, relatively easy on the Mac because it's already

115
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,760
kind of meant to work together.

116
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,000
So I'm going to continue working on that and release the script

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,760
or code or whatever you want to call it and who knows,

118
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,920
maybe folks will make it work for Windows.

119
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
And then, of course, is the other side to the equation,

120
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,200
which is how do you make it simple for people to broadcast that?

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,560
Is it as simple as maybe creating an on the go playlist

122
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,400
on your iPod?

123
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,120
And when you put it back into its charging stand,

124
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,960
it looks at that playlist and turns it into an RSS 2.0 feed

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,400
with enclosures.

126
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,440
And maybe the enclosures are torrent files.

127
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,080
I don't know.

128
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,480
Well, I guess I don't have to know because this is source code, right? This is just stuff running through my brain

129
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,020
I was a little more discombobulated than I wanted.

130
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,760
Ahh...

131
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
No, that's about it.

132
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm gonna walk out one more time.

133
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
It's weird.

134
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,140
Can't sit in the in the bar with Christina my daughter and talk to you like this cuz she'd probably burst out laughing

135
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,360
If you heard me talking to myself, so that's it

136
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,660
For today's edition

137
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
If you do have any ideas about the software

138
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,860
That that I need you know that has a mic channel

139
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,540
Please drop me line Adam at curry calm

140
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,420
Or you know leave a comment anywhere on my web log live

141
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,540
Curie calm l i v e dot curry calm

142
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:44,860
Well, I guess it should have said the beginning. This was source code for Saturday August 14th 2004 and

143
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,460
We'll talk to you again tomorrow

144
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Bye
