1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Delta Shara Charley 2-4-2.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,960
Everybody how you doing?

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,920
It's 10 a.m. here in sunny Northern California, sunny just a little bit hazy still.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
It is Monday, September 19th, 2005.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Different format this morning, kind of born out in necessity, because I'm in a rush.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,160
I am behind the ball, which kind of seems to be the norm from the west coast, normally

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,800
and I really miss this, if not just missing my girls being here, and I chat by the

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,000
way is cool, but it doesn't quite cut it.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,200
We do a video conference as often as we can, almost every day, and my cell phone is starting

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,760
to fear there.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,360
Because normally I'm five hours ahead of New York, and this is my whole lot of seconds.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,160
So my blackberry, which I'm learning how to love and hate at the same time.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:16,200
I saw I'm eight hours ahead of San Francisco when I'm in at the cottage.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,760
So here at the condo, it's like I feel really behind everything, besides the fact that

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,960
you see my girls are now having dinner, it's a night time.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,520
I've got the East Coast waiting on stuff for the pod show on serious, and I still have

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,200
to do the daily source code, and today, I'm scheduled to travel to Chicago, and of course

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
when you travel, East word is then you pick up a whole bunch of hours, so we're going

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,400
to leave the office, I'm going with the Chris and meeting up with Ron in Chicago.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,760
That is, blah blah blah, let me see.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,920
So we fly at 2.30 and we don't get until 8 or 9, so you just lose all this time.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,720
It's a real disadvantage.

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,640
We need to work on time, time travel.

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,640
So I just figured it out, and I had a lot of work this weekend, I worked on the condo, hanging

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,800
up pictures, and I'd quite proud of myself, actually.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,680
I found a hardware store not too far from here, picked up all the necessary items to, but

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,920
just about this huge heavy mirror, and she's like, oh, you got to get some handymen

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,520
or some guys to hang that up for you, and said, hey, hold on a second, I'm no pussy.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,680
So determined not to be beaten down by that remark, I got these cool, you know, these

30
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,360
like mega plugs, especially for drywall, because of course, you know, everything that's

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,160
built today is drywall, and it's hanging, and it's still there, knock on drywall.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,040
And then I did some work, once you did a new pod finder, which should be out tomorrow

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:52,720
on Apple's iTunes, did a whole bunch of, well, a second incoming call, I'm going to have

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,000
to ignore for the moment, sorry.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's see, and then last night, and I actually wanted to do that Saturday, but it was

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,440
too busy hanging stuff up, I reconnected with a really, really good old friend Greg

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Lawley, and I'll tell you a little bit more about him, but first staying with Chicago

38
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,760
for a second.

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,320
Now I was supposed to hook up with Madge, and I think I said on the Thursday source code,

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,200
there's a Friday source code that, you know, that may not happen.

41
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,840
Actually, I worked it out now, so that I'm staying overnight, so I definitely could have

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,400
hooked up with Madge tonight, and lo and behold, here's a little voice message from

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,880
her lovelyness from Chicago.

44
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,120
Listen Adam, it's Madge here, and I'm a little bit pissed off.

45
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
Well, a little is sort of an understatement, now you thought that I would be angry at you

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,920
for not being able to stop by my home in Chicago when you are visiting with your, whatever

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,520
it is you're doing with your ad agencies or PR, I don't know what you're doing.

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,680
So you said on your show Friday the 16th, well, isn't Madge going to be pissed, because

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
I can't visit with her.

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Well, listen, Mary, don't give yourself so much credit.

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Now here's why I'm pissed, it's not because you can't visit me.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,040
Oh, can't, chair, Adam's curry.

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,360
It's because you obviously haven't been listening to my show, your own family's pod show,

54
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,920
and you had no idea that I'm in fucking Amsterdam all week for the video blogging convention.

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,160
I've, oh, can't, oh, can't chair, Madge.

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,120
I knew you were there, but I'm sorry.

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,720
I didn't receive your entire schedule with your return flight, so I figured you'd be back

58
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
and that you, who did know I was going to be in Chicago would schedule your life

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,280
around me, but the hell is this shit, be it?

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,760
Anyway, so I also wanted to tell you that I've been gossiping a little, you were quite

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
famous here in the Netherlands.

62
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,920
What I was told by, uh, I met with the slurie source with a duke slurie and cut slurie,

63
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,040
and, um, and some other people like Bicycles Mark and Mindcastes Mark, well, anyway,

64
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,880
they tell me that you were in a reality TV show here in Holland, and there was a

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
time.

66
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Hold on.

67
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,160
First of all, I wasn't in a reality TV show.

68
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,120
We created and produced our own show called Adams Family, 13 episodes, um, and we did it

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,460
entirely on Final Cut Pro, did it all ourselves, small team, had a cameraman who we knew

70
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,360
for 25 years, lived with us for a couple months while we did this show.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,600
And really, it was, um, a lot of the Adams family was a precursor to the Daily Source

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,760
Code, um, because our show really was a true reality show, because it was us.

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,400
It was not, in fact, it was, we were so ourselves that people thought we were acting,

74
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
which, which really was, that was something I didn't expect, which is a pretty fucking

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,640
mind, it was a big mind trip.

76
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,480
Um, so everything that went in that show, um, was real happened for real, um, of course

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
to him.

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,520
It was, it was edited, uh, just to take out the boring bits, but it was no voiceover, no narration,

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,160
um, it was a great project, very successful, very, very, very, very proud of it.

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,240
And then you, um, we're wearing a bathrobe, and okay, yeah, this is indeed something

81
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
that did happen.

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,880
Shooting video of yourself, or something, and you accidentally, quote, unquote, shot

83
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
a video of yourself.

84
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,480
You see, quote, unquote, you can tell that whoever told the story said, oh, you know, it

85
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
was all fake.

86
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,120
No, it was just too good to be real, I guess, is what people thought, um, with the sort

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,640
of robe open when you were shooting and, and there was a glam, uh, there was an image

88
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
captured of your penis.

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,360
Now, before I get further into this gossip, what I was wondering is, since I know you

90
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,160
like people to come to you first, is, are you, would you like to post a picture or what,

91
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,360
or, um, you know, what's the story here?

92
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
Because I don't believe I've ever heard about this.

93
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,800
Now, Ducks Lurdy said, he said, ask Adam, because Adam would probably be glad to give

94
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,160
you the picture of the penis.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Now, you know that I'm a lesbian sociologist.

96
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,240
You know that I have, um, a vested interest in these matters, because, you know, I am

97
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,800
the Margaret Mead of podcasting, or the Jane Goodall, as it were, anyway, um, I wanted

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
to let you know that my disc is almost full.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Bye Adam, see you later.

100
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah, my match.

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,760
Actually, uh, a picture of that, yeah, you just Google Adam Korean penis, and it'll

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,400
probably show up on Google, uh, because here's what happened.

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,880
Uh, that shot was actually, um, no one even knew it.

104
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,920
But I didn't know that, um, that I had caught that on tape when I was filming something.

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,760
I was filming Patricia actually in the mirror.

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,320
She was, uh, it's a long story.

107
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,360
But, um, when, um, when our editor caught yeah, well, I, she's more in the editor.

108
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
She was really, she really coproduced the show with me.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,320
Um, when she saw this, uh, this piece of footage, um, and she put it in the show, and

110
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,480
she said, um, did you notice anything, um, you know, like, you know, I was at 17

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,360
minutes in, and, you know, this many seconds and so many frames.

112
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,120
She said, uh, take a look at that, and so that's what Patricia and I saw it with, oh, man,

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
that's pretty funny.

114
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,200
We don't think anyone will see it.

115
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,040
And so we debated, we said, I just leave it in there, because, you know, Patricia,

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,760
by the way, had been kind of caught on camera, nude or semi nude a couple of times.

117
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,800
She said, well, why the hell should you be taken out, and any women always have to be

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
left in.

119
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I do agree with that.

120
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,360
Um, and, uh, didn't hear anything about it for about a week until some other guy on a pretty

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,880
famous late night talk show said that he had seen the show in, in a repeat, actually,

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,720
a repeated, uh, aired on Saturdays and repeated on Wednesdays.

123
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,440
And he said, oh, and look what I saw, and then he put up full screen, a freeze frame with

124
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
like, you know, a telecaster kind of thing, you know, a drew a picture around the offending

125
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
scenes, and then the offending areas of the, of the, of the picture.

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,920
And that, of course, will be blew it out, and then everyone knew all about it.

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
So, uh, you can find that on your own.

128
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,640
We'll be more interesting, uh, imagine I have, uh, all 13 episodes on, uh, on DVD, uh,

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,240
because we're not, we're not, you know, it was like, it aired.

130
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,760
One's original, and then we had two, I think, two, uh, repeat three, actually, uh, yeah, so

131
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
in total four.

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
And then that's it.

133
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,400
Now, uh, they, you know, nothing will ever be seen from that show on television again.

134
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,520
And, uh, maybe in a couple of years, we'll put out a DVD.

135
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,040
Maybe in 20 years, who knows, but, uh, kind of like our family document.

136
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,400
So, if you'd like, uh, when you actually do, keep to your, um, keep your own schedule

137
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
magic.

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,800
And when you're ready for me to blow into town, baby, and you're not off an Amsterdam,

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,800
and we'll bring the DVDs with me, and we can have a little viewing part.

140
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Can you hear me?

141

do?

166
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560

Can you hear me?

208
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, have it you do, I hope it's been a long time, but what

209
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
do?

210
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Do?

211
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Can you hear me?

212
00:11:51,060 --> 00:12:05,560
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, have it you do, I hope it's been a long time, but what

213
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
do?

214
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,560
You were in a great honour, wasn't it?

215
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:41,160
Let's try it again.

216
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Let's try it again, let's try it again, let's try it again.

217
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Let's try it again, let's try it again.

218
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Without a doubt, one of the kings of the matchup scene, D.J., B.C.

219
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,160
I put him right up there with D.J. earworm.

220
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Nice chair, take your hair, biz knocking on your daily source code.

221
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I was trying to make some coffee during that matchup.

222
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Patricia was able to fill up some of the apartment before she left when we were on vacation

223
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,160
with some stuff, and it's interesting because she knows how I love my coffee in my

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,160
and especially cup of chinos.

225
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,160
She got me a coffee machine, which is not a senseo, which is okay, because senseo doesn't

226
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
really do cup of chinos very well.

227
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,160
But now I remember why I hate these home and take the headphones off.

228
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Now I remember why I dislike regular coffee machines, because as I was trying to empty out

229
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,160
the crunch from the previous coffee session, of course, it's still all over the floor.

230
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:37,160
So, we know what that is.

231
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,160
One thing is important, it has its plenty of power outlets.

232
00:14:41,160 --> 00:15:09,160
So, I guess I should see it now, that's another thing I forgot to bring is I didn't bring my

233
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:19,160
extension cord for my headphones.

234
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Anyway, I'm kind of scrambling around a bit, because in Chicago we're going to be doing

235
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,160
another one of our presentations, actually not one, but two of our presentations.

236
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,160
That'll all be tomorrow, the first one is at nine, which is while we're flying in tonight.

237
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
So, I'm bringing the studio, because we actually do like a podcast.

238
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
That's how this presentation is put together.

239
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
It's pretty cool.

240
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,160
So, I think I got to bring the mixer and I have my suitcase.

241
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Actually, I need a flight case for it to be perfectly honest.

242
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Oh, fuck.

243
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Sorry.

244
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I did it again.

245
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
All right.

246
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Once again, I'm, now I really remember why I like senseo.

247
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm done.

248
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm too clumsy for the shit.

249
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Okay.

250
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Yeah.

251
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
So, now that's all it's done.

252
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
This is a group, by the way.

253
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,160
K.R. Kilo, Romeo, uniform, Papa, Sierra, which is a great brand for coffee maker.

254
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
All right.

255
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I just desperately need to get some.

256
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Get casually.

257
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,160
So, last night.

258
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Last night.

259
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I went over to see Greg Lawly.

260
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,160
I hadn't seen Greg in 11 years.

261
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:39,160
I met him when I had a radio show, a syndicated radio show, which means that it was on,

262
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I don't know, it was on a couple hundred stations throughout the U.S.

263
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
And it was produced, you know, I produced it myself.

264
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,160
And, you know, I owned the show.

265
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,160
I actually co-owned the show with the, with media America in New York.

266
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,160
And I was called Endless Summer Entertainment in, in the Malibu, California.

267
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,160
And the way it works is, it was a, you know, a top 30 countdown show.

268
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
And this is all pre-internet, although we were the first beta testers of pro tools at the time,

269
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
which was very, very cool because we put the show.

270
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
One of the first shows we put together digitally.

271
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
And this was, as I said, you know, this was like 12 years ago.

272
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
And so, the way it would work is, you know, you'd sell national advertising.

273
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,160
So, we sold the reboc and a Pepsi because we were on all these stations.

274
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,160
And the way you got it on the stations is you said to the radio station,

275
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
here's three hours you can play it on a Saturday morning or Sunday morning,

276
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
you know, within certain time period.

277
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,160
And we're, you know, X amount of minutes per hour,

278
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
we sell for national advertising and the rest you can sell.

279
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
And, of course, at the time I was on MTV.

280
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,160
And so, you know, then I do all kinds of personalized stuff, you know,

281
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
hey, it's Adam Curry, the MTV guy of Robota.

282
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,160
And, and invariably, there would be a, you know, a summer jam or a summer fest,

283
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
or a B96 blowout or whatever.

284
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
And I would have gone host those.

285
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,160
And this is not uncommon, by the way, in the business,

286
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
because artists do this all the time.

287
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,160
They'll go and they'll perform at a summer jam or a B96 blowout or whatever.

288
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
For free, to make sure that, you know, this station,

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,160
depending on how big the station is, plays their record, basically.

290
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
You know, it's tit for tat.

291
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,160
And one of the people who coordinates that is Greg Lawley.

292
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,160
And at the time he was working from a clasque as an associates,

293
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,160
which, these type of organizations, there's not a lot of them left,

294
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
but they're called independent promoters.

295
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,160
And the record companies hire these independent promoters

296
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
to promote their stuff on stations.

297
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
And usually a radio station will work with, you know,

298
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
one or two of these independent promoters.

299
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
And the whole deal is station says,

300
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,160
we've talked about this many, many times before on the source code.

301
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Hey, man, you know, we'd really like to get,

302
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
at the time, it was like Marky Mark,

303
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,160
SWV, that's sisters with voices.

304
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,160
TLC, even.

305
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Excuse me.

306
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
And they'd be out promoting their record.

307
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
So, hey, you know, we would have in our summer jam,

308
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
and then they call up Greg,

309
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
and then Greg would make sure that, you know, he'd get the right artist there,

310
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
or an interview, or, you know, maybe some price,

311
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,160
whatever it is, whatever, basically,

312
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
was needed to have the station play a record.

313
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,160
And so, you know, our Greg and I,

314
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
you know, our paths kind of...

315
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Oops, hold on.

316
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I got to do this.

317
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Otherwise the steam goes out.

318
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Okay, hold on.

319
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Bear with me now.

320
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
All right, so that's the coffee part.

321
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Now we hit the steam.

322
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Come on.

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Yeah.

324
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
It only since sale may,

325
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,160
that cappuccino system might be completely happy.

326
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I never get this a real bright.

327
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
What I usually want to go through is,

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
it's part milk.

329
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
It's kind of working.

330
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,160
It's must be incredibly boring for you, though.

331
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,160
And so, I have to share our time today,

332
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,160
which is a kind of work.

333
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh, man.

334
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,160
And now there's all coffee on the...

335
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
This is, I'm really butchering this.

336
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,160
I think that once I figure out where I'm going to buy a television,

337
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,160
another household appliance I don't have,

338
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I think I show five years and sale at the same time.

339
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Okay, so I've made a right message.

340
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Okay.

341
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Anyway, so independent promoter.

342
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
So we were basically every weekend.

343
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I was on the road promoting,

344
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,160
you know, going to these radio stations

345
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,160
and, you know, which of course was the way that a station would say,

346
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
okay, we'll put your show on the air.

347
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,160
And I kept meeting this Greg guy.

348
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
It was really, really nice, very energetic.

349
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I've been on the radio myself.

350
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,160
I mean, there's barely anyone who knows so much about music,

351
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,160
at music trivia, and just super, super nice guy.

352
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,160
And so we kind of lost touch after,

353
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
well, he was actually trying to leave that company

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
and, you know, at the time,

355
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
we were just about getting started on this internet thing.

356
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
And so, we kind of lost touch.

357
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,160
And then, as this pod safe music stuff started to happen,

358
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
I thought, who can we bring into this?

359
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Who knows, you know, how the record industry works,

360
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
the music industry, you know, so that we can really

361
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
work on creating our own music industry.

362
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,160
You already have quite a bit going on with the pod safe music network.

363
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,160
And, but not make some of the same mistakes

364
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,160
that the other, you know, that the other music industry made.

365
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
And so, I reached out to him when it turns out,

366
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
he moved from Chicago to San Francisco.

367
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,160
And he has a 22-month-old son now.

368
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,160
And so, I went over to his house,

369
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,160
which is overlooking, that's fucking beautiful.

370
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Overlooking the ocean.

371
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I forget what the area is,

372
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
but it's like 17th Avenue.

373
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,160
It's way the hell over there, west from where I am.

374
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
And, first of all, you walk into his house,

375
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
and it's like the hard rock cafe.

376
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
The people in the music business call him Daddy.

377
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,160
So he's got, you know, just the whole wall, wall to wall,

378
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
posters, guitars.

379
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Actually, he doesn't have a lot of gotty gold records,

380
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,160
although he has them, but he has some stored away in the garage.

381
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
But, you know, he has a new name,

382
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,160
but any band that has any name has signed a guitar.

383
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
You know, there's like Madonna saying,

384
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Hey, thank you, Daddy.

385
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Sharday, Mariah Carey.

386
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I mean, it's all there.

387
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,160
He's very well known in the business.

388
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
And he started his own company.

389
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
And so he's doing that from self.

390
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
And I think he does like 20 or 30 stations.

391
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
So he's pretty busy.

392
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,160
But we had a great time as if 11 years had,

393
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
you know, not even just gone by in the wink of an eye.

394
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
And we completely picked up where we were.

395
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,160
And we wound up just playing mashups for each other.

396
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,160
You know, he's just starting to figure out what podcasting is about.

397
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Because, of course, he has kind of entrenched in the traditional,

398
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
traditional music scene.

399
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,160
But I think that we can do some really interesting stuff together.

400
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,160
And so, of course, I had, what he gave me,

401
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,160
one vodka and juice.

402
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
And I have such a freaking head at, you know,

403
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm not a drinker, right?

404
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
I don't drink at all.

405
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
I'm a smoker.

406
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
So, I guess I have a hangover.

407
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Oh my god, from one vodka and juice.

408
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
What are we going to do with me?

409
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,160
35% of American churches play traditional worship music.

410
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,160
16% play contemporary Christian.

411
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
7% gospel.

412
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,160
6% praise and worship.

413
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
But none of them are playing this.

414
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:28,160
The word again, Christian podcast plays Christian music for people who hate Christian music.

415
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,160
All the glory that the Lord has made and the complications you could do without.

416
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Join me, just peed every week, as I play the best under-discovered bands

417
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
with a fresh look at faith.

418
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,160
The board again, Christian podcast.

419
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Online at board again, Christian.com.

420
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Listen, religiously.

421
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
This is an introduction to the overclocked podcast.

422
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
My name is Bluja.

423
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm the�.

424
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,160
In Wikipedia, the definition for overclocking is this.

425
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Overclocking is making a computer component run at a higher clock speed than the manufacturers,

426
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
specifications.

427
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Overclocking can result in system instability, but the fastest home computers in the world are overclocked.

428
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,160
However, this show is not about overclocking computers.

429
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,160
We're talking about overclocking humans.

430
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Anotech Superconductors, string theory, artificial life, quantum logic.

431
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Emergent machines, sapiens, neuro, pharmacology, the black holes of the faith they think they think they think they think they think they think they think.

432
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Yeah, she's the Honorable Chester Academy.

433
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Sure, understanding today's complex world of the future is

434
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
unlike having these living your head.

435
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
But there they are.

436
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
I feel like that myself once in a while.

437
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Okay, um, uh, last week I played for you a promo of the Satan cast

438
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,160
because yes, Satan has joined the podcasting phrase well.

439
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,160
And this showed up all of a sudden in my Gmail box.

440
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Our next performer claims he wrote the song about to hear.

441
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Mm-hmm.

442
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Let's give a big round of applause right here

443
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,160
to Satan and the young willing.

444
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm not going to play the whole song.

445
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,160
But the lyrics are hilarious.

446
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
It's a little bit of a Satan ending.

447
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,160
What was it that I'm willing?

448
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Of course, Lucifer would come up with his own version of her

449
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
in a podcast right?

450
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Do you remember?

451
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Before I came here,

452
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I'd casting words as nice as Santa's fucking reindeer.

453
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,160
And that could say, turn the kick a little less.

454
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Well, Adam Cruise makes him sound like he is talking breadhead.

455
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,160
There's out and whole too far hold.

456
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,160
His arm could have kicked him off.

457
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:42,160
I've already separated you with TV and paper and every other media.

458
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I think I'm going to find it.

459
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,160
You've got to watch my language man.

460
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm going to bring it all.

461
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
You know, I'll let it play out.

462
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,160
You can't actually have ever seen the time I hear.

463
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Come on, Satan hit me by the egg.

464
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Come hear me, Jimmy.

465
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
A girl looks for me.

466
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,160
A guy who's ninja casting, he's just kind of cookie.

467
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
A form of DJ.

468
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Five guys who are gay, two American singers.

469
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,160
And myself a big number of men.

470
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I used to even have a lift me at a guy at exit 50.

471
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,160
A trucker to an odd guess as it's too long over six.

472
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,160
And this rather crit is double water.

473
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
First computer.

474
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,160
A crazy man, the solterie man, of can be cougar.

475
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Your horses have been free.

476
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,160
And I have come to cast my sea.

477
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
You're a hunna hunna.

478
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I've heard it getting loaded in this.

479
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I've got a warm and funnier with you.

480
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh yeah.

481
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:04,160
And I bought all of their songs.

482
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,160
They've got a bunch of them.

483
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
The third part is precious.

484
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Fuckin' this would be also about to widen eating breakfast.

485
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
It can change the ball.

486
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Lots of me fight questions.

487
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Or has he ever tried?

488
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I've got a bunch of them.

489
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Call Catholic Insider.

490
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
A body cast.

491
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,160
God, your kids is time to exercise.

492
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Contact every safer.

493
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
D&D and C cast.

494
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,160
No one's name is Safety Red All.

495
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
No one's name is Safe.

496
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,160
No one's name is Safety Red All.

497
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
No one's really safe.

498
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,160
No one's name is Safety Red All.

499
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,160
No one's name is Safety Red All.

500
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Safety Red All.

501
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Safety cast.

502
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Shit.

503
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,160
All right, it was worth hearing it again.

504
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Satan.

505
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,160
You've got no musical chops man, but I do appreciate the effort for you.

506
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Satan in the unwilling live.

507
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm here to screw up the podcasting.

508
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Well, I guess we are forewarned.

509
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Wow, I can't believe it.

510
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
I've been here for 30 minutes.

511
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Okay, I have to do a couple other things.

512
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Got to pack up the studio.

513
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Got to get going.

514
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
And actually it's on the rolling wheels.

515
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,160
So I'm going to walk over to the office.

516
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,160
And then tonight when I'm in Chicago, I'll cut another show for tomorrow morning.

517
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,160
So hopefully you'll have that for your morning commute.

518
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,160
And I wanted to leave you with something different.

519
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Hold on.

520
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Where the heck is it?

521
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Yes, it's a song from 1969.

522
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,160
You know, because I just wanted to work a little bit in our musical
