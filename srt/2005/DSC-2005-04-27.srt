00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Daily source code April 27, 2005.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yo DJ, are you done?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Me too!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
$16 billion worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do you know me?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We don't need no sticky drinks, man.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey everybody, from the cottage in the UK, it's the Daily Source code.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we're back on the air.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What a bunch of crap yesterday.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh my goodness.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I had completely underestimated the amount of bandwidth I would need.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When he switched from my dot mac hosting infrastructure to the pod show infrastructure.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But we've opened the floodgates.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So now we've got the bandwidth up and running.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Everyone's able to get the show.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hopefully you're able to listen to yesterday's show.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I realize that what happens often in these cases is

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
some iPodders will either download half the file or

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
some portion of the file and then skip over it.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or not download anything and skip over it.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So you may have lost yesterday's show.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Of course, encourage you to go immediately to

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
dailysourcecode.com and download it directly for that's up to you.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Today, more pod safe music, some promos and news about my upcoming trip.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Actually, when I say upcoming trip, the trip starts tonight.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Right now it is 11 o'clock in the curry cottage.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
11 a.m. that is on Wednesday morning.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I leave tonight.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think it's 815 or 830 when I hop on the big red virgin bird

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and jet off to Nueva Yorka.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Two days of meetings, then the weekend.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And then we're going to kind of see if we can go out to the west coast or not.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm still trying to firm up those plans.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Figure this and some people wanted to see us.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It would be easier just to stay in the states and then do a Monday and Tuesday meeting.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But it doesn't happen, then I'll go back and I'll be back in a couple of weeks.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey, New York's where all the publishing money is.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's where it's all coming from.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, and of course tomorrow, we now have a firm commitment tomorrow.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ron and I are going to do another strategy task because we're getting pretty close to some real announcements.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know, I know I'm stringing young, but you know, we've been building up steam and getting everything set.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And you're seeing a bit by bit pieces are starting to happen.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Cast blaster now in beta.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Although not all of the beta invites have gone out.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Of course, if you've downloaded that application sent in your mixer statistics, your computers mixer.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then you will be hearing about the beta test.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think it could be up to a week.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We were just delugeed with email and one thing.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We were talking about blind people.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And oh, yes, we've had the conversation about the politically correct way to say it.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The politically impaired is that the blind community doesn't matter.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You know, you are.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And by the way, I'm getting there myself.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Dan, you know, without my glasses and it keeps getting just a little bit worse every single time I haven't checked.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I am completely visually impaired if I don't have my glasses.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So lots of feedback about many, and I talked about this yesterday.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Many, many different initiatives.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And of course, now there are lots of folks who would love to jump in and start reading newspapers

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and magazines for the blind and podcasting that.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And there's all kinds of intellectual property issues there, obviously.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I would of course encourage, you know, these types of publications to figure out a way to service

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
this rather large group of people who apparently are very interested.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But perhaps even more interesting is getting the visually impaired to podcast, helping them out with that.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I was talking to Mike, one of the developers of the cast blaster.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And we're talking about, because apparently there are all kinds of hooks and stuff that you can put into

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
into your applications that hook into Windows accessibility, API or something like that.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Something I definitely have to delve into a little bit deeper.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And although we haven't done any of that in the cast blaster as of yet,

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we do, of course, have Jan Palette, who does the hit test.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's also a cast blaster, beta tester.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And he's giving us a lot of information on what we can do because he's visually impaired.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And, you know, I hope to make not just, you know, all applications I'm involved in,

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
but also websites, much more visually impaired friendly, VIF, if you will.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And today, a first on the Daily Source Code, I'm proud to present a paid commercial.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now it's possible to get close to Paris Hilton, even without your passport.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Beginning April 29, tune into Paris Hilton's podcast and spend some time with Paris on account

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
down to the house of wax.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right, all Paris all the time.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
To get the Paris Hilton podcast, go to www.houseofwexmovie.com

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and click on the podcast link in the mountain.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's the biggest season, but yeah.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, the Paris Hilton podcast starts as she counts down to the house of wax.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's the opening of the movie.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a remake, I guess.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The house of wax.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And, you know, despite the promo, which is very slick, very professional, like the singers.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think you're going to see a pretty raw, well, we've seen several sides of Paris,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
but I think you're going to see a very raw side, very unedited single voice of her.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because that's one of the things that I talked to a lot of the folks over at Warner Brothers about

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
is they were thinking about doing this podcast or approaching Paris about doing it.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She jumped right on, she totally gets it.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And I hope that they won't be doing any post-editing of what she's doing,

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
but I know that she'll be walking around with a recorder.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was supposed to interview her, and this has nothing to do with commercials or anything.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This was just a request we put in.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The interviewer about the podcast.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This was supposed to happen tomorrow.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
She's on David Letterman.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I presume then tomorrow night.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And she's going to call me from the green room.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now, since I'm going to be in New York,

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
of course, I said, well, why don't I try and do a sound seeing tour

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
from, you know, the, basically, the entrance of the building.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, no, it's not Rockefeller Center, I'm sorry.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
At the CBS Broadcast Plaza, that's what it is.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, no, no, no, no, wrong again.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the Ed Sullivan Theatre, that's where it is.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And hopefully just do a one-on-one with Paris in the green room,

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
without having to deal with the telephone line.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And of course, I have it all set up, in case she doesn't want to,

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but it's going to be kind of silly.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I hope we get that worked out.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And we'll ask her, we'll ask her straight up,

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
what the plan is, and what she's going to do,

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and how is she putting it together?

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think we could all be surprised by young Miss Paris.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So daily source code today, I want to celebrate

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
a great piece that aired on CBS,

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Evening News yesterday.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This was the thing that I was interviewed for,

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the piece that I was interviewed for in January,

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
if you can believe it.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Four months old, unbelievable,

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
actually almost five months old now, this footage.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And my hair has already been cut and grown back since then,

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
it's almost the same length.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And it was obviously much shorter than all of the stuff that I,

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
you know, put in there,

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
but what was really cool is Sharon O'Fancy,

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and her producer, the lovely Linda,

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
who now, of course, I'm going to have to take out the dinner,

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
because she finally got this thing on the air,

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and it's all of the Dan Rather controversy

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and changing of hosts.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I have no idea how, you know,

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
they must have had a couple minutes left over in the show,

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and what the hell can we put?

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh yeah, let's grab this thing off the shelf.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They really skewed it towards the music aspect,

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and I'm really happy about that.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I put a link on Curried.com today,

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
so you can actually see a piece of the video,

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
or the whole piece that aired,

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and they totally clued right into those serious bitties,

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and how that worked when I first stumbled across their stuff,

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I started playing it,

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and other people started playing it,

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Brian from Coverfield didn't interview with them,

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and they started selling CDs,

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because, you know,

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
they can sell them directly online,

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
they press their own CDs,

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
they've got their own little company that handles all of that,

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and of course they all work for the company themselves,

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
but, you know, they've got all the elements they need,

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and they're putting 90% to 95% of the revenue directly in their pocket,

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
so a couple hundred CDs sold,

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and it's a big deal,

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
particularly if you're hungry in New York.

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But it was great,

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
no pieces of interview with the bitties unfortunately,

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but it was very clear,

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and I hope that,

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I hope that the people who need to know this kind of stuff

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
were paying attention,

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and particularly that's the artist,

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and I did get a lot of email from people saying,

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
okay, how do I do this?

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How do I get into it?

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's part of what Ron and I will be talking about

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
in our strategy cast,

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
which will do Thursday.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It'll be about something we're calling

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the Pods Safe Music Network,

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and it's going to be extremely cool.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Right now to celebrate the bitties,

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
one of my favorite songs,

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hello of a boy,

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
on the Daily Source God.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's not like,

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
he doesn't know just what to say,

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to make you feel right,

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
stay up nights,

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
think of him all day,

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
where his song is true,

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but his head key,

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
getting in the way.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No, it's not like,

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
he's got a nasty disposition,

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
wants to keep you locked up tight,

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
knock the bright,

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
barefoot in the kitchen,

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
he's a hell of a boy,

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
on the,

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
only half of a man.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, it's not like,

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the boys about it,

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
born on the wrong side of town,

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
under the wrong moon,

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
on the wrong day.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He's a hell of a boy,

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but only half of a man.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Half of a man.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just what do you think you will get,

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
if he persists thinking,

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
this is the best you can do,

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
say no to your life girl,

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll be fine,

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll know it,

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
your life's going to say no to you,

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
easy call,

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
easy call,

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
life's too short,

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
to live it so,

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
now it's not like,

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
it's more than you can stand,

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
to have that pretty boy,

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
sitting next to you,

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
kissing you,

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
holding your hand.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He's a hell of a boy,

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but only half of a man.

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh man,

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
sometimes it's just close my eyes,

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
listen that song,

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
think oh yeah,

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
they're singing about me,

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the Bitties.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Check them out on the show notes,

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and go buy their CD,

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
will you?

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The lascivious Bitties on your daily source code.

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Working for someone else sucks, doesn't it?

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It doesn't have to be that way,

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that's right,

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
time to take control of your business life,

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
time to bust out of that cubicle.

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm Jonathan Brown,

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and I'm Matt Compton,

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
stop working for the man and start working for yourself,

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
listen to the cubicle scape pod,

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
visit www.cubicleacape.com,

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that's www.cubicleacape.com.

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay, yeah,

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
good podcast.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We'll help you escape,

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
working for the man.

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Would it be great if we could all just sit around

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and be podcasting all day,

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
working for ourselves,

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and make enough money off of selling

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Senseo,

256
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
coffee machines,

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and promoting other people's podcasts?

258
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, wonderful world.

259
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hey, by the way,

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the weather today sucks mega.

261
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's even worse than it was the past two days.

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It just all of a sudden,

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
actually it was a little sunny this morning,

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
it's got overcast and cloudy.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Now it's raining,

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
not a nice day.

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A nice day to travel though.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I always like to travel when it's raining,

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you know,

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
because nothing else you can do,

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
but sit inside.

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Ivan and Roxy,

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
my sister-in-law and my niece,

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
they'll be leaving today as well,

275
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
going back to Rotterdam,

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
where they live.

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So Patricia and Christina

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
will be alone for the next couple days,

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and they'll be catching up on

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
all the stuff that we've kind of left.

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You know,

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
there's lots of hours of work to be done.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And we're trying to get Christina to do it all,

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
let me see.

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What are the things I need to talk to you about today?

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hmm.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I haven't seen the entire magazine.

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I saw the cover of one of the gossip magazines

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
in the Netherlands.

290
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll put a link to it in the show notes,

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
so you can see it,

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
that remember the paparazzi was hanging out

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
in front of our house.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So I'm sure there's an in front of our house

295
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
picture or a house picture inside the magazine,

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
but they also got a shopping.

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's so funny.

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It looks like they're shopping.

299
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And we're walking down the high street in Guilford.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So they must have followed us,

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
which of course isn't that hard to do.

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's a pretty close-knit community,

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
close proximity really.

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So what was the headline?

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's like Adam,

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
you know,

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the prefay that's the name of this magazine

308
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
has found Adam and Patricia.

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They've been hiding away in England.

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes, we have.

311
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We've been hiding from you,

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Docs.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Didn't you realize that yet?

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You're listening to the Johnny B.

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Show podcasting.

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
In Minnesota.

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's the Johnny B.

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Alright, Adam,

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
this is Johnny B.

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And with me is Jason Gears,

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
part-time,

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
done so the Northwest Noise podcast with Tim Germer.

323
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I'm with the Johnny B.

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Show,

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and we're doing a live show at Burnsville High School in Minnesota,

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
where we recorded some drum lines.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Adam, we missed you.

328
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And please come to Minnesota,

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
keep us both warm.

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, that's great.

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I'll put in all the junkies stuff.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, I love it.

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So go to JohnnyB.com and check out my shows.

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
They're new,

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
just starting kind of rough,

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
playing with mics,

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
interviewing people, friends, family.

340
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Just having a good time with sounds,

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and the whole podcast,

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
dilemma here in Minnesota.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So stay tuned.

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's J-O-H-N-E-E-B-E-E.

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right on.

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Go ahead, Ben.

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Play with sound.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Get some stuff going.

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I hope we can get better recordings of the drum lines, though.

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I love the drum cadence.

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Haven't done that in a long time.

352
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you got a drum cadence,

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
one that we haven't played,

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
shoot it off to adamaccurry.com.

355
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And if you have a promo,

356
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you'd like to play.

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And of course,

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't play the mall.

359
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I do have to make a selection based upon

360
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
ones that make me laugh,

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
smile, cry, whatever.

362
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's adamaccurry.com.

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Putting the subject line,

364
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
D-S-C,

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
promo,

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and then the name of your podcast,

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
they'll get routed into the right bin.

368
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And when I found in the bin today,

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
specifically stated,

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
play before Mother's Day.

371
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So I said,

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
all right,

373
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I definitely will.

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's kind of,

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it's a double,

376
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
it's a promo,

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and it's a pod save tune all in one.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But good enough to let you join in the fun here today.

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So you're the power of pure stupidity,

380
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the banknabbagebjson.com.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
All right,

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm Jason.

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm Lisa.

384
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And we're from Dagnabbit,

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
available at bjson.com.

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Say hi to Adam.

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, Adam.

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah.

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He does this show.

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

391
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,500
Yeah.

393
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Yeah.

394
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
He does the show.

395
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
He called a daily service code.

396
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
You ever listened to it?

397
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
No.

398
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
You do?

399
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
No.

400
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Did you remember Adam Curry from when he used to be on MTV?

401
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
No.

402
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
You don't?

403
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I didn't watch MTV.

404
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Why?

405
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I was a little Christian girl.

406
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
My favorite kind.

407
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Well, he had lovely hair,

408
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
and he was a tall, lovely hair.

409
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Oh, man.

410
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Yeah.

411
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
And it's funny.

412
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Because we do have a saying in the Netherlands.

413
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I'll show her my hoodset.

414
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
As long as your hair is all right,

415
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
then no one will notice anything else.

416
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
It turns out to be pretty true.

417
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
That's nothing now.

418
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
And he was a tall, a donness.

419
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
I remember.

420
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
You do?

421
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Did you do like the ball?

422
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Yeah.

423
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
He didn't have head bangers ball.

424
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
And he shouldn't have been on there.

425
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Because he looked too pretty.

426
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Yeah.

427
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Wait a minute.

428
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh, okay.

429
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
I get it.

430
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
So if, you know, you have to be ugly.

431
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh, okay.

432
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Now I understand.

433
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah.

434
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
They were saying that at vh1.

435
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
What?

436
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Really?

437
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Yeah.

438
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
They were saying that he shouldn't have been on that head bangers ball.

439
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Because he was too pretty.

440
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
He only watched show that was on vh1.

441
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
So I know call somebody.

442
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
These people have absolutely no respect for their elders.

443
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
God dammit.

444
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Oh, it's not very nice.

445
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Oh, it's not.

446
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I thought Ricky Rackman was a poser.

447
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
With that.

448
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
This is the guy who replaced him.

449
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Mother's Day is coming up, you know.

450
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm a mom.

451
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
You are.

452
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm a mom.

453
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm mom.

454
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm mom.

455
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Ain't he be well at?

456
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Yes.

457
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
How old is he now?

458
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I was 16 months.

459
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Oh, be 16 months on two others day, right?

460
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Yeah.

461
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
That's right.

462
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Do you remember the present?

463
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I gave you from Mother's Day last year.

464
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
It was a beautiful, beautiful song.

465
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Yeah?

466
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Yeah.

467
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
What was it about?

468
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Mother's Day.

469
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Yeah.

470
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
And what was it called?

471
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Mother's Day.

472
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
No.

473
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
We wanted to put on a parade.

474
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,500
He decided to hold it on Mother's Day.

475
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Come to honor the greatest mom in the world.

476
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Come to honor the greatest mom in the world.

477
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
He had called on the animals in the zoo.

478
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,500
They all made him just wanted to.

479
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,500
To honor them greatest mom in the world.

480
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Come to honor the greatest mom in the world.

481
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Because you got me from it.

482
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Because you went my tears away.

483
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Who is he giving me Carlos?

484
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,500
And we're Mother's Day

485
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,500
In cold all the marching bands in the state

486
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,500
You said it's starting to be and now don't be late

We're gonna honor the greatest nomin' moon

Because you won't be gently

491
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Because you make everything okay

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Because you're right beside me

493
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Happy Mother's Day

494
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Because you kiss me slowly

495
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Because you won't waste my day

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
You're the whole world too

497
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Happy Mother's Day

498
00:21:48,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Yes, you can't be wrong

Yes, you can't be wrong

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Yes

Yes, yeah, yeah

It's Jason

503
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
It's Lisa

504
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
It's incredibly vulgar

505
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
It's Dagnabbit

506
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Very cool

507
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
And indeed it is Mother's Day

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500

Thanks Adam

514
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Wait a minute, you can't say thanks Adam until I say

515
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Hey, FML Judebox Podcast promo, come on in

516
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Thanks Adam

517
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Hey everybody

518
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
I really enjoyed taking a break from all the wannabe shock shots on the morning radio

519
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
By listening to Adam's daily source code on my way to work

520
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm JT from free musicianless.com

521
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500
And this is my contribution to the material for the 5.4 million podcast listeners in the USA

522
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
All the one my calculations is 5.45 million

523
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm the host of a weekly podcast called FML Judebox Podcast

524
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Where I play music from independent and local musicians from around the USA and beyond

525
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
I know you're trying to appear in the same top 40 songs over and over again

526
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
So I've provided songs uploaded to free musicianless.com

527
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
So you can hear a West Bank play live in your areas

528
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
And I occasionally throw in some live performances recorded exclusively for our podcast

529
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
I'll also tell you when the artists are playing so you can go see them live

530
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,500
So come listen to some good music at htp, clone slash slash beats dot feed burner dot com slash FML Judebox Podcast

531
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,500
Adam, thanks for your insight and pulling together all of this technology and making it available and the useful way for all of us to take advantage of

532
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Good luck with posture dot com

533
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
Oh, thank you very much

534
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Alright

535
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
I'm just a gap closer man. I just help close the 5% gap

536
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
But there's more gaps out there to close

537
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
There really are in the infamous words of Peter Dave and the BBC

538
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Especially with the music business

539
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
We are creating our own route around

540
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm really excited about what's happening

541
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,500
So we just need to pull more of these things together and get people like

542
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,500
You know who making podcasts like the FML Judebox podcast

543
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:51,500
And give everyone a place not just to put your songs up and make it available for purchase

544
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,500
But also a place where podcasts can go and find out what's hot, what's being played

545
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
There's a lot in there. Oh, by the way

546
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Was it the beginning of the week we were talking about

547
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Like a community access type channel on a satellite radio

548
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Station

549
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Where you could basically do like an open podcast dot org types thing and open it up and anyone could have a shot or a chance at

550
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Having their whatever their podcasts basically played

551
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
On a free to free to air well for bigger audiences put it that way just in other way to get

552
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
To get your podcasts out there and get your voice heard

553
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I'm making some headway very interesting got a couple of interesting calls and hopefully in the next couple days will have something to report on that as well

554
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
But first it is time

555
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Go one and only

556
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm going to be multiple choice

557
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Every test is multiple choice

558
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
This is a new hit this

559
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Hey, but again, I'm using a new headset with a new microphone

560
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
So I'll just have to see how this one holds up

561
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:05,500
There's one alternative left and that's a headset from by the mimic and hopefully I'll get some information today

562
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,500
And also the price because it should be more expensive than this one. Oh, we love that

563
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Okay, but we'll have to wait for that

564
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,500
There is a hit test with again three clips and here's number one

565
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Right on

566
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
I know it's not one

567
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I love that song

568
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
That's Robert Palmer the best of both worlds

569
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Excellent choice young like a lot

570
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
And this is number two

571
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Oh, you're hitting my every single right nerve ending

572
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Dream on aerosmith no doubt about it. I'd recognize that anywhere and the final one is number three

573
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,500
It's a derandoran view to a kill I think from James Bond movie times up these are the answers this is answer number one

574
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:05,500
It's Robert Palmer and it's a song from 1978 and it's called the best of both worlds

575
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Love this song

576
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
And I miss you man

577
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Robert Palmer answer number one

578
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
And this is answer number two. It's an old song

579
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,500
It's from 1973. It's aerosmith and dream on

580
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:09,500
And so number two aerosmith and dream on this is a chance

581
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,500
We got it from a James Bond movie. It's derandoran. This is a view to a kill

582
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Remember the fair light dude in it

583
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,500
You can't wait to get to the fire

584
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Right always see

585
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Derandoran and a view to a kill

586
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Well, that's it for today. Three out of three

587
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I enjoyed this one the good few heard were created by a friend of mine which at least don't you know

588
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Just because I don't have the time right now to create a hit test

589
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
I'm also very much behind on my own hit test podcast

590
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
And I still don't know when I'll have the time to create a new one

591
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I'll keep you up to date through my web lock

592
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,500
It's www.nipoleth.nl or com

593
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Doesn't matter it's J-A-N-D-O-L-E-T-D-N-L or dot com

594
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,500
And of course feedback is welcome to hit.nstategmail.com

Thanks for listening and talk to you soon. Bye-bye

596
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,500
All right, John, thank you very much once again. Good luck, man, with everything you're you're going through right now

597
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
And thanks to Reese for pre-cutting the segments there

598
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,500
And if you got a chance, just you know, record a hit test podcast

599
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Tell us what you're doing. Tell us what's going on. I get lots of email from people who want to know

600
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
And it doesn't have to be you know filled with your hit test stuff

601
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,500
It can just be your your typical young poet talking

602
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Talking for 15 minutes like that a lot and I hope to do some more that myself

603
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,500
I'm I'm quite excited. Well, if it if it doesn't work out for Thursday with with Paris Hilton

604
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Then I'll think of something else do different hotel this time

605
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,500
So maybe we'll do a new elevator setting to or without interviewing people without letting the know of course

606
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,500
But uh, man new new hotel offers new perspective and new opportunities

607
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
What do you hate?

608
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
What do you hate?

609
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Hey, how you going? Come on in here and talk to us. We're going to read you.com

610
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Hey, the radio

611
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
What's here?

612
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Hey, I got a crib

613
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,500
That's what I say when I talk talk to me. What do you feel like?

614
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Oh, my back

615
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Yeah

616
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Just here at the same end. Was it the finalist?

617
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Hello

618
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
So we're now called for all

619
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Let's get ahead eight thousand steps

620
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
So what do you hate?

621
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
What do I hate?

622
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,500
So she's like, her legs are going around in a circle and her body state in the middle

623
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Do you think that we ought to bring the cows later back around anything interesting to listen it?

624
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Yeah

625
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
No, why do you think about reasons like me just watch two girls

626
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Do you see some vomiting that continue to show?

627
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Well, now you understand why I do a pouring show. So the blood pressure will go down

628
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,500
WWWWD I'd hate the radio dot com

629
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Yeah, that's really what makes it great radio show.

630
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Used to be the morning shows before they were all packed with jingles and lots of commercials

631
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,500
And really, really tight formatting, you know, with okay, you can do a two minute talk break here

632
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
That's the beautiful thing about what we're doing with podcasting

633
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
You know, if the joke is rolling keep it going, you know, that's what nice it was really nice

634
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,500
And when you get a couple people just talking in normal people voices

635
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,500
You'll see you get some really exciting stuff

636
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
That's what the podcasting is all about

637
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,500
That's going to wind it up for today's show on a plane and just hours from now

638
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
So I'll be checking back in from the next location

639
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Which will be New York City

640
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,500
It may not be Thursday morning unless I get some incredible inspiration and opportunity to do

641
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Some kind of sound seeing tour on my trip

642
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
I get it late tonight, so we'll have to see how that goes

643
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,500
But I do have the cast glass with which means I can do it from virtually anywhere

644
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,500
So you should have no problems retreating today's show through your iPodder

645
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,500
If you don't have an iPodder go to iPodder.org

646
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
And we're going to go to software

647
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
And then I'll help you get set up

648
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,500
You can also just click it downloaded right from the website

649
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Who knows where it'll be next, right?

650
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
