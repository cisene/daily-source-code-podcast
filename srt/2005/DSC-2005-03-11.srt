1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Warning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The following podcast contains extremely annoying geeky talk about studio setups and mixing gear.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, we're off to a great start there.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey everybody, it's the day to source code.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's Friday.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, man.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think that her maiden voyage is going to turn out just fine.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, I'll be just some levels here.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you hadn't seen the picture on curry.com yet,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I got some new gear that I'm testing out today on the source code.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, okay.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So besides the usual stuff, we will be discussing the studio setup.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't believe I finally broke down and did it.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I went out to the music store and I got everything I need to create.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
More or less exactly the sound and the connections between different pieces of equipment that

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've wanted to do that I've been trying to do on software on my computer.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I just went ahead and bought all the outboard gear and I am totally loving it.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I hope the sound is starting to come along there.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So at this point, I again want to warn you that I'll be talking a lot.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm particularly beginning about these new boxes that I've purchased and I set up

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and all the different pieces and how they all fit together.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I also have a hit test coming up.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Something that was listed on your pod safe, but I'm not quite sure it is.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It sounds more like a mashup.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I got another podcast to go along.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Listen to it together.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, let me just try one thing here.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
First thing I want to do is switch to the other microphone.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I did that almost seamlessly.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now you're on the live microphone so I can get up and walk around.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I need to go over to the computer you see.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that doesn't sound too bad, does it?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hold on a second.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It makes back to the first mic.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So that's the, this is the sure the SM7.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not quite happy with the way it sounds.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a little high on the S6.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Have you ever heard people who speak like that when the S?

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And it keeps on singing.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Isn't that annoying?

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It surely does bug the hell out of me.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's see if we can get this going.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When you grow up, let it hit like a good boy out of.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And your mama digs it shine a perfect sun.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Something different.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, the girls are seeming like you.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because your pants are like you don't fit in the pool out of fun.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But now your girl is going to miss an annual house.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's got an empty bed.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The folks are wondering about the wedding.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They won't listen to what word you said.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're gonna take your mama out on that year.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're showin' what it's all about.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're gonna jack the phone from cheap champagne.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We're gonna let the good times all roll out.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're gonna sing along the metalwood.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because it doesn't mind if the new world lives.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you're different man to make us good.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're day breaks, you're my days.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're finding that all the words you've kinder.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just sing along when she no longer needs you.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
She wakes up, she wakes up.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She takes a time and doesn't feel she has to run.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She no longer needs you.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And then her eyes, you see nothing.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't sight out the love and be out of the tears.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Cry for no one.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I love that you're the last to be used.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're the last to be used.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're the last to be used.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We'll save the Eltern with a gun.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you want to do me up?

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't anathal.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can save youroko family.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a full grown man.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You want to be hurt.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And yet you don't really hurt.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When she says her love is dead, you think she needs you

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And when her eyes you see nothing

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No sign of love beyond the tears, cry for no one

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I love that she'll never last tears

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm always down there, I'm always down there

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't sleep, I'm always my girl, I'm always down

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm always down there, I'm always down there

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm just a girl, just a girl, just a girl

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't let them down, don't let them down

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know what I'm all about, forget I can't come out

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If they don't know, my heart will hurt

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If they don't know, my heart will be going

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They'll shake my cheeks, they'll always be going

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They'll walk my way up to sleep now, I'm always down

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I didn't even mention Tonight actually at that moment

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If they were better I'll never think I could

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They'll go get her, I got her with me

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just a minute on her, you and I

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Run to the abyss for all sorts of love

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, want a lot of love we, good start, yeah, that's my time, we both of you guys like you

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oops, sorry, that was a rather abrupt fade out there.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, I was really digging that too.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
From DJEarWorm.com,

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Scissors, Sisters, Beatles, George Michael,

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A Reath of Franklin.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It was almost like a mega mix,

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and a traditional mashup.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Right, too.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay, so let me tell you what happened this morning.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I went out, well, first of all,

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I dropped Christina off at school,

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and then I went to Anderton's Music Store in Guilford,

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
which is just as you enter the town,

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the road kind of a busy two-way lane street,

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and I was able to pick up a cup of coffee

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
at the gas station just before it

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
because they don't open until 930.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I read the newspaper,

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
didn't have the financial times,

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
read the Guardian front to cover,

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
basically, waiting for the store to open.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And really nice guy, sales guy named Andy,

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
helped me out, and he knew what podcasting was.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And so I tried to explain to him,

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you know, what I was looking to do.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I'd purchase the,

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Con the Soundcraft Compact 6 Mixer,

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
which I put in the show notes for yesterday's daily source code.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So you can purchase that,

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and if you buy it,

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
then I actually make 5.25%

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
until I sell another 70 items,

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
when I move up to 5.5%.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But it's actually product those movies,

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
pretty interesting.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So he already knew what gear I had at home,

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and I told him, you know, what mics I had.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And basically, what I wanted,

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I wanted a preamp for the microphone.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So, you know, I can do a little bit of effects.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You know, I have a little bit of the,

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't put reverb on,

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I put just a very little faint bit of,

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
what is it?

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's an echo plate actually.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And a little bit of compression on the microphone.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I don't know if it's too much or not,

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I just can turn out once it's all compressed to MP3.

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You know, it may sound horrible,

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
but I've been working out all day.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And what happens, you know,

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
as you're fiddling around with sound,

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
at a certain point,

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you just don't know what you're hearing anymore.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's really hard.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So let me see.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And actually, as I move over to the mixing board,

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll switch over to the second,

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
the lavelier mic,

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
which I have on,

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
which I have here on a second fader.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so I'm in front of my 19 inch rack.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
One of those 19 inch tabletop racks,

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to do the job,

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
because I had two pieces of gear,

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and I also had the M audio fire wire box.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So on the top,

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
it's kind of a cheap thing,

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but it's a multi-effects,

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
it's a TC electronic dual engine processor,

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the M300, everybody.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And so it has compression,

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
which is running only on the microphone,

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
because I took an insert from the mixer,

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so that's basically inserting it into the line,

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
before it goes into the compression part.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But after the mic preamp on this other beautiful box

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that I bought,

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
which is the TL audio, TLA,

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ivory series.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is the stereo valve processor.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And what that means is actually,

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it has tubes in it,

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and tubes were used before transistors.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And actually,

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
it's getting harder for,

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to find the replacement tubes.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think Phillips and Holland actually pretty much

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
makes most of them at this point.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But most audio files swear by the sound of two processing.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So it's two units in one.

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's four units in one.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It has two channels,

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and it has a microphone preamp

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
with a limiter.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then that's where I've put the insert

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to go out to the effects generator.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
After the microphone preamp,

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
then it comes back,

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and then it goes through the compressor,

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and then it goes through an equalizer,

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
which has a pre equalizer,

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and a main equalizer,

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and I have the two link together

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
so that provides the stereo output signal.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And of course,

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm still recording on my very trusty,

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I River IPF799,

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
which is now also listed on curie.com,

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and another fine piece of equipment to buy.

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I got some mic stands,

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
which actually I'm struggling with right now.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hold on a sec.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So I'm back on the main microphone,

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
on the sure.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, I got one of those really,

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you know, those boom mic stands,

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and I finally got a windscreen for the microphone.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So the piece,

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and I say Patricia Pi's podcast,

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
it won't plop too much.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's saying for better, excuse me,

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
a little Dutch that slipped in,

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it's much better in any case than it was.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So hooking it all up was really quite a feat,

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
actually,

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
just trying to figure out all the routing

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
in which wires go in wire,

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and Andy had drawn me a diagram,

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which came in really handy,

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
handy,

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and he's diagram.

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And it's kind of worked out.

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think there's a slight hum in this microphone,

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
though, excuse me.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's probably because I haven't really cleaned up the wires,

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
yet Patricia's nagging me,

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and she's right, of course.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, and I got a second boom microphone

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
for the handheld that I had,

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and a windscreen for that.

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So Patricia and I can both sit here and do,

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
you know,

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
we can do a PPP,

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
triple P podcast,

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
but with all the luxury that you'd expect from,

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
a studio that actually works and everything all together,

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which includes like the headphones,

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
so I have a separate headphone extension jack,

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and it's no longer with latency or delay.

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, by the way, I've also routed one output from this mixer

253
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
through the M audio fire wire device,

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
which goes into the, this is the cool part,

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
goes into the,

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
my old laptop,

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
which the screen doesn't work anymore,

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
but that's hooked up to the big cinema display.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I have a monitor output,

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll turn it up now.

261
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's delayed a little bit,

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
because that's basically the latency that I used to deal with.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's the delay I used to have on my headphones,

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
when I was talking,

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and of course,

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the delay that most of you recognize,

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
if you're using garage band and sound flower,

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and eventually this is the shit that crops up,

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
so,

270
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
oh man, there's such a big,

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
big hole in the software market,

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to create something that actually works for us,

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
but we're not quite there yet.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Maybe it's hardware, I'm not sure.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, and I also, by the way,

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
a lot of people sent me schematics and diagrams,

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and how to create a T-splitter that I can plug my iPod,

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and my microphone into simultaneously,

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
without having the levels get all messed up like they were.

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And basically I need to 10k own resistors,

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and in order to box,

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I ordered the resistors,

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and I ordered the three and a half inch jack,

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
so it's going to be completely cool.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Of course,

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'd already placed the order,

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and I realized that in order to do stereo,

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I have to have four resistors,

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
instead of the two that I ordered,

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and I'm like, what kind of dork am I?

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
In ordering two fucking resistors,

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
at 50 cents a pop,

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I probably should've just gotten a couple extra

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
just for the hell of it.

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So anyway,

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
back to the desktop,

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because you see,

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and I put a picture up on curry.com,

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
the laptop,

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
which really has all my production stuff on it,

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
has my outline for the show,

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and the quick time player in sequence,

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
is to the right of the 19 inch rack.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Now, that's not very convenient to sit,

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and do the show.

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So I opened up VNC.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know if you know what VNC is,

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but it's basically,

309
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it's a cross-platform open source application.

310
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There has many clients for all different platforms,

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and you can control a desktop.

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So seeing is it's on the same network,

313
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
there's almost no delay in dragging stuff around,

314
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and basically I've brought the desktop

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
on the power book that runs everything up on my main screen here,

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
on the cinema display,

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and I'm just kind of controlling it with the mouse over here.

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So it works.

319
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have a setup that is almost starting to look official.

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I feel kind of official too.

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Right on.

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay, so that's the new setup.

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now let's move on.

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I want to talk about here.

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, I got an email from Craig Patchett,

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
who said that recommends keeping the eye river

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that's saying the device I used to record my sound scene tours on,

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and also now I'm using it as a final end recorder.

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Keep it away from your cell phone,

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
while you're recording,

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
he says his IFP795 got reset to 00.0020,

332
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
20 minutes into a recording yesterday,

333
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
after some weird interference with his phone,

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
while the two were sitting next to each other.

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Which is pretty frightening,

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and Craig and I mailed back and forth a little bit more,

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and he said that actually the recording was also lost,

338
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and this is something that seems to happen more often.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So when you're doing those sound scene tours,

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and you're recording and put the cell phone in the left pocket,

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
put the eye river in the right pocket,

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but that sounds kind of weird though,

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that's not something that really I guess should happen.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But before warned, that's what's going on.

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's kind of fun in the UK today.

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's Red Nose Day,

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and I don't know if you've heard of this.

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's affiliated with Comic Relief,

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
oh, this is those birds.

350
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And not just on television,

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
which really does drive it.

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They've been ramping up to this day

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
for the past couple weeks,

354
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and celebrities doing a version of pop idols,

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and just everyone kind of really good fun,

356
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and just everyone kind of pitching in.

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can tell that people are really into it,

358
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and they're really surpassing their boundaries

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
of what they normally might do on television

360
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
because it is for a good cause, and it's for kids.

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And you can purchase these red noses

362
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
at different stores, Saintsbury is one,

363
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
where we do a lot of our grocery shopping,

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and people are wearing them.

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Right, you know, you drive by the gas station,

366
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
they might be wearing two red antennae headset balls,

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
kind of, you know, like the Martian balls,

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
whether it be red with red noses on top,

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
or that actually have a red nose, or a red nose pin.

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And it's just really cool.

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And tonight is the big grand finale.

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And I guess there's a big TV show

373
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
to go with that or whatever,

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and you still kind of get the feel here

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
when something, you know,

376
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
a big Saturday night or Friday night show

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
is on the BBC, that a lot of people are watching.

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, shoot, what time is it?

379
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
603. Oh, man. Oh, damn.

380
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, Christina is, I just remembered Christina's out,

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and she's not coming home until later,

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
in Patricia and I have dinner reservations at 6.30.

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay, so I'll just be able to make this before,

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
oh, man, I gotta get dressed.

385
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I look like shit, I gotta be here.

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, well, then let me just move on quickly

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to Michael Jackson, but following the news.

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Man, I just want to say again,

389
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
you know, what people are saying is one thing

390
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and what the evidence will be is another,

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and I still have a hard time believing

392
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
what's being suggested,

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and the press is just using this and having a feel day,

394
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and is really, really, really not giving you any information

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that I think is anywhere near the truth,

396
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
so we just really gotta be careful.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tim, you know, more importantly,

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you know, let justice take its course,

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
which it will, I believe in the justice system.

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It should also work for entertainers like Michael Jackson,

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
but his life is tiring, you know, right now,

402
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and I can feel a little bit of his pain,

403
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and it's definitely, you know,

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it would give me a headache and make me throw up

405
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
all day too, believe me.

406
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But justice will take its course,

407
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and you know, let's just lay off a little bit

408
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
on all the name calling, you know,

409
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
even just saying wacko, jacko, which is so easy,

410
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
you know, but there is a guy behind that,

411
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and there is a family and friends,

412
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and it does hurt, it really does.

413
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So, backslash on rant.

414
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Now let's listen to a cool little podcast

415
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I ran across the other day.

416
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Behind the scenes, February 14th, 2000,

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
listen to the opening.

418
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We don't need no stinking transmittance.

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Love that.

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's behind the scenes,

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
an inside look at what it takes

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to put together a podcast

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and make it work.

424
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Check it out.

425
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So basically, this is a podcast

426
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you want to subscribe to if you're new to this scene.

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's a great package,

428
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and welcome back.

429
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's a great thing to request for a 20 minute edition

430
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
of Behind the Scenes.

431
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's Monday, February 14th, 2005,

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and I have to tell you there is no love

433
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
in the air tonight, at least not when it comes down to.

434
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And you'll have to listen to the show to find out why.

435
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's almost like the Craig Patchett show,

436
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
but that's okay.

437
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But that is a cool podcast.

438
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's behind the scenes,

439
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and this was indeed the show about the RIA.

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Listen to the next videos talking about it.

441
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The legalities of music in podcasts

442
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
as you're going to find out over the next

443
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
20, 30, or who knows how many minutes of this show.

444
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I have spent a lot of time this week

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
researching the legalities of music in podcasts.

446
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You know what's cool?

447
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's now I can really regulate the volume

448
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
of these podcasts and these promos

449
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and the stuff comes in too hot or too low.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can really crank it up.

451
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And the compressor does a lot of work.

452
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So yeah, yeah, I'm totally liking it.

453
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Okay, let's do this then.

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Let's get started.

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's get started.

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's get started.

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's get started.

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Thank you.

459
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm still a little bit tired for the hit test.

460
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I mean, it's bright, right?

461
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm right.

462
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey Adam, pay Adam this is Craig Shumaker

463
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
from the Polymorphic podcast.

464
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, okay, right.

465
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In order to keep you on your toes,

466
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yann and I come up with a twist for the hit test for you.

467
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Uh-oh.

468
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
As an alumni of Headbangers Ball,

469
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you'll be able to recognize these songs by their guitar cell.

470
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, no.

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Now it shouldn't be too hard as they're all hair metal bands

472
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and they've charted with these singles.

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm so scared.

474
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Number one.

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't know because our cell is.

476
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, no, no, no.

477
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Oh, man.

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Woo!

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's definitely a Friday hit test.

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But, uh...

481
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Number two.

482
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Where's Michael Butler when you're here?

483
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Where's Michael Butler on?

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
A number three.

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah.

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh man, fuck good.

487
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh no way.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Are you ready?

489
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Here's the answer.

490
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
No, no, no, no.

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Number one.

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Straight.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm gonna turn it down.

494
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I want to hear it right now.

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay, I didn't.

496
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's pretend I didn't hear anything.

497
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh my, second.

498
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Um, like, I was moving my windows around

499
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
through the VNC connection and got really slow

500
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,500
I'm really slow and I'm like trying to stop the hit test from playing and it won't stop.

501
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,000
But now I've got my Skype window just, okay, here we go, stop.

502
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Good, I see that Michael butt goes online.

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,500
Let's see if we can get him on the Skype, he'll be able to do this.

504
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I know he will, hold on.

505
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
I've got to hit this button here so that my microphone will play through to him, hold on.

506
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,000
Come on buddy, be home.

507
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Skype says he's there.

508
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Come on.

509
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
I need him now.

510
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,500
You know, I gotta say I'm the guy that always has my Skype on a way.

511
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Even though I'm here, I just sit here clicking windows, closed and rejecting them.

512
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Ah, he's out there.

513
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Ah, shoes.

514
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
That's a bummer.

515
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Oh man.

516
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna keep it though.

517
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I'm not gonna play this hit test.

518
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I want to keep that one from Michael Butler.

519
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I want to do that with him.

520
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Let's play this kind of weird mashup that I found instead.

521
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,500
So more hit test after the weekend and we'll do it with Michael Butler.

522
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
We used to stay all the way.

523
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,500
About all the way around in the grave.

524
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,500
And I know when you lost that.

525
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,500
But I just had to learn that.

526
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,500
You lose my time in the past.

527
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Didn't know that I could find the change.

528
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Ground up on your skin and the sweat.

529
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
She is facing her.

530
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Nobody will need to join me in the world.

531
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Oh!

532
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Oh! Oh!

533
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Oh! My name is Bob.

534
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Ghalf.

535
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
I don't believe in it.

536
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
But

537
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
I just have to frame your head.

538
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
The shot never came.

539
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,500
crowd of people turn away

540
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,500
but I just had to do everything

541
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I know time

542
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I know time

543
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:52,500
but I just had to do everything

544
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,500
I know time

545
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,500
I know time

546
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I know time

547
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,500
I know time

548
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I know time

549
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:34,500
I know time

550
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I know time

551
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,220
So my favorite movie of all times Willy Wonka's Charlie and the chocolate factory.

552
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,940
Oh, I love that movie.

553
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,460
Okay, so I gotta go because there you go.

554
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,220
I'm getting Skype from downstairs now.

555
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,860
I have to shave, I have to do my hair, which of course I'm taking these long as it

556
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
used to.

557
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,660
Hold on, now it's Ron, hold on, let me just tell him I'm going out for, yeah, get a kick out

558
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
of this.

559
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,740
Oh, that's like, is that working?

560
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
Yeah.

561
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,980
Hey, Ron, I'm recording the show.

562
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,380
Yeah, I just saw you nailing with him.

563
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,980
Like I'm recording you now.

564
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Hey.

565
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
Okay, hey.

566
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,580
So anyway, I gotta go out, Patricia and I are having dinner and we're having sushi

567
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,180
so I gotta run, but, um, talk to you later?

568
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:31,260
Yeah, this makes sure you get the cook stuff because, uh, something fishy about it.

569
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
Okay, my mom.

570
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,060
Okay, I'm a lot of goto.

571
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Talk to you later.

572
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Bye.

573
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
Okay.

574
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,980
Oh, shit, I could have done the, the test with him too, with the rocks on his ass shit,

575
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
whatever.

576
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Okay.

577
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,700
Dude, I, I, I do, and do that.

578
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,340
I promise you, I will, uh, hold on, see, do you hear that I'm getting Skype messages

579
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
now?

580
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
It's distracting me.

581
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
I should shut Skype off.

582
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I'm doing this, really.

583
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,020
I promise you, over the weekend, I'll get a hold of Michael, uh, Butler, Rock and

584
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,260
Will Geek, and we'll definitely get him to do the hit test because that's should

585
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,700
that'll be a, uh, who would, I mean, I'll never know, but he should certainly know

586
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,020
at least some of them, right?

587
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,820
So that's it for the source code, little shorter than normal.

588
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,620
I'll work on the door.

589
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,500
But only by 11 or 12 minutes.
