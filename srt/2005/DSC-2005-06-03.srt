00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Daily source code episode 187

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,560
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
or you can hear since radio is invented.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,120
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,320
or nothing to say.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,920
It's $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,720
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,160
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,360
Hey everybody, coming to you from Curry Cottage in Gilford, UK at the source code.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
And today is June 3rd, 2005.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
My name's Adam Curry and it's Friday.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Oh yes, and it couldn't be more beautiful today.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,760
Everything I missed coming back yesterday or the day before with all the crappy weather.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,280
It's back, we got sunshine and 75 degrees.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
I always put me in the mood for a show.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
I got a lot of stuff for you today and we may be interrupted because,

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,960
well, basically all the logistics at the cottage are messed up.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
Let's see, this morning we had the plumber come by because our hot water was all filed up,

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,120
which means that I waited for hours before being able to take a shower and then I had a cold shower.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,680
I was always there.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,480
Somewhere to be now in the next 20 minutes, the blinds guys should show up.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,600
Blinds, not blinds, they're going to hang up blinds to darken the bedroom.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,120
Something I've been begging for.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,120
I just can't sleep when it's too light in the bedroom, so finally got those guys square

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,400
away and maybe even today, the carpeted guys will show up.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,000
Wouldn't that just be part for the corset?

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Oh man, we got promos, we got some pod save music for you.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,480
Let's see, pod save music from the Netherlands actually, so that should be fun.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
I've got a couple of notes here.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,440
I do have the remote microphone standing by in case the guys show up and we'll just continue

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,920
to show, I don't want to stop in midstream.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,320
Maybe you'll just follow along and we'll enjoy the blinds guys together.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,280
And as I was looking for a cool mashup to play, we're kind of low on the mashups.

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
You know, please feel free to send some in at mashup at podshow.com.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
I figured I'd pull an old one out of the closet one that actually came across, so just while

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm muckin' around on the iPod, I guess I put it on shuffle and low on behold this one showed up.

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
If the Beatles vs. Shaggy, let it be me.

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh, you figured I'd pull an old one, so you'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along and we'll just follow along

43
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
wonderful email in that said, you know, you really should free up some space on your hard

44
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,840
disk for the PowerBook G4, which I did. I sent me a great little application called What

45
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,560
Size. You can find that on version tracker. And I use that and basically it scans your entire

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
drive, color codes, all the files on it and folders so you can see where all the big stuff

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,800
is and easily delete it. So I freed up about seven gigabytes. So now supposedly you're supposed

48
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
to have at least 10 gigabytes free on your Mac if you're using OS 10 for swap files and stuff

49
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
like that, which makes a lot of sense and I thought that would basically remove all the problems,

50
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,240
but I still hear some skipping. And so I blame that on on the C yesterday and I immediately got a

51
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,520
response in in the form of audio feedback. Hi Adam, it's Dave Brightbill from Radio MacGuys at

52
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,760
www.mackguys.com. And I'm sending you this audio feedback and response to the comments you made

53
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,640
on your last podcast about Lucy Hardrives. And let me start out by saying that as far as I know,

54
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Lucy does not manufacture any hard drives. What they do is they have manufactured for them,

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:21,360
some empty cases and these cases have the FireWire to ATA interface and they have the

56
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,000
the power supply and they have some jacks for the power and some jacks for firewire or USB to

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,440
money and what kind of drive it is. And that's the part that Lucy supplies and probably what's failed

58
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,440
and years now if you're if your case failed that's one thing and I'd be happy to put the blame on

59
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Lucy if that's the case, but probably the hard drive itself failed and that's not Lucy's fault.

60
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,120
That's the fault of the manufacturer of the hard drive and hard drives normally have their own

61
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
warranties on them. So if you've had a hard drive fail you need to find out who manufactured the hard

62
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,840
drive in that Lucy case and contact that manufacturer and you know so you hold on a second.

63
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,560
That sounds like horseshit to me. I mean if I buy a car and there's a German electronic system

64
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,040
and it buy Bosch and that fails I have to go find out who made that and go and go talk to them.

65
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,240
That makes no sense at all. And by the way it's not so much about the fact that the

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,880
drives are failing it's the way let's see handles it. Although say as well we'll just give you

67
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,800
new one. They don't even want to try to fix it. They don't even want to try to recover your data.

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
I mean I feel that if you're saying this is a great drive and to me the drive is the case.

69
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,720
You know it's the case and the plugs and the lights etc. And I don't know what the hell is on the

70
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
inside. We have to break it open and find out. I'm sorry I have to disagree with this opinion.

71
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,520
So you nasty things about them if you want to but I don't think you should say those things

72
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,520
that's certainly about Lucy. Now I'm not an employee of a sea. I'm not a stockholder. I don't know

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
a whole lot about them currently. I know I had one time I was a Peter reseller and an Apple reseller

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,200
and during those days I actually would sometimes sell the sea products but I've used them a lot

75
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,960
in my own practice and a lot of my clients have their products and you know all hard drives fail.

76
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,200
That's the thing. I understand that a whole hard drives fail but

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
not you know listen I was going to tell me that I have to back up. What's I back up on?

78
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,840
Another hard drive? Hard drives are complex mechanical mechanisms and they have a moving

79
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,400
motors moving at high speeds. They have bearings. They have lubrication. They have all sorts of

80
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,200
mechanics. Yeah don't dribble up lubrication too. You know. Cancle parts they can fail and so they're

81
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,600
going to fail. I mean it's just going to happen. There's no there's no two ways about it. And as a

82
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,800
wise computer user what you have to do is you have to figure out how to protect your data and

83
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,280
you do that by backing up. And I know you know about it. There it is. You got to back up.

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,160
All right. Now I know I have 10 of these 60 gigalcy hard drives and I think six of them have failed

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,560
within a two-year period. That can't be normal and I've heard other people have the same problems.

86
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,800
And by the way it's not always the drive. It's also the it's what you call it's the interface.

87
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,480
It's the plug somehow you know something there that can fry and they won't even replace that

88
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
you know they'll say well you we can give you another drive and then you can do it yourself.

89
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,040
It's just I'm sorry it's just it's not cutting it. Let's see has not done a good job by me.

90
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,360
So just call it an official customer complaint that's all. And as you were you know anything like that

91
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,160
but you've been so helpful to me and in learning about podcasts I wanted to get back to you

92
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,080
and give you some advice on how to how to keep your your life saying much appreciated hard drives go.

93
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,280
So much appreciated. Remember like I say in every podcast and every podcast of mine with this I always say

94
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,760
there's two kinds of computer users in this world those who have lost data and those who will.

95
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,640
So back up early and back up often. Thank you. You know we actually have a saying an aviation.

96
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,200
There's two types of pilots those that have made a wheels up landing and those that really

97
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
they that I'm going to have a great great day. Thank you David. I really appreciate the feedback that's

98
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,720
Adam Curry dot com for your audio feedback. Adam Curry's pod shell greetings welcome to this

99
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,880
that there goes again there's my lucid drive failing. I love a stick in your ear.

100
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,280
This is Darcy and Holly show coming to you live from two different countries.

101
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
WWW dot Darcy and Holly dot com.

102
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,800
Hi this is our promo for the Darcy and Holly show. I'm Darcy.

103
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,600
Emily. And yes we do a podcast. We do a podcast on the Darcy and Holly show as you've

104
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,960
gathered and kind of just talk about stuff. Basically yeah. Stream of consciousness that's the

105
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,640
name of our game. Right because as the intro said we're in two different countries doing the whole internet

106
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,480
long distance relationship thing and so since we're on the phone all the time anyway we decided to

107
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,520
just podcast podcast it like that whatever conversations more than one actually through the

108
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:11,680
night so yeah so so that's what we're about and we're doing something different starting in June

109
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,840
a little bit different. It's a same sort of idea but there's a kind of a theme

110
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,080
in a really head of theme. Yeah because I'm going to go dark school with a toilet blind

111
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,280
and I'm going to go dark school starting June fifth and so we thought you would podcast make

112
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,440
experience so because I wanted to journal of it anyway so I thought why not just do audio and podcast

113
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
it. Yeah and we figured out people might interested. A lot of people would be interested anyway

114
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,960
because even if you're not blind the way blindness is portrayed in the media isn't always all that

115
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,440
accurate so we thought this would be kind of cool. And that's about thought so if you like dogs then you might

116
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
like like yeah but we're also going to be doing other stuff too so it's not interested in that.

117
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,760
Yeah so if you hate dogs then you should it's really anyway. Yeah he's going to be keeping me up

118
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,920
today as what's going on in the podcast you're going to be totally cut off. Yeah because they have

119
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,560
dealt with in the lecture so that's not so much what's dealt with in the podcast. Right. So I'm going to

120
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,920
be cut off so he's going to be keeping me up today so people get all of your kinds of things.

121
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah and if you want to listen to our website www.darsianholly.com which is www.tarcyand.coly.com

122
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,960
Yosuh. Okay so the blind casters do check in today. Gotta love that. Actually I was just

123
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:35,040
sitting here thinking for a second I wanted to know let me see NBA.com can I? I want to see how

124
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,640
the Miami Heat did yesterday. As the conference is heating up I haven't seen a skinny on sports yet

125
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,040
usually those guys always have a good take on on the games and a good handle on what's going on.

126
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,920
Let me see Heat handle piston so I guess that means good news hold on a second.

127
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,600
Okay so Miami beat Detroit but what did then what was the score? Oh man.

128
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Oh here we go. Heat handle piston so let me say oh that's a video I'm not going to

129
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,440
see the video I don't subscribe to that. Okay well all right so they beat him but uh oh

130
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,440
could 88 to 76 right on go heat loving that and the reason why is because I happen to have a friend

131
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
who I see in tickets. So hopefully the final game will be played in Miami then maybe I can

132
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,840
actually go and check it out. Okay let's see um I don't want a couple of things that I've got an

133
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,080
excellent piece of match Weinstein for that I want to share with you we'll have that in just a second.

134
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,400
Also there was some comments left yesterday on um in the on the show notes at curie.com

135
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,480
by someone called the comic strip blogger and I guess that's the same guy who's mobile phone fan

136
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,920
but you know despite the fact that mobile phone fan is somewhat peculiar in his postings and

137
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,680
and the stuff that he says and that he post on his own weblog the comic strips he does are just

138
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:05,360
fantastic and uh there's an RSS feed for it so you really should subscribe to that comic strip blogger

139
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,040
uh I'll provide a link in the show notes but uh he's really um I mean this is you know mobile phone

140
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,040
fan comic strip blogger wherever you are you've missed your calling dude you know you shouldn't be

141
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,640
post your art is completely there now I understand what you should be doing do more of those that

142
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,800
is absolutely phenomenal um you know he picks up stuff from the blogger sphere the potters sphere and

143
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,880
and creates little three or four paying cartoons about them and that just fantastic so uh give that

144
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,240
one a check uh one else that I have probably well I was listening to a couple about oh the CC

145
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,160
Chapman had a great uh uh accident hash podcast the mellow hash should check that one how it is

146
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,960
truly mellow and there's some great songs coming out just phenomenal this pot-safe music stuff

147
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,080
the the quality and did I tell you that um if I did tell you when when when I met with Steve Jobs

148
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,560
he was when you were talking about about pot-safe music I guess the iTunes music store now

149
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,640
hosts and sells 11,000 different tracks that are independent music um and you know we're talking

150
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,520
about you know what what is really the difference now between the pros and the non-prose you know

151
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,760
I don't know when we call an amateurs um and we both agree that there really isn't that much

152
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,280
difference particularly because Mick Jagger had uh had called him as of course Mick does he usually

153
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,400
call Steve as on on the weekends and uh and said you know that he was using garage band

154
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,400
apples multi-track recording application for recording some tracks for the next you know

155
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,760
whatever the stones are doing and I think you man you know all that we need now is just you know

156
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,160
the way to identify and and promote talent and get them out and let people know about it and that

157
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,840
is exactly what I hope we can do with the the pot-safe music network to be released very very soon

158
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,360
just to let you know most retrieval is back

189
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,440
and I don't know what magic was thinking because this to me is actually I have to say

190
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,800
some of it is the best of magic maybe maybe that's the whole that was the whole point of this but

200
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:28,640
I think pretty thought so as to invite the greatest goddess into our room think of lavender and

201
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,840
color lily paintings picture yourself taking a bath with epsom salts surrounded by a favorite

202
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:44,560
very nice wide homemade candles and your cats oh my I think it's working I sense the

oceans warm fills my groin and my breasts yes now the goddess is here and she is ready to speak

204
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:06,720
through me hi I'm Mad Weinstein by now you've all probably seen those silly yellow silicon

205
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,280
lands Armstrong bracelets haven't you well if you haven't figured it all out then let me explain

206
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,640
it to you very clearly you see here in americant we don't get health insurance provided for us

207
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,560
we get DVD players desperate housewives and iPods instead as a result we americants

208
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,920
have conceived of a very novel approach to fighting disease we wear ugly jewelry and accessories

209
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,840
you heard me ugly jewelry when was the last time you saw a pink breast cancer ribbon that was

210
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,880
tasteful looking huh and the t-shirts don't even get me started on the t-shirts if I see one more

211
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,640
suburban mallet bearing closeted lesbow waddling around with her love handles bursting outside

212
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,720
of her ridiculously tight avon three day walk against breast cancer t-shirt I may have to go on

213
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,240
a side and then they have to wear those fucking family packs with the water bottles strapped to

214
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
their fat asses who the hell gave these bitches the idea that they need to slip three gallons

215
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,800
of water around with them during the one lunar eclipse they decide to go move their fat asses out

216
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,720
of their goddamn hog and dogs stained couches give me a break these women haven't

217
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,240
have enough water in their asses to drown a camel and don't even get me started on the lunar

218
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,280
bars oh and those ribbons ever since the days of Jimmy Carter and the Irene hostage business

219
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,800
we americants have been obsessed with those horrible flimsy broaches is there a color that has

220
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:49,920
not yet been used I don't think so but those yellow bracelets are really what put me over the edge

221
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,160
first I saw my spin teacher wearing one over at the cheetah gym and I couldn't figure out

222
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,280
why in other wise fashion conscious gay man would want to adorn himself with certain ugly

223
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,280
piece of garbage then I started seeing co-work as wearing them wait watches were wearing them

224
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,480
my herbalist my acupuncturist my yoga teacher and even my holistic goddess worship

225
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,560
cabala therapist was wearing one so I looked it up on the internet and found that those bracelets

226
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,760
are inscribed with the words live strong on them and they serve as a means to tell the world proudly

227
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
I stand against campsite

228
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
hi Adam my name is Braden and I'm aura and we're the home theater guys the host of the

229
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,320
HD TV podcast we talk about all the latest news and high definition television and home theater

230
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,680
we also do product and technology reviews informative how-to's and answer listener questions

231
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,200
but we need to ask for your listeners help you see we have a dream yes it's a dream that

232
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,840
one day all the original MTV content will be re-blocked and high definition you know all those original

233
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,640
MTV DJs some of the most attractive people to ever grace the small screen

234
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,600
forget aliens yes I or even Monday night football we need the top 20 countdown

235
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,600
and if we can just get enough people screaming I want my HD MTV we may have a chance

236
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,880
remember the days when music television actually played music and at the glory days

237
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,440
and boy were those VJ's talent or what for more information visit our website at www

238
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:38,240
htguys.com next for your support okay you know a lot of people say that to me oh man

239
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,680
MTV doesn't play music anymore but you know their business those guys they noticed I think the

240
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,200
first time they noticed that long-form programming which is you know like shows was with remote

241
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,560
control remember that with Ken Ober and Kari were and Colin that was a great show and that

242
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,800
pulled in tremendous ratings for MTV at least because MTV I think used to get on average from

243
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:05,280
music programming but like a 0.5 or yeah probably on average is 0.5 rating and they started to hit

244
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:14,080
double digits so the one well I guess full single digits 1.0 and 1.1 and 1.2's on shows like remote control

245
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,320
and like any business you know the more they could get the more they could get more viewers more money

246
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,080
basically higher rate cards so it morphed but you know let's not forget that MTV has been around

247
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,880
for over 25 years now 25 years and when I scan through the music channel through the channels on

248
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,440
my TV here or in the States it's plenty of music being played all over the place and

249
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:48,400
to my name Barbara I love a coffee yeah yeah oh the way wonderful a little bit of cream and sugar

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,360
Matt's Today in History.

269
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:31,480
Uh-huh, I love that. That's a great podcast. I'll put a link to the podcast site and show notes.

270
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,600
Of course, in my own show notes at DaddySourceco.com and query.com. Oh, man. So this weekend, I guess

271
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,040
we're going to try, as I told you yesterday, we're going to try and catch a show at London's

272
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,480
West End. Um, you know, if you have a way to get tickets for a good, I think we want to go to

273
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,720
like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or something like that. If you have a way to get tickets easily,

274
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,000
if I can order them online, I haven't really done a lot of research, but I figured there's

275
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,200
enough people in the UK listening who could probably help me out, that would be much appreciated.

276
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,760
Uh, let's see, PodSafe Music. This is, I told you's going to play a, uh, a Dutch band.

277
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,800
The name is Silence is Sexy. And, uh, we actually played this on the Pod show on series.

278
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,680
It's got a lot of cool response to it. They've played at the infamous parody, so an Amsterdam

279
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,720
and nighttime in Rotterdam. No, the place is very well. Here's reptiles on the source code.

280
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:46,760
How much does it take to think the world out of this?

281
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Seller, we left with all the extra pets.

282
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:02,760
You're leaving me so much there.

283
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,760
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

284
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:18,040
We are in class. The sun weighs away. We space to let it shine. The sun's bright.

285
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,760
And don't you try to have your,

286
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:36,760
let me have it in another run.

287
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Some stay alive and feel like proud of you.

288
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:54,360
Are those wouldn't make a ribbon in the sky yet?

289
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:10,200

sense sale mentions in the show I'm not sponsored or paid by sense sale at all I'm

294
