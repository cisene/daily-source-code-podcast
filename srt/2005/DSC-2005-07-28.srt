1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Delta share a Charlie 216.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,840
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,200
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,840
radio is invented.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,520
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,520
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,520
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,520
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,520
The date is July 28, 2005.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
This is your daily source code.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Hey everybody, how you doing?

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,520
It is human.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,520
That's what you know, I always like to give you the weather report the beginning of the show.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
It's nice and humid today.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,520
Got the Converre Rollin here throwing more humidity into the air, but at least it's cool air, right?

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
As opposed to a dry heat.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Hey, let's do a source code.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm ready.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Actually, I'm far from ready.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,520
I just kind of threw some stuff together and said, you know, fuck it.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Hit record.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Let's go.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Which is always my favorite kind of show.

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Kind of gives that feel like I used to have on the radio where you got to start, right?

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
You, you can't do any more preparation.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,520
You've got to start when the time rolls around, so I kind of have to self impose starting time.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,520
I've got to play some pod safe music for you.

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,520
I've got some cool audio feedback that I wanted to share.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,520
And I finally did it.

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,520
I hit 100% on Gmail.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,520
I guess I have to stop soliciting audio feedback as attachments.

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
That's just not working for me.

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:51,520
So, so much for my theory that Gmail is actually looking at my account to see if it's time to add some into the infinity plus one pod.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Well, it's actually funny because you can go over your 100% allotment on incoming.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,520
It'll actually go to 101 or 102%.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,520
But then if you reply, it won't let you reply.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
I'll tell you that you've gone over your code.

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,520
So, I did something I really hate to do, but I went in and I trashed a couple of attachments.

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,520
I trashed the backtracks podcast and a couple of hit tests.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I hate that.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I hate that.

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
But okay.

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Hey, ain't that big of a deal.

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
I'm still loving Gmail.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,520
It's still the way for me to manage my information as best as possible.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Current count, 7,234 unread messages and not quite too pro.

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Alrighty, got a mashup that I pulled off of mashuptown.com.

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Just to get into the vibe, I really love this.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,520
It's notorious trick on the source code.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,520
I've paid my dues for all that I've done.

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
And I showed you that I loved you more than once.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,520
They have nothing left that to decide.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
So do you eat my trick, me once.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
I won't let you trick me twice.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,520
We don't know what they're always doing.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
They don't feel like always doing.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
We're having an unhappy day.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,520
They didn't even want to wait the time.

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
They don't let you trick me twice.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,520
They won't let you trick me twice.

They won't let you trick me twice.

63
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
They won't let you trick me twice.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

They didn't even want to be worse.

255
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

256
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

257
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

258
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

259
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

260
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

261
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

262
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

263
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
They didn't even want to be worse.

264
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,520
And released or anything like that, which is such a shame.

265
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,520
That just proves why the pod save music network is becoming such a huge success.

266
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:10,520
By the way, do you hear about this about the Sony $10 million fine they had to pay for the pay for play?

267
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,520
This is Eliot Spitzer in New York, the General Attorney General I should say.

268
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,520
I guess he sued them or took them into court or whatever.

269
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Lots of people are asking me, you know, well, we used to call this payola, right?

270
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
And it was supposed to be over.

271
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,520
And let me tell you, this is, it never went away.

272
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
This has been going on for years.

273
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,520
But it's not like this jockies are being paid everything or anything at all because

274
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
This jockies don't even choose the music that's played.

275
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,520
This is done between program directors, music directors, and it's done by something

276
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
called independent promoters primarily.

277
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,520
I don't want to, you know, pay anyone black here, but, you know, that's actually a Dutch expression

278
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
that may have come out wrong.

279
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
But it happens with all kinds of things.

280
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,520
You know, it's, I don't think there's actually a bribe involved or, you know, everyone has a deal with

281
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,520
They say, okay, I'll play this song or I'll put it into rotation if you pay me X.

282
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:14,520
But it happens with, you know, okay, concert tickets, fun rides, you know, a trip, stuff like that.

283
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
And it's been going on forever.

284
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,520
And that's exactly how the music industry has worked.

285
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
This is exactly how it's worked.

286
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
It's no surprise whatsoever.

287
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,520
And they consume every single radio station that plays music in the United States.

288
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,520
New music that is, because I don't think it really, I don't think you can attribute

289
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
that to stations that play oldies.

290
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,520
But, you know, really, it's a part of the new music marketing machine.

291
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
And it's just the way it works.

292
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,520
And it varies from very simply innocent stuff like, hey, you know, we promised that, you know,

293
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,520
X will come to visit your station and come on the morning show if you add the record.

294
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
MTV has been doing this for years.

295
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
You know, it's like, yeah, Michael Jackson.

296
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I've been a part of these deals where he'll perform on the video, musical,

297
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
he'll perform on the video, musical awards.

298
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,520
If you do a Michael Jackson weekend, you know, when he coincidentally has a new record out.

299
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
I mean, this, this stuff has always been there.

300
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
It's the way it works.

301
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Which is why I like the podcast music network because there is no pay for play involved in here.

302
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,520
I mean, I guess technically you could happen.

303
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,520
But first of all, people could be up front about it.

304
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
You know, and there's no laws against it.

305
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,520
But it's not that exciting because what we're doing was we're playing stuff.

306
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,520
We'd like and we're playing stuff that other people are playing the game's traction.

307
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
So it's much more fair.

308
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,520
And if you check out the podcast, music network, I can't promote this enough,

309
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,520
because it really is working and it's fantastic.

310
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,520
You know, we have now the promotion for songs.

311
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,520
We have a place that we can send listeners of podcasts back to to learn more about the band.

312
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,520
And you can pretty soon we're going to open up the store.

313
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,520
So you can buy it directly online when you get to the podcast music network.

314
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
That's music dot pod show dot com.

315
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Oh, if you want to remember that way, or pod safe music network dot com,

316
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,520
which is a little bit more typing, but it's, it can also remember it.

317
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,520
And I want to go through some of the Gmail here that I've been receiving.

318
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Thomas Jeffrey sent me an email. He said he called his brother who works for TSA.

319
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,520
And the only lock that he knows of that they have the master key for is the travel century line of locks.

320
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
And this is interesting.

321
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,520
He said, if your lock isn't one of these, then you might have gotten ripped off by a company selling you something

322
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
under the guys of being TSA accessible.

323
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Well, let me tell you, the airport is full of locks that are TSA accessible.

324
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,520
This was sold to me as a part of a to me, which is a very expensive suitcase.

325
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,520
They have like 800 bucks for this suitcase, which is supposed to be indestructible by the way.

326
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
And so far so good.

327
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,520
And it had big white TSA letters on it.

328
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
TSA key number 002.

329
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
You know, it can't be more clear than that.

330
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
I've traveled with it several times without an issue.

331
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,520
But I think that, you know, some guys are just like snip happy, you know.

332
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Let me snip something.

333
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,520
So of course I don't know if there's any other branding on the lock because it's been cut off

334
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
and it's gone.

335
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
But I do know that, you know, they're expensive.

336
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,520
And I know that the price of this bag was expensive and that the lock was definitely a part of the price.

337
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:15,520
So Tom, I'm not sure what it was, but if it says TSA 002, that would pretty much mean it's a TSA lock.

338
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Has a special, it's a combination lock, but it's a special place.

339
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
We can insert the TSA key.

340
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,520
And, you know, somewhere there's something being scammed.

341
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
So I'd love to know more about that.

342
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,520
If anyone can point to an online resource, a travel centri apparently and that's a travel

343
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,520
centri.org has the only real official locks according to Tom and his brother.

344
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
So be on the lookout for scams in that regard.

345
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
It doesn't really, it does bother me.

346
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I don't mind people going through my shit.

347
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,520
You know, I understand that and it's all from my protections well.

348
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
So that makes sense.

349
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
But I want it to be locked up, you know.

350
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
So I'm playing the game fairly because how many times have been ripped off because airport employees

351
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
have been able to get into my bag?

352
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,520
You know, that's a problem.

353
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,520
So that said, I'm sure I'll get lots of email about that.

354
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,520
And who knows, they will come up with some real information, something we can

355
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,520
can use because I'm sure a lot of people are going through these issues.

356
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Daily source code, audio, feedback.

357
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Hi Adam.

358
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
I don't know what the British told you.

359
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I didn't catch that podcast, but there are a few little details about the highway

360
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,520
numbering system that we need to get straight out.

361
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:31,520
One is that, yes, it was a plan conceived and started by President Eisenhower,

362
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,520
but interesting to note that the main purpose of it was

363
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:45,520
stated to be for expedient movement of military vehicles and troops and for evacuation of the citizens.

364
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Remember that this whole idea was brought together during those fun fill days of the Cold War,

365
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,520
and we all had global thermonuclear war a little bit more to the forefront of our minds.

366
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Anyway, don't confuse US highway numbers with interstate highway numbers.

367
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,520
US one, in fact, is on the east coast.

368
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
But the other things that you point out are pretty much true that the odd number

369
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:18,520
of interstates run north and south, and they start the numbering from the west coast to the east coast.

370
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,520
So I find runs up and down the west coast and I 95 runs up and down the east coast,

371
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,520
and that the even numbered ones are run east to west.

372
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I tend to be in a long the bottom and I 94 go across the top.

373
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,520
But it's useful to think of them more in terms of running south to north and west to east,

374
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,520
because that's the way the mile marker numbers run.

375
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,520
As soon as you cross over a state border going from the south to the north,

376
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,520
the numbering starts again at one, and similarly going from west to east,

377
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,520
when you cross over a state border and the mile marker numbers restart at every state line,

378
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
you'll start at mile marker one.

379
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,520
So if you were to drive there from California over to Las Vegas,

380
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,520
as soon as you would cross over the state line in Nevada,

381
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
you'd see mile marker number one.

382
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,520
And while I have you, I want to wish you the half of the rest of the 100 million gathering

383
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,520
marchers and a really, really big thank you for all the hard work you're doing.

384
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,520
This podcasting stuff is really great, and all this techno stuff is just cool.

385
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,520
So there, I'm stronger Jim and the big blue 18 wheeler and that's the view for my left seat.

386
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Thanks a lot at him, bye-bye.

387
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Hi Joe, content that will make you walk the job and kiss your mother.

388
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,520
So what I wanted there really was another fun field history fact about the USA young

389
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
the daily source code.

390
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Cool man, from the 18 wheeler, rockin' really appreciated.

391
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
That's very, very cool.

392
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm warning some geek stuff coming up,

393
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
I want to talk about bandwidth again.

394
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
So do you hear that, by the way, this crackling?

395
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
I think I've overused my mixer hole on.

396
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
It was crack, there it is.

397
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I guess the microphone fader is, there it goes, shit.

398
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,520
I got to get some of that spray stuff and that basically means the end of the mixer.

399
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
But they're so cheap these days.

400
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,520
What I pay for this mixer, like 150 bucks or something like that.

401
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,520
And I have to get another set up for the condo, the Corri condo and San Francisco.

402
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Yeah, it's going to be basically one big recording studio.

403
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Patricia said something funny today.

404
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,520
She said, you know, for the fridge used to have some bottled water always there and some bottles of champagne.

405
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
It's like bottles of champagne.

406
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,520
She said, well, yeah, you know, that's what, that's what every condo should have.

407
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I was like, well, for who?

408
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Or it's just for me when I'm sitting there, I'm inviting all kinds of people to come on over and hang out.

409
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
I played this yesterday.

410
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
I think I got to play it a couple more times.

411
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
I just can't get it out of my head, man.

412
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
I am digging this song so much.

413
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
It's pod save music.

414
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
You can find it on the pod save music network.

415
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
It is our anthem.

416
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
And mine at least.

417
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Cruise box.

418
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,520

419
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520

No one's going to stop you telling MCC to stick it.

425
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Pick it.

426
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
The revolution is on.

427
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Do you remember?

428
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
You're the first computer.

429
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,520
That piece of shit was like a freaking rotor.

430
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Now we've got Wi-Fi.

431
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Downloading files fast.

432
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,520
This meant to everyone who's ever done on my cast.

433
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
It's just me.

434
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Now you're seeing each and every nation.

435
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
The radio is got to go.

436
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
It's our imagination.

437
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Me that song.

438
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Sing alone.

439
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
My sheet of comics.

440
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
It's a real fucking rotor.

441
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Now I'm going to fix it.

442
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,520
You're somebody here to call.

443
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,520

The revolution is on until the FCC to stick it.

466
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Kick it.

467
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Hurt it on the podcast.

468
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
That is cruise box.

469
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You can find them in music.

470
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
The podcast.

471
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520

The podcast.

475
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
And you know it's so cool about what we're doing here.

476
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
Radio in New York actually coast to coast with my syndicated show

477
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,320
Once in a while you'd receive you know a platinum record or a gold record on behalf of the you know the band

478
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,840
Thanking you for your contribution. I have a lot of them hanging up in my office because you know, it looks cool, right?

479
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
There's no doubt about it, but it's not really from the artist themselves

480
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
It's from the record company and

481
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,000
That's a part of that, you know that whole thing I was talking about concert tickets and everything is like, you know

482
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,120
Oops, oh my Mike Stan just sorry about that my Mike Stan just collapsed

483
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,760
You know, it's kind of like hey, you know, thanks for helping out and which of course means next time around Lee help us out as well

484
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,040
You know, I shall take a picture of one of them. You know, I got my my MDA here. I'll take a picture of

485
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
The one I got from arrows Smith hold on

486
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
All right, so I took a picture I'll post that up there

487
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Great, you see my reflection there, but even though I know that it's well meant and and actually when Cristina was born

488
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,040
All of Aros Smith sent a nice little no-dover and congratulated depotrition eye, but

489
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,280
I got emails from the guys from cruise box, you know, and that was really nice. They didn't have to do that

490
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,440
And you know, they're just as jazz as I am. Oops. What's this?

491
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Hold on

492
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,840
Okay, so I got that that's the me. That's my 15 minute warning. Hey, this MDA is really greatest controlling my life

493
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm totally digging it

494
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,480
Let me see, so I do the geeky thing now now I do one more audio feedback and then I'll talk some geek stuff about

495
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,400
Bandwidth. Hey Adam Mark Prince here from the coffee geek podcast and I'm sitting here in b

496

All Vancouver British Columbia listening to the daily source code as I do every day. Now here in Vancouver

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,920
I really appreciate everything you do for the community. There's a lot of lot of player haters out there

505
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,240
But I certainly am not one of them you are the pod father and I bow I'm bowing to Adam Curry

506
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,840
I know this is radio and we can't see it right now, but that's what I'm doing and I'm keep up the great work

507
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
Keep going with the daily source code keep doing what you do man

508
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,440
You got true believers out there and I really appreciate everything you do for the podcast community

509
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
No, that's so nice. Thank you very much. You can tell that I yeah

510
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,160
I found out by the way what all that cutting out is on it's not really mega-seg that is the issue

511
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
it's whenever I have a

512
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Network share on my desktop that's when

513
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,720
What happens is I think the Mac is trying to recent can make sure everything's still connected and if it's a network server somewhere

514
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,400
Then it takes a couple seconds to actually find it depending on the the connectivity and the bandwidth and all that stuff

515
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
So speaking of that here we go

516
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,280
Now whenever I talk about this issue, I get all kinds of you know a bit torrent like solutions, et cetera

517
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,480
But I you know for the people who understand bandwidth

518
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,600
For those of you that don't I I just want to talk about

519
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,960
The two there are two types of bandwidth that we need for pod casting and this has really been the epiphany that I've come up with

520
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,400
That's saved by the bell or ruined by the bell hold on

521
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Oh, I know this is home

522
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Hey, Chris

523
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,800
Hey, I'm in the middle of the source code. Can I call you right back?

524
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,440
Okay, I'll call you back in in like 20 minutes

525
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Okay, I'll call you later

526
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Bye

527
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,080
Had the phone's gonna ring again. I'm sure for my father clock anyway

528
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Two types of bandwidth

529
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,560
The the bandwidth on which pod casting was originally conceived really dealt more from the consumer side

530
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,040
And the concept was you're streaming sucks and why does streaming suck because

531
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,400
There's really not enough bandwidth primarily on the receiving end although it's gotten much better to have a full blown at the time

532
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
We're thinking of full screen experience

533
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,760
Although these days it's you know just getting an audio file you can you can pretty much get that in real time

534
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,600
So when you click on the link and you're kind of downloading it your player will automatically start playing it once it has an update

535
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,560
It to do that and it kind of figures out what's the rate of download? Yeah, I can start playing now it buffers a little bit

536
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,240
But that's almost instantaneous the idea was that even if you had a shitty connection

537
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,360
Now, of course, it's reverse because there's so many pod people who want to listen to podcasts that the the sending ban with becomes the problem

538
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
It's not a problem if

539
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:33,120
If you're subscribed to a podcast because even if it's coming in at two kilobits per second, which is definitely not enough to just to play it in real time

540
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,560
It'll get there and it may take 10 minutes or it may take 15 minutes, but it'll get there. It'll get to your computer

541
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,440
And you don't know that you're waiting for it and it doesn't hurt you because it's happening in the background

542
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,000
You know your iTunes is doing it your iPod or is doing it whatever and as long as these

543
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,520
Pod captures are smart enough that you know if the connection stops for a second to wait or if it breaks

544
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,040
It goes back and tries it again

545
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,880
It'll eventually get there that is the whole concept of originally again

546
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,360
It was from the consumer side, but now we have enough ban with we've run into another problem

547
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,800
Whereas there's so many people hitting this stuff in real time that you need you know like real time

548
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
quality bandwidth so

549
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
What you what you almost need to have is

550
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
a link for

551
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,280
For someone who wants to odd you know just browse a show and listen and say is this something that I want to listen to

552
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,760
And a separate link for someone who subscribes and it downloads slowly in the background

553
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,320
So really I'm now looking at almost a non technological fix. I'm thinking more maybe we need to

554
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,600
Have a way or it's you know change our production processes or basically change whatever link you have on your home page

555
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,040
So that high quality ban with stuff that'll deliver in real time

556
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
Is coming from a different source and

557
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,200
Over time as more people learn about the subscription process

558
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,800
It's going to get much better. So there's going to be a shift now another thing we could do is we could

559
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
For the real-time ban with we could you know people just want to find out about a show

560
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,520
We could all make promos and post those now of course the the biggest issue that we have now is iTunes because

561
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,960
Although items let you subscribe and there is a caching

562
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,520
For good or for bad there's caching of your RSS feeds which isn't a huge server load

563
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,320
What a lot of people do is say hey. Oh, this is a great podcast. They find it somewhere double-click

564
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,160
It's coming straight from your server and they want and people have come to expect a real-time full-blown experience

565
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,880
Which is getting harder to deliver not necessary that the technology isn't there, but the cost is is very high

566
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,320
So you know right now you're looking at for daily source code and an average cost of 30 cents per person who listens to this in real time

567
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,680
Now you don't want to blow off your listeners by not providing a way for them to get it immediately

568
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,320
But there's all you know, there's a social change that we have to go through either that or maybe the direct links would be bit torn only

569
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,280
You know, so I'm working through all these issues. That's actually what my five o'clock phone call is about so

570
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
There's a lot of stuff to think about there

571
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,600
One thing I know for sure is that what we can't do we can't reverse engineered and say oh, you know

572
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,120
Put a helper app in or you know even bit torn has has drawbacks. It really does because

573
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,200
inherently and this has been explained to me by people much smarter and much more knowledgeable than I am certainly on this topic

574
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,520
It's not that hard to hijack bit torrents

575
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,160
You know at a bite or a frame level or whatever the heck it is

576
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,000
So you may be think you're downloading an MP3, but it could be a virus or some

577
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,120
Spyware or some other program which inevitably is going to happen because that's just a nature of people

578
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,480
So I'm thinking about kind of that social change and how can we get more people? How can we incentivize people to subscribe and

579
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,480
Because basically you're hurting the you know the podcaster when

580
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,000
When you're trying to get this in real time and

581
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,800
This isn't an issue if you have 10 people maybe subscribe to your podcast, but the minute you

582
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,400
The minute you gain traction and more people start to listen you start to get penalized and that is bad

583
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,760
So we definitely want to change that behavior so getting more people subscribed

584
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,440
Making it easier for them to subscribe and creating an infrastructure of low quality bandwidth

585
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,200
I mean, I'm even now looking at releasing the source code at a different time of day just because ban with the night is is

586
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,880
While there's less being used therefore I could put that in a different infrastructure

587
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
So lots and lots of stuff to think about and I just wanted to mention that here briefly

588
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,640
So that smart people who listen to the show could think with me, maybe we'll come up with some cool solutions

589
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Most of our high spots were coming to us now by TV serious central not this one serious 148 Adam Curry's

590
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,080
Odd show experience the unexpected tell the world

591
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Tell us to everybody for whatever they are

592
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,160
serious central 148. I was just looking through

593
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,760
Let me see if there's anything else we want to talk about that came through on email

594
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Now, I think we're just gonna leave it like that

595
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Keep the feedback coming

596
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,280
If you could go a little light on the attachments for the next couple of days

597
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,040
As my trash starts to empty out on Gmail and hopefully the size of the inbox will start to increase a bit

598
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
You can always put and you know, just post a link that always is very helpful and

599
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,440
Much appreciated if you have a promo

600
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,040
I send it off to

601
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,920
Submit at podshow.com if you got a mashup send it to mashup at podshow.com

602
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,160
And if it's pod safe music submitted over at the pod safe music network or send it to podsafe at podshow.com

603
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,000
And that'll be it for today's source code

604
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
30 minutes on the nose

605
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,320
Perfect so now my call can come in I can call Chris back up load this sucker

606
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,680
And tomorrow we'll have another full blown daily source code will have some more promo's pod safe music

607
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,680
I think I'm gonna have to play clone box again though because man I'm really loving that song

608
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,640
So I can't stress enough, but I'd really like you to subscribe to this show

609
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
I know that you're impatient you sit there clicking on

610
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,480
Non-existent URLs trying to guess what the file name will be for today's shows

611
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
So you can get it as soon as it's released

612
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,640
But I really would like you to subscribe

613
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
You can go to dailysourcecode.com

614
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,120
That's where you'll find the subscription URL or head on over to iindepotter.org

615
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
