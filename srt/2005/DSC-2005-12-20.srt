1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
With $16 million worth of airplanes strapped to my ass, then the next generation

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
radio content in my ears.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They are a Charlie 3-0-2, happy Tuesday everybody.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But I'm Brooklyn in the USA.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They're coming to the ground.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I take my name, got on a plane.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I find a place to go home.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm my train in the Westway.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm never in the plane, never be.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Look at my mama, my name is a racer.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm a farm car, not lingers, I'm a temperful racer.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm a man.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've got my kids with a set of chicks.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can't want to, until I take it in, I'm never in the trace.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I find a blue one, what I know about it was red.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I got red in the Westway.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm never in the plane, never be.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Look at my mama, my name is a racer.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm the farm car, not lingers, I'm a temperful racer.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm a man.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I get my kids with a set of chicks.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't want to, until I take it in, I'm never in the trace.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
As I don't do it, nobody will break.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I got red in the Westway.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm never in the plane, never be.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look at my mama, my name is a racer.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The genders, my name is Horatio for this Tuesday edition of the Daily Source Code, everybody.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How you doing?

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's Adam coming to you from the Cottage Curry Cottage and Guilford, the UK.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I got lots of feedback on yesterday's show.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Primarily about the shitty sound quality.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So thank you very much.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Peter was very concerned.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I listened back to him and he was like, oh man, he's so right.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm completely reconfiguring the studio here.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've tossed out that Yamaha digital workstation.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm back to the Soundcraft 4 channel.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It has a lot of advantages over the digital workstation.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm really digging it.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Although it's kind of cruddy and uses all kinds of semi-professional connectors.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So you get all kinds of buzz and hum all over the place.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, it seems to be working.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The one thing I changed really is the microphone processing.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I know a lot of you don't like the reverb.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I love it.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I love having a little bit of reverb there.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it's just ever so slight.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've put it into the board as what we call an insert.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I'm going to pull it out and then you know.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So this is without the sound processing on the microphone.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So let me know which one you like better.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you like it like this or do you like it like this?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I like it like this because it sounds a little bit crisp.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know for some reason it feels a bit better.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey, how you doing?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Working towards Christmas.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Tomorrow we're off to see my mom.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which means I'll have to have the next door neighbor.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Receive the package of the present that I bought for Patricia.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now, if you've been reading my weblog, you probably already know what it is.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But I'm not going to say anything because these days,

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
whether they're on super station downstairs in the kitchen,

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
she might actually be listening to the show.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It really could happen.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I got some shitty news though about my mom.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It really sucks.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So we're going to see her tomorrow.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So we've gotten touched to talk about schedule

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
because we're flying over in the Cessna 182.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And now she needs another biopsy.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh man, it's poor woman to fucking sucks.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This whole cancer business fucking blows.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Jesus Christ.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What a bitch.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So anyway, and it was a year ago that she was diagnosed for the first time

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and between Christmas and New Year's is when she had a lung removed.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So it's just been, it's been one that's not been a very good year.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And she's obviously not feeling very up and positive about stuff.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So we're going to go and send her some Christmas cheer.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And we're going to go hand-deliver it, God damn it.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anyway, for today, a couple of threads we got going on here

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that I want to keep in touch with.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The Metro Sexual Moment, as we continue to talk about

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
what best shaving implement to use.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yet another testimonial for this Gillette Mark III Power Razor

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
as Giles says he converted to it earlier this year.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can't recommend that enough and his wife agrees.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And here, I didn't quite understand this bit, but I wanted to read it to you.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And on holiday or a weekend away, I take the razor with me.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I lather up, wait a minute, press the power button and shave.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then leaving it powered up, turn the razor over,

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
take off the blade, apply the back of it to my wife's button

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and wait a minute or two for her to lather up.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, as I read it all of a sudden, I got it.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Giles, man, you're twisted puppy.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But good to know, if you know what I'm saying.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I keep the egg nog feedback coming.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I must have received 30 different egg nog recipes.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I am totally going to going to try and make some this year.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Interestingly enough, Paul Parkinson says,

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
your plane of cries about egg nog, it forced me into action.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can absolutely buy egg nog in the United Kingdom.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is the whole point, you see, is haven't seen it anywhere on shelves.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He says he's always known it by its Dutch name, Advocat.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I'm familiar with that, but Advocat.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's not the same thing as egg nog.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's way different.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Advocat is much thicker.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can eat it with a spoon.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Anyway, Paul did a little bit of calling on my behalf,

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and although Sainsbury's don't have any,

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
waitrose in godoming does.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is great.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I got personal shoppers for listeners.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I love it. Thank you.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
More egg nog feedback here.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hey Adam, this is Matt from the Switch podcast.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just finished listening to the daily source code number 301.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I heard your comment on egg nog and how you have a hard time finding it in the UK.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am a Canadian that is now living in Taipei, Taiwan, and I feel your pain when it comes to the egg nog.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think that an egg nog recipe segment would make a great holiday addition to the source code,

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
or at least a great addition to the show notes.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm going to release a Christmas episode on Sunday featuring only Christmas music from podsafe artists,

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and it would be great to have some rum and egg nog in my hand at the same time.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For more of all the podcasts, check out www.theswitched.com.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thanks.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yo. Nice ending there.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay, thanks, Matt.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And for those of you who have been writing in saying,

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
where the hell is the Christmas podshow podcast?

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is the thing that I set up at xmus.podshow.com.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So I had a completely tricked out.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I had a folder.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I dropped a song.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I actually had dropped two songs in or a block of songs, which I did have to pre-mix.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It would automatically take it off and post it to the wordpress blog, et cetera.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You know, FTP, the files, the whole thing perfectly set.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then I started getting all these messages about people saying,

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
you know, what the fuck?

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Where's the xmus.podshow podcast?

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And it turns out that what we had a security breach, I guess.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It was essentially there was a file with some information sitting on a server somewhere.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And a couple of nice people pointed out to us.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So we, of course, had to go and lock stuff down and change all kinds of passwords.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And so, of course, my password was changed.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But this wonderful little script I wrote was just failing and not telling me about it.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Because, well, I'm not a great developer and Apple script.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, you know, I can only do so much.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So I got to change that and then I'll get back to posting it.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I do have a backlog of stuff.

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I'm thinking I'll just release a whole bunch at the same time,

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
just to get everyone up to speed so I apologize for that.

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And hopefully, it's 12 past 12 here in the afternoon.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hopefully, I'll still have some time before the wing commander shows up.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because the wing commander's coming over with the Charlie 182 today.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And he's going to stay overnight with us and that, oh, you know what?

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, man.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll have to interview him.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, this is what I've been waiting for.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Did we want to do that last time when flying was when we couldn't fly

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
because of the inclement weather?

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think I was planning on it then.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It'll be perfect.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So we'll either do it tonight or maybe I'll maybe I'll do it when we fly to Rotterdam tomorrow.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So the deal is, you know, because I still want to safety pilot the fly long.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So William's going to fly with me.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And of course, the machine is still in the Antwerp.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And won't be here at Farrow until you want to tell it's gone through its complete program,

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
whatever.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Excuse me, sir.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
William's going to take the engine out.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Put a black edition engine in whatever the hell that is.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's going to get all these cool upgrades and tune-ups and new GPS system.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And I'm really excited.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So anyway, then tomorrow I'll have another safety pilot Roy.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He'll fly back with us and he'll stay overnight here.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then he'll take the plane back the next day.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So it's kind of a long stretch.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But the convenience is still really, really is nice.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is really worth it.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh yeah, you know, if you have a promo for your show.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And you know, want it played on the daily source code.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Of course, it's not a guarantee.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But just go over to promos.podshow.com and drop your promo.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And I've been hunting around.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think I've played most of the, at least the ones that I like.

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You know, if you buy the way four minute promos, you usually don't fly.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Even a minute 35 is pretty damn long.

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But sometimes they'll work.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Will you marry me?

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How can four little words cause such stress?

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, if you've heard those words lately, you know what I mean.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000

Hi, Adam.

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's David Straum, former editor in chief of tomshardware.com.

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm out on the street looking for a job this holiday season.

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And I wanted to talk to you about ways that I could help improve podshow.com's website

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
with my editorial skills.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I know you're a busy guy and you got a lot going on,

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but I think I could really add some value and help you do some great things with podshow.

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you believe anything is possible?

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We do.

We revolve around you.

246
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is Jay Donley from madpod.com.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is how I envision Adam Curry,

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
making love to his sincere machine.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Uh, commercial.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I remember your time.

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh, man.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Nice cup of sincere.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
First, you put in your sugar.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I use the medium roast pods, by the way.

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And also what's nice about it is you kind of give you something to do while the machine's warming up.

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know, you hit that center button to get it rolling.

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't take a lot of sugar, just a small spoonful.

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I remember.

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Since they owe machine, and then you get a nice frothy rich.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then you pour some semi-skinned milk in.

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And then coffee with a nice flavor goes down smooth.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not too bitter.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You get your cup.

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You get your sugar.

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You get your milk.

266
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And by the time you're done with that, it's ready to the buttons ready to be hit.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's him.

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hit the button, baby.

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I do love it, man.

270
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'd be so good for that company.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I have been good to that company, damn it.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thanks to the guys over at Mad Pod.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I hear my eye chats still open.

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
People coming and going and making wishing sounds.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I listened to, there was a Mad Pod podcast.

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I'm a little confused if it was Mike,

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I think it was Mike.

278
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Last Friday in San Francisco, we did what is known in the, I guess,

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the PR marketing business as an analyst meeting.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And what that means is that we met with a whole bunch of analysts,

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and analysts are people who research information,

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
usually to resell it, like the gardener group or forester.

283
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's a kind of company you got to think about.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But there was also Nielsen was there because, of course,

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
they, that's what they're in the business of doing is research and talk.

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And of course, they're mainly in statistics, statistics that

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
translate directly into sales for broadcast medium.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And also, let me see, don't they have some kind of metric metrics

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
or measurement system for the web as well?

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think so.

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If not, they should.

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
They're part of the VINU, actually, which is a Dutch company.

293
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And we talked about podcasting and about our vision,

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and pod shows vision for podcasting.

295
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And what we're going to do, and we actually went quite far,

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
it was, if you will, it was kind of a strategy cast for analyst,

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
was usually includes a flower point, nice power point.

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We kind of liked the spice it up a bit with some audio and video stuff as well.

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And Mike, I think he was one of the guys there,

300
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and I'm not sure if he's a part of the mad podcast,

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
or actually I put a link to this podcast on my,

302
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
on my curry.com weblog yesterday.

303
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You should definitely listen to it if you're interested in knowing

304
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
what your pod shows up to, and what we're going to be doing in the next couple of months,

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and where we're headed.

306
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I'm not just saying that because the guy was really excited about it,

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
was extremely positive, but I was completely unsolicited.

308
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And I actually thought that he, I mean, we didn't have anyone sign any non-disclosure agreement,

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
or tell him not to say anything, but he was, he was actually quite secretive about all of it.

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I was like, wow, you know, that's okay.

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, I don't think the art secret that we're out after 100 million listeners

312
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
is that big of a secret anymore, because that's really where pod show is headed.

313
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you're listening to this now on serious satellite radio,

314
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you're probably thinking, what the hell is all this about?

315
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Well, this is pod casting.

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's the extension to your satellite radio,

317
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and you're going to be hearing lots of different shows,

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and there's a lot more of us and a lot more out there.

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And you can find it, you can go to podshow.com,

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
find all kinds of cool recommendations.

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can go all the kinds of places on the internet.

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Even Google, just type in the type of pod cast that you're looking for.

323
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Google usually shows up with some pretty good results I found,

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
since the universe of pod casts is still fairly limited compared to that at web logs.

325
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Just saying whatever you want.

326
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Does even, yes, there is actually a knitting pod cast.

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I saw someone, I think, post on one of the email groups the other day.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I was like, okay.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Now, you know, we've really got it made.

330
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let me see.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What's it going to talk about?

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was going to talk about some performing right stuff.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, that's really more for podcasters who are listening.

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So I'll save that for the second half of the hours.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Anyway, as I said, stars 103 on serious.

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We're just one channel away from Howard Stern.

337
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sure that you're waiting for him and anticipating him.

338
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And bumping is in pretty awesome shit here on 103.

339
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
After this show, we have Pacific Coast,

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
the hell way followed by Mad Weinstein, Dawn and Drew.

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I keep forgetting to look at the schedule.

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The lineup PW is going to kill me.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Anyway, we're on four hours.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I think we're still on the mornings as well.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They repeated.

346
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'd love to do to double the amount of hours.

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You know, I've suggested this to serious before.

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
As I've suggested to them streaming.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, come extra blogger.

350
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I hear you.

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've suggested they stream these channels.

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But I think they're really busy with Howard Mania right now.

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So I'll kind of take in a little somewhat of a backseat, I guess.

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But I'll let you know.

355
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We'll keep in touch on that.

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You know what?

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I was looking through the pod save music network.

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And man, first of all, thank you for all the suggestions that you've been sending in.

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Some of the stuff was really cool.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And I am saving it up.

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And I am marking on my playlist to play.

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But today, I really felt like doing like a golden oldie almost.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Although it's not a golden oldie.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's just damn good music from a dream to thorn.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm man, I'm blue, that'll sky.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Rolls is daisy.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Spinning inside my mind.

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And as I float through the mist.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Or all below me seems so far behind.

370
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like again.

371
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Fly, fly, fly.

372
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Nothing seems to matter.

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll let you hear beside me.

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Fly, fly, fly.

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
When you're with you, I'll feel like you.

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And all the cause wouldn't lie.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And motion seems like you could be paralyzed.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And the light inside me feels so bright.

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's hope we'll need it tonight.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Like I can fly, fly, fly, nothing seems to lie.

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But today, I really felt like doing like a golden oldie.

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Fly, fly, fly, fly.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
When you're with you, I'll feel like you.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Fly, fly, fly, nothing seems to matter.

385
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll let you hear beside me.

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Fly, fly, fly, fly.

387
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
When you're with you, I'll feel like you.

388
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And all the cause wouldn't lie.

389
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And motion seems like you could be paralyzed.

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And the light inside me feels so bright.

391
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But today, I really felt like doing like a golden oldie.

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Fly, fly, fly, fly, nothing seems to lie.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But today, I really feel like you.

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly.

395
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
When you're with you, I'll feel like you.

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly.

397
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And there feels so bad

398
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Life, life, life, nothing seems better

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You're here beside me

400
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Life, life, life, now you're when

401
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm here with you, I feel like

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Life, life, life, life, nothing seems better

403
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You're here beside me

404
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Life, life, life, everything

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Life, life, life, life, nothing seems better

406
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You're here beside me

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Life, life, life, life, when you're feeling

464
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,560
I wanted to follow up on some of your thoughts about fees for podcasts which you raised in a recent

465
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,360
DSC when you were talking about blank tapes and CDs. Now in this particular instance it looks like

466
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,960
that idea might not fly but it got me thinking. Sometime ago I was attempting to get an MP3 player

467
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,440
that I could listen to while forcing myself up and down my local swimming pool. Yes that's pretty

468
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,680
sad I know but you know I enjoy the DSC so much I'd like to listen to it while I'm swimming.

469
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,480
But due to the fact that it's almost impossible to rely on reliably here anything whilst doing that

470
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,280
I just gave up. Anyway the point is I was swimming yesterday and thinking about your comments

471
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,720
about podcasts receiving royalties for their content saved to some sort of media. As I went up and

472
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,040
down the pool it occurred to me that public venues such as bars, lifts and yes even swimming pools

473
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,760
have to pay annual fees to the performing rights at society in the UK and I presume similarly

474
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,800
in other territories with equivalent organizations when they play copyrighted music in their venues.

475
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,120
This got me thinking why couldn't you have a business model where Portugal makes

476
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,280
canned genre specific streaming potsafe music available via broadband now to any public buildings

477
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,680
that which actually wanted. The deal is they no longer have to pay the fees to the performing

478
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,320
rights at society or country equivalent but they do pay a modest annual fee to pot show which

479
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,720
then distributes the proceeds to musicians on the potsafe music network. Now using the PRS as an example

480
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,640
if you had just one CD player in a nightclub in the UK and it doesn't occupy an area exceeding 120

481
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,520
square meters yes it sounds strange but that's it then it costs you almost £200 a year to do that

482
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,040
that would be about $350. Now as you'd imagine nightclubs tend to have more than one CD player

483
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,240
they have quite a lot of musical equipment and they have to pay fees to the performing rights

484
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,360
society for all of that stuff. Now you can actually find out some of the fees by the way if people

485
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,400
interested at the PRS website at www.prs.co.uk. But here's what I'm thinking. What if there was a

486
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,640
potential public venues commercial use license with a flat fee on a pervenue basis? I think that

487
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,120
people would go for it I think people and businesses would think find that a worthwhile alternative

488
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,120
one because it's simple two because it's going to be cheaper. Now to avoid creating a top heavy

489
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,920
administrative structure you'd want to run it on an honor system but on the whole most people

490
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,640
or businesses if they know the deal will honor their obligations particularly if it's a saving

491
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:08,440
over the fees they have to pay to the likes of the PRS or the RIA or whatever a equivalent organization

492
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,680
we're talking about anywhere in the world. Now that might be considered trading on the toes of

493
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:19,000
the established order but hey we're talking disruptive technology here and no one said that these

494
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,160
people could have them monopoly on music forever. I think that this could be a very popular I think

495
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,840
it may be a great opportunity to also promote pot-safe music and tunes that otherwise

496
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,600
wouldn't get an easy public hearing through established channels. So I'd be very interested

497
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:45,720
know what you think about that and what other listeners to the DMC think. Okay Ralph. Well I don't know

498
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,160
I have a whole bunch of thoughts on that topic and by the way the reason that I'm just bringing

499
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,520
all this stuff up is because if the rules are changing for the broadcasting industry I think the

500
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,440
rules will change in many other places including all I guess that is also performance right

501
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,480
when you talk about clubs. I didn't know that that's how to work that's how they charge it by

502
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,960
based on the number of CD players that's pretty interesting CD players and space I think it's

503
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:20,920
different for offices and other you know corporations I do it by head count see the thing here is that

504
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:29,800
I don't know if I'm necessarily for creating a parallel system that is exactly the same. I think that

505
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm not quite sure how but it feels to me like the concept of a performance right fee in general is

506
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,680
I think that that just might have to change. It's already changed in podcasting and you see

507
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:56,600
what incredible benefit it is to to the pod safe music artists and I think that the reason why

508
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,840
the RIA and all the mainstream music industry you know they really had you know they had the

509
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,400
monopolistic power to go after all these markets but I don't know if it's necessarily good to

510
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,640
recreate exactly that I think that there's many ways that artists can make lots of money

511
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,640
particularly because they don't need to sign up to the traditional system of a record company so

512
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,080
their profit margins will be much much much higher. I'm talking 95% higher

513
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:34,920
or really of every dollar they'll be getting 90% of the revenue

514
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,240
and what really is the cost of the cost of getting something shipped out you know

515
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:50,360
so I've got to think about that. I certainly wouldn't want pod show to be that organization

516
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:57,160
would have to be some kind of independent organization but oh man another crazy organization to be a

517
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,560
member of I don't know I don't know I kind of like it really really simple and so far it seems to be

518
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,600
working okay and I think that getting your music played in clubs is fantastic you know as long

519
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,360
as people have a way to find out what it is and people usually do you know so maybe we need pod

520
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,840
safe music clubs where you know who subscribe to a feed that brings them all the latest maybe

521
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,320
dished out by genre and in return they have flyers in the club or something like that or you

522
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,800
couldn't go online and see what was played at the club you know something like that that would be

523
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,480
cool that's the kind of stuff that I'm looking for honestly hi Adam the finished parliament is

524
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:42,120
planning to rush through a very scary law by April 2006 writes John Vermont if somebody is found

525
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:48,120
guilty of copyright infringement in Finland that person can be made to publish and pay for an ad

526
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:55,000
on a local or national newspaper in which he or she admits his or her fault the craziest thing

527
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,680
is that the winning side is allowed to create the ad. Needless to say this law has already scared

528
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,160
everyone as it is seen as a way for the record industry watchdogs to humiliate people this law

529
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,480
is part of the finished parliament's efforts to rapidly ratify the European Union so called

530
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,400
enforcement directive scary name huh and he put in some original links to the stories um

531
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,320
I'll make sure those get out into the show notes god this is not some man you don't even own your own

532
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:37,240
shit anymore and then if you borrow something or make a mistake or just share something you get humiliated

533
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,520
publicly come on let's hang people much much better we used to do it it was only a couple hundred

534
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,520
years ago we could do that again hang the fuckers duty from host says hi Adam or browsing

535
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,040
the net i found this info about the Belgian music rights being from Belgium this interest me

536
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,680
a Belgian member of parliament Bart Tomolane has made some comments about the monopoly of saybam

537
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,280
that's the Belgian ask have be am I he says it's a bureaucratic system that sits on a huge pile of

538
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:11,000
money he's calling for all organizers of parties or DJs to refuse the invoice sabam sends them

539
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Bart goes on they asked fixed prices without any explanation about the bills nor where this money is

540
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:25,160
going to and they are only allowed to collect money for the artist they represent some random test

541
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:31,640
show that 15% of the used music on at parties cannot be found in the sabam catalog DJ should

542
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,680
not have to pay for this sabam reply that prices are about the same as our neighbor countries

543
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,320
it's impossible to control the 15% bloody bloody bloody bloody bloody bloody bloody bloody bloody

544
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:47,800
bloody bloody bloody bloody interesting so there's a lot of stuff happening and it's it's different

545
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,200
at at every single level even though all these countries are within the European Union they're

546
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,280
all doing something different so we're just continue to keep our eye on it and just discussing

547
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,480
amongst ourselves some good comments going on in the show notes which you can find at

548
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,400
shownotes.info or just from the link underneath each podcast at dailysourcecode.com

549
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:16,760
yesterday I played the first Trinity sound imaging done by Jeff Smith and he was so nice to

550
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,840
make those remixes for me so I'm not going to do a Trinity segment today I'm going to try and cut it

551
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,200
down to one or two a week so I can collect some good stuff and have an ongoing thread about it but

552
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,160
Jeff also does other music has quite a selection up on the pod safe music network and

553
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,240
he sent me a link to his pod safe christmas song so I figured I'd give him a play my own

554
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,200
merry christmas Jeffrey sees Smith the snow is falling down tonight

555
