1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charley 2-2-6

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A voice 65 million years in the making.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm at a mysterious.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm like a horse.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Rated R.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
117 not admitted without current.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, we prepared to move on to the ceremony.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Nothing could ever prepare you for what awaits you.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
At the ceremony.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's fantastic.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's incredible.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And it is Tuesday, August, August 23rd, 2005.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I really did have, well, not quite 16 million dollars worth,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
but I didn't have an airplane strap to my ass today.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's why the source code is so late.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's 10.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Actually, it's 10.05 pm.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Coming to you from the Curry Cottage,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and the affluence suburb of Surrey.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's Gilford.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is your daily source code.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, I don't know if you can tell,

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but I've got the whole new equipment set up connected properly now.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I mean, I can even do my nails with this stuff.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's so freaking automatic.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I guess I'll have to geek out a little bit

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and tell you a bit about the setup.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
By now, you know that the,

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
was it, I was talking to Steve Leaves over at Surrey.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's, he, he didn't call the podcast table.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He called it the, the podcast complex.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's the complex.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The podcast complex that my father-in-law built for me.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's downstairs.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And Thursday.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The movie.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've actually had to hire two movers to come and help me

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
bring this huge thing up into the, into the office.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So tomorrow afternoon will be clearing everything out day,

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
clearing all the decks,

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
moving carpeting out,

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
moving the current desk that I'm using over,

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you know, towards the wall.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then I have to move the bookcase away from the wall.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So the door can open all the way.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Otherwise this thing won't fit in.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Then we get it in on Thursday.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And then I have to basically just drop everything on top

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
because the wiring is all done.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Uh, pod save music coming up.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Plenty of promo's for you.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And, uh, some audio feedback.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now what do I do?

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Like, good 30, 40 minutes show.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Kick it off with a mashup that you're just going to,

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it'll bring tears to your eyes.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A shout out for the magic rocket man,

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
aggro one on the source code.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Like you know me.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You look right through me.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm rockin' blind.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ready, go rock.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Go home, girl.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's said that this is mine.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You'll help to let me and let's get out of our wall.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But try to understand.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Try to understand.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Try to try to understand.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They won't make any dick.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, her what brought me the meritor...

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We would try to witness till my singing when I'm jogar.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Play them side or the board again.

78
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,860
Where have you known it, maize but Why don't you ever let this spell life

79
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,560
all over, or somewhere else.

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,500
I sure learned that, I've tried realize their own song,

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm just one-horse naive and growing up in a hole range

82
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
and cut me in.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They are an ordinary destiny.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Listen to how, oh, girl, mama, cry in the phone

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
To sum those my baby and my girl to be at home

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But try to understand, try to understand

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Try to understand, try to understand

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's a magic

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Everybody with me is out of pace

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't zoom and run

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come on, come on

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't withstand you

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Come on, come on

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on, Kanami, say the smile

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I can't less than available

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I won't you woman from a child

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But try to understand, try to understand

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Try to understand

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:55,440
oh, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ahhhh...

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:25,440
I'll come play and you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I know, know, know, no-one. I'll be right here. You, you-you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, your, I'm a rocker-feat. These are the things I'll found. Come on, come on. darling, I wanna come on, that I'll rock you,

104
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Baby, you're not very rich of it, baby

105
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I still want to find you

106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I'll be in the jungle today

107
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I hope we'll be in the jungle today

108
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Baby, you're not very rich of it, baby

109
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,440
I still want to find you, baby

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I'll be in the jungle today

111
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
I hope we'll be in the jungle today

112
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Baby, you're not very rich of it, baby

113
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I still want to find you

114
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Come on, girl, let's stay with us

115
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Come on, girl, let's let's get out of here

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Come on, come on, let's stay in

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Come on, let's stay in

118
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Come on, come on, come on, let's try our best

119
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Please imagine me

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Yes, yes, yes

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I would pay money

122
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I would absolutely pay money to receive mashups

123
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Like that

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I'd grow one, got it off a mashup town dot com

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Awesome

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I was just, you know, I was thinking

127
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
We could probably make a, well first of all

128
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
We could misuse serious satellite radio

129
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
And we should do like a mashup top 10

130
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Or something like that

131
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Just to get this stuff out there and a legal way

132
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
But you know, you have all these different music services now

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
And there's basically two types of music services

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
You have iTunes where you buy a song

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
It's DRM

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
And if you lose the song then it's gone

137
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Right, so you basically have to track your own data

138
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Unlike other services like audible

139
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Actually

140
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
I like what they do

141
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
You also download an audio book

142
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
And it's, it's DRM

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
So you can't copy it or send it to anybody else

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,440
And you can, I think you can, as with iTunes

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
You can use it on up to five different devices

146
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Not too sure about audible

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
But if you lose it, you can always just go back to the library

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
And download a fresh copy

149
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
That's what I like about audible

150
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I think iTunes would do that

151
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
So that's one model

152
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
The other model like Rhapsody

153
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Or the Yahoo Music Service

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Is you pay a monthly fee

155
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
And then you have access to the entire catalog

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Which can be up to

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
I think what is it now?

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
A million, two million songs, something like that

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
And then you can basically use as much as you like

160
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
But I think it'll only work on one device

161
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
And if you stop paying

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Then everything that you downloaded

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Self-destructs

164
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
So that's a whole different model

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
But it's also working very well

166
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
So why couldn't we, you know, basically

167
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Turn a couple of mixers loose

168
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,440
And maybe we could have a mashup channel

169
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Which you could subscribe to

170
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,440
And it would be, it'd have to be at a pretty low cost

171
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Maybe it just, it should just be a part of Rhapsody

172
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Maybe that's where, I mean, it could be done totally legal there

173
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,440
And I guess somehow we could figure out how

174
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
It would be micro payments

175
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Because, you know, how many songs

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Were in that mashup, right?

177
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
And then there's still going to be something

178
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Left over for the producer

179
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
I hope

180
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
And then we could actually, you know, turn some of this into

181
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
At least a beer money for the guy

182
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
So we're doing these mashups

183
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Because it's outstanding

184
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I would definitely look into that

185
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I promise you

186
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
So I got the new, I got the new set

187
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
This is the same gear that I used

188
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
On yesterday's show

189
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Only I'm not in the garage

190
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Right now I'm up in the studio

191
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
And what the only difference

192
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Actually, this Yamaha workstation is so cool

193
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Because you can program it to record

194
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
On to its internal hard drive

195
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Right now I have it set up

196
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Pretty much the way my old mixer set up

197
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Was only, it has all these great effects

198
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
And EQ settings and processing

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
All built in

200
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
And I've really relearned a lot about audio

201
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
That I just forgotten

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Because, you know, the unlike like pro tools

203
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Whether it's a lot of, you know, click and drag

204
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
And graph work

205
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
And I find that it's so easy

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
That, you know, actually you wind up

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Just kind of guessing how to do stuff

208
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
And the interface on this digital workstation

209
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
It's like a, you know, a black on yellow

210
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
And display

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Kind of like a, one of those, uh,

212
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
It was a T-R-S-100s

213
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
You know, remember those with the built in

214
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
300-bought modem

215
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
So that's kind of the size of the display

216
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
It has some rudimentary bit graphics

217
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Really, uh, pixel graphics I guess

218
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
What do you call them?

219
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Just, you know, little like drawings

220
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Of markers and stuff

221
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
It's really low-fi

222
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Um, but therefore, when you go into editing

223
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Effect or EQ setting

224
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
You know, it really has the basics

225
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
And it's very, you know, you really

226
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Get into it because you have to pay attention

227
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
To this interface

228
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
It's so crude compared to what you can do on a computer

229
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
That I really learned a lot more about the way

230
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Forms and about attack and decay

231
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
And, you know, all kinds of

232
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Just all kinds of

233
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Do you hear that by the way?

234
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
That's my other Mac is freaking out

235
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
It's, uh, it's overheating

236
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Um, so now I've routed through

237
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Something, and I'll stop with a geek talk

238
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
About the audio on a second

239
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
I've routed through the internal bus

240
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
I've routed everything

241
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Out through the, uh, valve compressor

242
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
And, uh, man, it sounds like I'm one of those pirate ships

243
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
On, uh, on AM, you know, the sound

244
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
There's nice and pumping

245
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
My balls aren't really as big as they sound

246
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Let's put it that way, okay?

247
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,440
On this big episode of the Delta Park project

248
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Some hot penguin on penguin action

249
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Jason Anna and Ichiro out in right field

250
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Name this band

251
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Plus, it's magic

252
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
We predict who's going to win the next season of Survivor

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Go to our website at DeltaParkProject.com

254
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Hard show

255
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Content that will make you walk the dog

256
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
And kiss your mother

257
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Well, you know, they spend hours on the script

258
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Written at the last minute

259
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
It recorded on modern British equipment

260
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Recorded on the cheap

261
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
What's the result?

262
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
The publicly left

263
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
And downloaded by mistake

264
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Sorry, Kiwi Hanka

265
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Lovely tautar

266
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Gary Dring

267
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Sounds like a girl

268
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Clever little pod

269
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Two people, chat

270
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
So, um, this morning

271
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
My whole day kind of changed

272
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Literally due to road and weather conditions

273
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
This morning

274
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Got up bright and early

275
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,440
The wing commander was bringing the 1802RG over

276
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
To take my in-laws back to Rotterdam

277
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
It was a beautiful sunny morning

278
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Here in Gilford and at Farrow

279
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
At my local airfield

280
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
And, um, so, you know, we took off

281
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
We were kind of on the heavy side

282
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I have to say it was an interesting take off

283
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Long use of runway

284
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
You know, because I knew my in-laws

285
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Did buy stuff while they were here

286
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
And it was a lot of baggage

287
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
So, we didn't fill up the tanks all the way

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Um, and literally went over the English channel

289
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,440
And then just as we hit the, um, the Dutch side

290
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Right near Zeeland

291
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Zeeland

292
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Boom, full clouds

293
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,440
We had to go, uh, instrument, uh, flying IFR

294
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Um, which is cool

295
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Because that, uh, turned into a, a training lesson for me

296
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Because that's my next step is to get my instrument rating

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Um, so, in the, in the clouds

298
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
You're seeing absolutely nothing

299
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
And you're just listening to, uh, air traffic control

300
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Giving you vector

301
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
So, you know, now turn right to, you know, to this heading

302
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Um, and then go down to 2000 feet

303
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
And, you know, you just follow that

304
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
And, you know, there was a sudden this little dial that pops up

305
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
And that's your glide path

306
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,440
And if you keep it right on right in the right center there

307
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Um, eventually you break through the clouds

308
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Which today were at 300 feet

309
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
And boom, you know, there's the airfield

310
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
There's the landing strip right in front of you

311
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
And then you just kind of put her down, right?

312
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
And it's fascinating experience

313
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
So, we dropped them off

314
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Then, um, we'll even, I went to do a couple of touching goes

315
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
And some training at, uh, Midasay Lont

316
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Which is kind of back in the same direction

317
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Um, did some touching goes

318
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Good crosswind, you know, like 25, 30 knots

319
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
So, it got some experience with that

320
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
It's a little harder to land an airplane

321
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
When the wind is coming from the side

322
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Um, you know, gasped it up

323
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Had a quick little lunch and then got the weather report

324
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
And it's going to be shit here tomorrow

325
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
And there's no instrument landing system

326
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
So, um, we wouldn't be able to come back in tomorrow morning

327
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
And maybe not at all tomorrow if it really stays bad

328
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Uh, so we made the decision to come back today

329
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Um, so that did put some extra flying time in that

330
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
I hadn't expected and, uh, also dented my wallet for a hundred bucks

331
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
For the hotel and Antwerp, which I couldn't cancel

332
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Uh, but okay, so we flew back

333
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
And, um, you know, and I said, well, I got, uh, got some time here

334
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
So, that's when I reconnected all the gear

335
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
And actually, um, just got off the phone with the San Francisco office

336
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Things are rocking out there, I can't wait to get back

337
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Um, CC Chapman and, uh, Chris Rockwell

338
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Um, of the daily download, uh, of the poop caster

339
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Uh, he's out there

340
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Um, and uh, they're hanging and they're, uh, talking all kinds of stuff

341
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,440
With about pod safe music network and the integration with pod show

342
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
And gosh, it's just, it's good things coming on

343
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Including, um, um, uh, uh, pod caster delivery network

344
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
That's what we're going to call it

345
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Pod caster delivery network

346
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Hmm, that's a nice ring to it

347
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440

back and the war on terror and about the price of oil and well on behold he

350
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,600
might gmail some audio feedback well produced by the way cleverly disguised promo

351
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
hey Adam it's Chris from the financial aid podcast and financial aid podcast.com

352
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,800
with some audio feedback of an oil and gas prices from yesterday's show

353
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,160
if you're looking for more information about why oil and gas prices are so high your

354
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,760
first stop should be www.opensecrets.org there you'll find that to the top 10 campaign

355
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,560
finance contributors to the congressional committees on energy art oil and gas companies and

356
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,240
electric utilities if there's any wonder why the legislation about oil and gas

357
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
that was just passed in your energy bill is so slanted heavily in favor of oil and gas

358
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,720
companies the answer is in the campaign finance details daily source code listeners

359
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
you want to squeeze every drop of gas out of their energy dollar continued to yesterday's

360
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,120
in today's financial aid podcast for eight tips on how to save more money at the pump

361
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
thanks a lot Adam

362
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,120
people don't have the internet and the only way as podcasters and podcast listeners can

363
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,600
get this medium across the way that it's a win win situation is by making sure that

364
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,840
the the malls the bowling alleys the hotels the donut shops all the coffee shops

365
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,520
have access to Wi-Fi this is the way that a lot of us who have PDA sync up every day

366
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,800
this is the way that we can get the message across to the vendors out there they're missing

367
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:47,680
out on listeners and they should they should sponsor podcasters there's a lot of hard work

368
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,960
to be done and I still don't understand under you know 2005 why internet access is an available

369
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,680
over the whole world in a way that's cheap and affordable and this is a win win for everybody

370
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,560
why isn't that people don't get it this is the way you can make money but you can also

371
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:15,840
enjoy something and this is it's critical because I see a lot of people that are interested

372
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,920
but they have no real way of connecting so that's the message how do we connect the world

373
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,160
right on my brother mark kill so a lot of messages there mark really appreciate it

374
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,920
I want to say regarding yesterday's talk about Iraq and the war on terror and oil as you

375
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:46,000
heard in the financial aid podcast I got a lot of email about that and all of it was really

376
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,200
thoughtful and well put together not everyone agreed with what I was saying but no one

377
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,720
jumped out and flamed you know because I think I did hit some points for almost everybody

378
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,800
and there and some things lots people didn't agree with but I really appreciate all that

379
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,280
feedback and there's no way I can respond to it all personally but I've taken everything to

380
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,920
hard and everything into account and you know we'll we'll see if my opinion changes over time

381
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,600
and how things play out basically see how to couple of things in my list oh you know that

382
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,360
viox stuff that that the woman won the lawsuit 235 million dollars I think it was

383
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,280
my in-laws and we're actually prescribed that both of them for a while my mother-in-law took it for

384
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,080
like a week and I think my father-in-law who actually is he has a quadruple bypass and I think that

385
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,760
you know this this viox stuff gives you heart attacks you know so they were kind of

386
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:53,680
freaked out about that I don't think that one week of use can do too much damage I think this

387
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,680
is really prolonged use but that's still pretty scary man you know and stuff like marijuana is

388
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,280
outlawed and viox is out there you got to wonder do we have our priority set rise

389
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:30,480
listen to the reverse engineer's show the official podcast for the rock band the reverse

390
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,480
engineers

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,680
they've been featured on tech tv sky digital satellite radio in the UK and the David Lawrence show

392
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:22,400
it's all been discovered there's no need so much more can you hear what the buzz is all about

the multitudes went forth and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen

397
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,200
and casting their pods in this manner they were henceforth known as pod castors

moderator check www dot trendwatcher dot com for more details in this episode you can listen to

405
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,040
the interview recorded by Richard Lem at the R&D lab of British telecom and hip switch north

406
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,320
east of London. Hydrologist Ian Pearson and Ian Neut are talking about their new technology timeline

407
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,600
you know I have no idea what that's about but I thought it was really interesting for a couple

408
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,000
of reasons one it sounds like the the announcer is Dutch I'm pretty sure that's a Dutch accent

409
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,360
although it was referring to something in the United Kingdom and then I heard a pitch for

410
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,600
you know some professor guy who's available for weddings and bar mitzware as I was like that's

411
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,200
pretty interesting so I just thought I'd play that one for you before that you heard the promo

412
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,960
the band that's doing their own podcast was the reverse engineers the pod save music network

413
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,320
with this some cool stuff going on you know this is the place where podcasters can go to

414
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,400
get music that they is pod save they can play on their podcast and it's really like a discovery

415
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,040
system because you can see what other podcasters are playing and then we have these top 10 lists

416
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,040
of most listens because you can just go in and listen if you don't want to if you don't have a

417
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,720
podcasters you just want to listen to them tunes so you can see what's been listened to the most

418
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,440
which usually kind of follows along in relationship to the pod plays now I was talking to Chris

419
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,680
and and CC about this we're going to have to come up with an algorithm that refreshes that because

420
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,480
right now it's just you know the top plays of all time and it's going to be more dynamic so that

421
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,680
refreshes on a weekly basis and then we can have a real top 10 playlist which is exactly like the

422
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:38,800
big guys have you know so we're going to work on that what else I hope the store opens up one of

423
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,680
these days so you can actually sell through the pod save music network which is at pod save music

424
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,480
network.com and then we're also going to do the top 10 pod play once we have that worked out

425
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:58,240
with the top 10 pod plays on serious satellite radio and you know see if we can get some

426
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,040
get some broad distribution and some listenership for for these great bands because I mean

427
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,240
and that's just bands it's artists I mean it's all kinds of stuff going on over there

428
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,360
and every single day we're tweaking tweaking the site and be sure to you know send some feedback

429
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,920
there's a link on the site if you have any ideas because you know we're really you know just

430
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,160
trying to create something really nice here oh and by the way if you you know podcashes have to

431
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,400
report when they when they've played a song not all of you are doing that and I'm going to figure

432
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,320
out a way to incentivize you to do it but right now I'm just going to beg and plead if you

433
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,800
played something please report it so that we can keep track of that and so that we can you know

434
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,240
have better data for our top 10 list okay speaking of pod save music I this one actually came off

435
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:52,960
of the top 10 pod plays list pod save music network dot com music dot pod show dot com

436
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,360
I think I've played just about everything that's on the list except for this song and

437
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,960
you know at first I thought well it just sounds like kind of like an emo band you know and then I saw

438
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,840
let me see that from there from Stockholm Sweden I figured you know what the hell

439
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,720
stranger things that happened with those bands

440
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,140
like electronics

441
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I leave, it's all the chance of you say

442
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,840
But I was saying I was mad

443
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I was happy or sad

444
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

445
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
But the grass needs the green

446
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,840
And the sun needs the green

447
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
Like the gas leaves the blue

448
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,840
And the red leaves the green

449
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,840
So I'll see the sun

450
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,840
If the grass needs me

451
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

452
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

453
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:24,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

454
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

455
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

456
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

457
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

458
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:01,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

459
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,840
I'll hide, you think I need to suffer

460
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Okay, rock it man, it ain't

461
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
The bomb happys and hide from Stockholm, Sweden

462
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Pods safe on the daily source code

463
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,840
And that's it, just about 30 minutes is promised

464
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,840
The August 23rd edition of the source code

465
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,840
And I will be back tomorrow with another edition of the show

466
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,840
If you have iTunes

467
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,840
There's a new episode of the odd finder that's out

468
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Which should not be pretty good this week

469
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Dr. Dave did his magic on the show

470
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,840
And there's also the Spike Lee episode 4

471
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Which is supposed to be 4 or 4 but turns out to be 4 or 5

472
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Which you do not want to miss

473
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Because it's on the set human-numan shadow casting Spike Lee

474
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
And that's exclusively to Apple's iTunes

475
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Well worth it though, I think you'll enjoy that

476
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840

Okay, so I think that's

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Wait, don't hit fast forward yet

484
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,840
I wonder how many people do that at the end of the show

485
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,840
So damn man, there's nothing left to say

486
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I'm just going to skip to the next track

487
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I guess I'm just tired

488
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I'll try and do tomorrow's show a little bit more early

489
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Okay, take a note, I have such a backlog of promos

490
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
