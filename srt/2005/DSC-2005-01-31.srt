00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Daily source code, 1-31-25.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Transmators? We don't need no stinkin' transmitters!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Get ready for the generation of rockin' world!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Autastic! It's Adam Curry!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And it's Monday, the 31st of January 2005.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The power of the Lord!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The power of the Lord!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The power of the Lord!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You just witnessed a major league crash here.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hold on, what happened?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Shit, something fell off the wall, hold on.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The power of the Lord!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That'll show me.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, that was the...

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What was it?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's the cheap trick.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Platinum album that I was given.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Just fell off the wall here in the cottage.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You know, hey, everybody, how you doing?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Brand new week. Brand new source code.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A little bit late today.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's 5-20 in the afternoon coming to you from the Curry Cottage in Guilford.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Had a USA today photo shoot here today, which is why I'm late.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sorry.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, of course, with Patricia and I did yesterday's.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We spent all day cleaning up my...

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The final room really of the house, which is where we stored all the boxes.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And the home trainer by...

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You know, the sun, tan bed, and all that stuff.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And so we had to really clean up a lot of crap.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And stuff up to the attic.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And to just basically get the place looking livable.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And of course, I put up all my pictures, my albums, so that it would look nice, right?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then the cheap trick just fell off the wall.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If I can have to take a picture of it now, because this is one of those.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You get like a platinum record for sale of more than, I guess, a million units or whatever.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And has little platinum cassette next to it as well, because of course we didn't have CDs back then.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or we did, but they weren't really used very widely.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And that cassette has now, because of the fall, has kind of like shifted inside the encasing.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Hey, everybody, they have a body how you're doing.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Got a lot to do, a lot to talk about today.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm not feeling too well, actually.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yesterday, I think...

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, Patricia asked me to do some quick grocery shopping.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I came back, which you wanted me to get some cookies as well.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I got cookies, but I also found a...

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Something like the English version of Fig Newtons, if you know what Fig Newtons are.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I don't know, man, but those Fig Newtons, they're just sitting in my belly like 15 tons of bricks.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They're not moving.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So I have abdominal pains.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, what do you care?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey, first thing I want to do is thank everyone for sending in all these different versions of you don't own me.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Of course, the original by Leslie Gore, we heard that we've heard many times the one by the Civius Bitties.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We heard, oh, what is it?

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ross Poutina.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I have three more.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not going to play every single one, but I do want to play one at least once a day.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So why don't we play this one, which is sent to me?

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This, of course, was the revival of this song in the...

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was the first wives club when they actually sang.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And that's Bettmiddler, Goldie Hawn, and...

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Rrr...

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hold on, do I have any of my notes here?

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Bettmiddler, Goldie Hawn, and...

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, shoot, I don't know.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But it's you don't owe me.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
On your source code.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not just one of your many toys.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You don't owe me.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't say I can't go with none at their place.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Papa, papa, papa, papa.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And you don't tell me what to do.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And you don't tell me what to say.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And when I go out with you.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Papa, put me on display.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where'd it go?

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm a friend.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You don't owe me.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't try to change me in anyway.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You don't owe me.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You don't try to be boundless.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll never stay.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't tell you what I'll say.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't tell you what to do.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So just let me be myself.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Papa, papa, papa, papa.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't go with none at their place.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And when I go out with you.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And when I go out with you.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And when I go out with you.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can't go with none at their place.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And when I go out with you.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't go with none at their place.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And when I go out with you.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't go with none at their place.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And when I go out with you.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can't go with none at their place.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And when I go out with you.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And when I go out with you.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And when I go out with you.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And when I go out with you.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And when I go out with you.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So just let me be myself.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And when I go out with you.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So just let me be myself.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And when I go out with you.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And when I go out with you.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And when I go out with you.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And when I go out with you.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And when I go out with you.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And when I go out with you.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And when I go out with you.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can't go with none at their place.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,200
you'll know me, call it when we call you, tell me

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
shout out you'll know me

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,300
shout out you'll know me

117
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,100
how about you to tell me

118
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,020
fordi-to-l

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,460
shout out you'll know me

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,640
how about you'll know me

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
From the first wife's club, Batman Alert, Goldie Haun, and I forget the third one.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,600
Sure, you'll be able to tell me all about it. You don't own me on the daily source code.

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,680
So I've set up the Louis XIV now with multiple screens and I've got the breakout.

124
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,280
Everything has its place. You've got the breakout box. I actually did all the WDS networking of my airport

125
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,520
extremes. So now, not just the house, but the garden. And yes, if you set out to find outside my house,

126
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,960
you can absolutely enjoy the four megabit per second to Wi-Fi or the pipe, at least with Wi-Fi.

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,480
It's open access. So come on, y'all. Come on, have a good time.

128
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,880
The problem is, though, with the breakout box. It's like if I want to turn the mic off, I have to reach all the way over there.

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,360
See? So I've got to work on the ergonomics still of the quote studio.

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Let's see. What did I do? Oh, yes. Wait a minute. First of all, since it's 530 here, I think that the sun has

131
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,440
gone over the yard arm. So I think we can really get ready for the show. I bought a PC, everybody.

132
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,400
I bought a PC for downstairs because Christina really wants a PC. That's really mainly due to peer

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,400
pressure. We've been talking about this before. And one of the important things is all the cool features in

134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,800
MSN, which she doesn't have on the Macintosh. It's funny because I was talking to the photographer from USA today.

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,320
Well, he does. He's not from USA today. He's a photographer who was given the assignment by USA today.

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,360
And the first thing he said was, oh, yeah, on a PC, you can use the cool Nudge feature on MSN.

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,560
Like, yep, you got it. It's like drugs for these kids. So I had an interesting time setting it up.

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:56,960
I bought a cheap ass PC shit, a Packard Bill with a little 15 inch TFT monitor. So, you know,

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,840
the big box is stuck underneath the desk downstairs. And all those on top is the keyboard mouse.

140
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,160
And it's actually quite a cute little screen. And it's perfect for Christina. She loves it.

141
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,320
Had to install a Wi-Fi card. That wasn't too hard. I kind of remembered how to do it.

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,840
And getting the cabinet open was reasonably simple. And it's funny to look inside a PC again and say,

143
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,880
damn, there's so much room in there. So much room for stuff.

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,440
So what are my experiences with this? I have to say, the first thing you really notice is just a feel.

145
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,440
The feel of, it's like plastic. You know, a Mac is so, the finish is just so perfect, you know.

146
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,760
So, of course, you pay extra for that. But the PC experience of starting up is very interesting.

147
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,960
Because here you see that Microsoft and whoever the PC manufacturer has to be, it kind of like,

148
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah, they integrate in a weird way. So the setup of your computer goes through part Microsoft XP setup for Windows

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,120
and part setup that the manufacturer, whoever, yeah, who makes the boxes, I guess, whatever they deemed

150
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,920
necessary. So I've got all these icons and shit on the desktop. But in all, really, the setup wasn't that hard.

151
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Of course, it's impossible for me to figure out how to configure a network printer on this thing.

152
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,840
But it works. And another thing I noticed is the hard drive. Man, those things did crunch away.

153
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,520
It's just, I should record the sound of that hard drive. But I've stopped behind it. I've used it.

154
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:28,160
It's great, actually. And I've ordered the Skype wireless phone. So I can plug that into the USB port.

155
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Won't work on a Mac. At least the wireless one that I'm looking at so that Patricia can then

156
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,080
call the entire world at her heart's content, mainly to Holland, which is, I think I mentioned this before,

157
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,400
the most expensive country after Afghanistan to call, particularly mobile. It's like, you want to

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,880
paint $2.50 a minute. Of course, that's with the exchange rate. It gets a little wackier. But

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,360
well over a euro. And probably about a year and a half, about a pound a minute. It's just crazy.

160
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,080
So the PC is, it's in the house. It's working. And really, I have no problems with it. I think I could,

161
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,120
you know, work on a PC just as well. Don't know about the audio stuff. And of course,

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,480
there's weird things that have happened that, well, here's one for you. I also bought a transmitter.

163
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,720
Transmitters, we don't need no stink in transmitters. A transmitter from the sky digital box

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,920
in the living room. And I bought a little flat screen for Patricia, for the kitchen. And so that has

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,800
a receiver. And between those two, there's actually a digital link. That's from one room to the next.

166
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
Works very well, although I found that it does interfere a little bit with the Wi-Fi. Or let's say the Wi-Fi,

167
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,640
and I have three base stations, four computers that are polling for the best signal. And this,

168
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,960
I guess Wi-Fi frequency-based transmitter receiver for the television. It's a little bit,

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:00,720
I could just a bit much. We got a lot of stuff going on here. Got an email about this new plug-in

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,720
for audio hijack approach. Someone's been trying to get me to try and see the email was from Greg Walker.

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,960
There's this free plug-in that you can use called the audio inspector. And you can put it in

172
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,280
at the end of your effects chain on audio hijack approach. Actually, I'm going to do right now.

173
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,920
I didn't dare start to show off doing this. I'm actually going to add this effect as we speak on the

174
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,960
fly. I think it'll work. Elemental audio systems inspector. There we go. Okay. So I don't know if that

175
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,000
I heard something click. I don't know if it changed anything. Apparently, this will keep your levels

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,160
together. I don't know if it's supposed to keep your levels at a continuous rate so that it kind of

177
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,120
keeps everything in check. Or if it's just like a monitor, a mood-long clear. It's in the chain now.

178
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,920
I can see a great spectrum analyzer. Lots of winky-blinky lights. It looks very cool. I just don't

179
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,520
know if it's what it's actually doing. If it's doing me any good. But it should apparently keep the

180
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,800
the loud bits not too loud and the softer bits not too soft. And you can find all the links to this

181
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,480
plug-in, which is great eye candy in the show notes for today. I've also been meaning to tell you

182
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
about this show that's been on for the past couple of weeks on channel 4 around midnight in the

183
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,040
UK. It's called Anatomy for Beginners. This is the most unfucking believable show I've ever seen.

184
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,960
They have a small audience. So maybe 30, 40, maybe 50 people tops. In just a small television

185
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,160
studio. In the middle of this television studio, they have an operating table, not with all the

186
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,000
gear. It's more like an autopsy table because they literally, every night, they take a cadaver,

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,800
which is French for dead person. And they discuss a separate part of the body. And they cut the

188
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,800
parts out and show them to you and explain what it's all about. And they've got this this doctor.

189
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,280
It was this guy who narrated to this British book. He's nice. He's just going through all the motions,

190
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,440
explaining what's going on. But this doctor wears it like this cowboy hat, like a black hat,

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,760
and he's kind of like a, he's a German. It's really, it's really quite frightening. But it's really

192
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,400
something that is just amazing to see. And once you get through the initial shock of my god, they're

193
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:15,200
cutting a body open. It's really fascinating to watch. The other day they, they cut out the entire

194
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,800
intestinal track from going from the tongue all the way down through the esophagus. Obviously,

195
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,800
all the way through all the bowels, which they rolled out. It was seven meters, which is 720,

196
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,240
what is that? 21 feet of guts. And they just rolled it out over over all these tables and explained

197
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,920
exactly how it worked. And, you know, they've cut open testicles, which was a very uncomfortable

198
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
show to watch. But man, this is something that they definitely should get on cable in the

199
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,760
states. Because once you get through the, as I said, once you get through the initial shock, it's just

200
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,120
fucking cool to see. And, and you get a whole new perspective on really what your body is about

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
and what's going on. And quite honestly, I'm freaked out.

202
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,640
Viget, have you hacked into the feed yet? Excellent. Hello, Mr. Adam Curry. This is Evil Mastermind,

203
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,880
Dr. Steve. I just wanted to give you a big thanks for mentioning the radio adventures of Dr. Floyd

204
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,880
podcast on your show, the daily source code. Thank you also for crediting it to someone else.

205
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,960
You fell for my evil plan, the spread lies about Dr. Floyd perfectly.

206
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,680
Now, everyone will think that the very talented PwFenton put together the radio adventures of Dr. Floyd

207
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,760
when in reality, it's those two talentless hacks, Grand Pachoco and Doug Bryce.

208
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,640
Now, no one will ever know that they can go to Dr. Floyd.com and find out more than they ever

209
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,240
wanted to know about the show. Because I'm not saying anything about it. What? No, I didn't

210
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
did I? We didn't do. Because you Adam Curry should have done all fidget.

211
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,920
All right, I guess I deserve that. Radio adventures of Dr. Floyd, Dr. Floyd.com.

212
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,720
Some cool college radio podcast happening here in the UK. I got email from Michael Rumble

213
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,760
one of that, you know, something great happening with podcasting and independent music in the

214
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,560
UK is at Cambridge University, although he lives in Wabridge, which is near Gilford.

215
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,760
He set up a podcast to showcase the best in this town that's town, not the university

216
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,680
in a way of independent music. So, apparently what's happening is they're doing podcasts with

217
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,440
local bands, with a playing MP3s of local bands, and also giving their gig schedule, you know,

218
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,880
where you can see them play, and apparently other universities are joining in. York University

219
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,480
set up their own podcast, and what else? To Cambridge, York, and then there's of course the podcast

220
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,720
you take UK. You should check these out. They're obviously in the iPodot org directory by now,

221
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,600
but also linked from the show notes for today. I listen to a couple of the tunes, and I think

222
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,040
I'll probably be playing some of that pod safe music from one of those bands pretty soon because

223
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,720
of some good stuff there, and it'll be even better, I guess, or we can get an interview with them,

224
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,640
maybe even record something alive since, hey, they're from my hometown. Hi Adam, this is Brian Reed,

225
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,880
from rebeldad.com. I just launched the Rebel Dad Radio podcast this weekend. He had to show talking

226
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,440
about stay at home fatherhood. That's the glory of the medium for me, the incredible narrow

227
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,480
casting. At any rate, I'm now trying to count the number of stay at home dads. I've got at least

228
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,160
two, there's me and Dan Class from the bitterspill.com. Should I be considering you a third?

229
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,800
Well, I don't know. How do you classify or qualify as a stay at home dad?

230
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,800
If I don't have a job, is that also stay at home? If I just pod gas at home?

231
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,720
And I would presume that stay at home dad means that mom is out working, perhaps.

232
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,040
So we're kind of stay at home mom and dad, but I try to pull my way. I really do.

233
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,320
So it sounds like a cool, a cool little concept you got there though, so I'll be tuning in to rebel

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:18,320
dad radio. Checked out the beta of iPodor 2 the other day and it's like really beta.

235
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,360
It's discovered some interesting things right away. I was working with Andrew Grummit, one of the

236
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,120
developers of lead developers of iPodor. Of the lemon team, I should say actually.

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,400
This shit's looking pretty good. There's still some experiential things that I'm going to

238
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,440
provide feedback on, but it's very, very nice. It's definitely getting together there and localized

239
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,400
in eight different languages, including Dutch my favorite, but of course there are a couple of Dutch

240
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,280
guys on the lemon team. So I had some problems on the Mac. My plan for for Wednesday, sorry.

241
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:03,680
Tomorrow I have CNN international here to do an interview me. But then I plan on trying out

242
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:15,520
the Windows version of iPodor. I plan on trying out Jay Potter, Doppler radio, and NIMIC,

243
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,480
and there's a couple others because it's just so much happening on the Windows side of things

244
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,440
that it's crazy that I haven't played with these. I'm sure that there's some features in there that

245
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,040
that others could benefit from. So what actually that's one of the cool things of the iPodor 2

246
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:39,040
is this, when you subscribe, it's very visual and it shows you all the different podcasts from

247
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,040
this new feed that you subscribe to. It says and it's visual with a checkmark. You can see that's

248
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,520
only going to download the most recent one. You can also just catch up buttons so you can say just

249
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,000
download the most recent one from all podcasts if you were a way of vacation or if you're bandwidth

250
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,960
sucked and you can only get some at Starbucks for instance. So really, some very cool features.

251
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,800
Although there's one thing, I got a call from a girl who was doing an article for

252
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,480
scientific American. So you think she maybe have some technical inclination. She said,

253
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,880
I don't have an iPod, so I don't understand where the shows are. I see that they're downloaded,

254
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,680
but I don't know where they are, so still some work to be done on that. But otherwise,

255
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,320
man, looking great, really fantastic, and hopefully I'll be able to check out the iPodor X

256
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,800
data, which is on its way as well. Great. We're coming out with version two of everything.

257
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,640
This is very, very exciting. I've talked about Ron Bloom before, a good friend of mine, who I

258
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:53,520
ran a company with from 96.95 to 2000. His dad, Aaron, passed away over the just before the weekend

259
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,640
at a grand age of 90, though, I have to say. And so Ron, of course, was going to Atlanta,

260
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,200
where he's from, for the funeral. And it's beautiful. I've known Ron for a long time. And every single

261
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
Sunday, he calls home to mom and the dad. And sometimes to other members of the family, and I'm

262
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,840
actually emulated that a little bit. And in this case, Aaron passed away in his sleep. So,

263
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,200
you know, it's just a beautiful, beautiful life, a fantastic, you know, it's, I think, falling,

264
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:36,560
if you go in your sleep, that's probably probably the best way. And I got an MP3 feedback from

265
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,800
Atlanta, which I actually, I Skype him, I said, dude, I really want to play this. Excuse me,

266
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,520
on the source code, because it really shows how you guys were celebrating Aaron's life.

267
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,680
And the fact that you called it a wakecast, it just really tickled me. So, I got this wave file.

268
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
The beginning is a lot of ambient noise, because this is at the wake, and there's a lot of people,

269
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,240
and there's clearly some drinking going on. But I just wanted to share this with the source

270
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,160
code listeners, because it probably is the first wakecast, if you want to call it that.

271
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,280
And it's, uh, it's a good listen, here comes.

272
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:49,600
All right, everybody here said hello. Adam, this is Adam. So, uh, here we go, here's Shaila.

273
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,720
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

274
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh, great one. This is the lady's name, bitch.

275
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,720
Hello, Adam. This is Martha from Hot Latter.

276
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,360
I'm Adam, baby. Oh, that's the house. That's the room family signing off of the Z80 Wakecast.

277
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,640
So, uh, we miss you and we appreciate your kind messages and Z80s in a better place. We smile at all of it.

278
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,080
All right, Adam, talk to you later. We got to go eat some tissue. I was thinking about taking you on a

279
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,600
sensing tour of my plate, but there's no sushi left. So, uh, I'll have to wait till next time.

280
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,200
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Okay. I think that was actually done through an

281
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:43,200
AT&T recorded phone number. It showed up as a wave file, the first wakecast. And I put a link in

282
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,640
to, uh, to a page that was Adam Bloom, uh, Ron's nephew. Um, and so there's, uh, some, uh, some quick

283
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,520
time videos of, uh, of Ron's dad, which you definitely should check out. It's just cool to see.

284
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,760
So, the loop is complete. And I bet he is indeed looking down on us going,

285
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,920
what are you guys doing? Hey, uh, it's almost me guys. This is Simon Hodginson from

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,600
bizcast.co.uk. Just wanted to say great show. Also, just a wish you're listening to us.

287
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,360
A happy Chinese New Year. No, it's Chinese New Year on the 9th of February this year. It's the

288
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,080
year of the rooster. But if you're bumping Chinese people and you want to say happy New Year,

289
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,640
then in Mandarin Chinese, it's Shinyan Quaila. In Cantonese, it's Gong He Fat Choy.

290
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Anyway, you can impress them with your Chinese now. Anyway, he plenty of dumplings,

291
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,240
light fireworks and other great Chinese New Year. Thank you. Gong He Fat Choy. All righty. Thank you

292
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,400
very much. Uh, always good to know. Some sounds seeing tour options. And I keep updating the

293
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,600
feed the sound seeing tours.com. Every single time something cool comes my way. So, if you

294
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,640
not subscribe, you might want to check that out. It's on the homepage of curry.com. It's also

295
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:05,120
under sound seeing in the ipod.org directory. I posted on curry.com a picture of the birth house

296
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:13,680
of PG Woodhouse, author and humorist who apparently was born in Guilford. And there's some

297
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:21,840
sounds sound seeing tour suggestions that have come in for Guilford itself. I'll read this.

298
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,760
This is from with this come from. For us from Lloyd from Perfect Path. Okay.

299
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,040
22nd is more avenue near Stoke Park was the boy at home of Alan Turing, without whose mathematical

300
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,000
genius we might not be conversing like this from Turing's machine. It doesn't know if there's a

301
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,160
plaque there, but Lewis Carroll is buried in Guilford up on the mount, which is the hill that I

302
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,040
see in the front of me when I when you walk down on the high street. There's a statue of Alice

303
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,360
and Wonderland down by the river. So that is some the first day that is reasonable. See, I've been

304
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,600
thinking either it's got to be a beautiful day or it's got to be a really, really shitty rainy day.

305
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,480
I just don't think my equipment is is is is good enough for that shitty rainy day, but I think

306
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,680
the real rain ambient noise might be cool. So one of those days either really shitty or really good

307
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I'm off to do a sound seeing tour of Guilford. See if we can find the statue of Alice in Wonderland.

308
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,040
And I really screwed up a couple of times actually when I was talking about coverville,

309
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,120
Brian from coverville isn't indeed not from Canada. He's from Colorado just outside of Denver.

310
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,760
Why do I think that? I'd have no idea why I I'm sorry. I mean it's not bad to be called

311
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:50,000
Canadian, right? It's not bad. So Brian I was listening to the latest coverville show and he played

312
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,480
a version of I feel love that I had not heard before. You know the Donna Summerton and Patricia

313
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,040
actually walked in the office to damn. This is really good and I listen to the, oh man,

314
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,760
I don't have anything to drink here either. Let me just drink something out of the faucet.

315
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:27,680
I should have let the faucet run a little bit before I drank that. That was like pure copper coming.

316
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,040
I bet the color is now yellow. Hold on, I'll take you over here. I'll take you over here.

317
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,600
That's pretty clear. Okay, I just got the first mild full of nastiness.

318
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,760
So I looked in the show notes, one of the few times I've actually done that on a podcast,

319
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,520
but it's real handy on a music podcast. And and also heard Brian back announced it as the

320
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:59,680
Blue Man group with Venus Humb on vocals. Is that Venus Humb on vocals? And the Blue Man group,

321
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,440
familiar with them because I saw that they were in Vegas, I think, and I have a huge show there.

322
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,240
They probably have a touring version of it as well. And I'm kicking myself now that I didn't

323
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:18,000
go see them. We chose for like the new Cirque de Soleil. You know, I don't know, some kind of show

324
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,080
they were trying out. They're stupid because this Blue Man group stuff looks absolutely fantastic.

325
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
And I was able to find a video, which of course the podcast won't really help you with that,

326
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,320
but I found a video of this song. And it's like a theme footage, intercut with performance.

327
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,600
And I think it's from their show and probably from Vegas. Unbelievable. So I definitely wanted to

328
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,600
give the track a play because man, it's just like totally kicking.

329
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,840
The Blue Man group for Venus Humb. I feel love on your daily source code.

330
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

331
00:28:39,600 --> 00:29:09,600

Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Oh, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I

335
00:30:39,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you, I can see you,

336
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,600
I feel love

337
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,600
I feel love

338
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I feel love

339
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,600
I feel love

340
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,600
I feel love

341
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I feel love

342
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:24,600
I feel love

343
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I feel love

344
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I feel love

345
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I feel love

346
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,600
I feel love

347
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I feel love

348
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,600
I feel love

349
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I feel love

350
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I feel love

351
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I feel love

352
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,600
I feel love

353
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,600
I feel love

354
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Hi, this is David from the Audio Collective

355
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Recently I've heard a few complaints about the Firefox browser being slow

356
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Well, I've done some research and there seems to be a solution for the problem

357
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
As we all know, Firefox is a great browser

358
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,600
It's fast, it's less vulnerable to spyware and viruses and it has a wonderful pop-up blocking tool

359
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,600
With a few tweaks you can make Firefox even better

360
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
That's right, you can make it run even faster

361
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Now this is a warning, this is not for people who are on dial-up connections

362
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Only those people who have faster connections like DSL or broadband

363
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,600
This is actually taken advantage of a hidden option found in Firefox

364
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Now to do this you must open your Firefox browser 1.0

365
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,600
In the address bar of your browser, type in the following about colon config

366
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,600
That is AB-O-U-T colon C-O-N-F-I-G

367
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,600
This will bring up a menu in your Firefox window

368
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Next find the command line network.http.pyplining

369
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,600
And double click on that so the value equals true

370
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Next find networking.http.pyplining.max.com

371
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Dot max requests

372
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Double click on it and change it from 4 to 10

373
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Now what do these changes do when you're asking?

374
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
You're suited up!

375
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
The first one enables this tweak to happen

376
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,600
The second one is changing how fast Firefox can download the webpage

377
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,600
This makes it possible for Firefox to use more of your bandwidth when downloading webpages

378
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Once again, if you missed it, here are the steps to tweak your Firefox browser

379
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,600
You must open your Firefox browser 1.0

380
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
In the address bar!

381
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay, okay, I think we heard it the first time

382
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Because you can always go back and listen to the instructions again

383
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
I did this, it really works

384
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,600
On macOSX significantly...

385
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Sorry, it's the drunken sound again

386
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Significantly faster

387
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I really could tell of course

388
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I made the mistake of setting it to 100 the first time

389
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Instead of 10

390
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,600
And I was like, whoa, because of course I went to my regular porn banner sites

391
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
And the bandwidth was gone within another second

392
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,600
But yeah, changing that from 4 to 10 actually does work

393
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Great tip and love the audio version of it

394
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
So I don't know if it's really effective

395
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,600
If it's easy to just go to the webpage as provided in the show notes

396
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
But it does work

397
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I promised an update on the mixed-cast live beta

398
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
And then we talked about this, this is the Windows application

399
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Which is built with .NET

400
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,600
That was modeled according to James

401
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Well, the first email he sent me

402
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
You know a lot of

403
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
What this application is

404
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Was designed around what we had talked about here on the source code

405
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,600
And I think with trade secrets as well with Dave

406
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,600
And he actually built this application

407
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Which looks very much like a little mini radio studio

408
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,600
So we heard that I was wondering on the source code about how it was

409
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
How it was going, I'll just read this to you

410
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I've been slowly adding people to the beta for the past three weeks

411
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
One of my get some gnarly bugs

412
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
I stopped adding people to the big ones are fixed

413
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
I've had five releases during that period

414
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
I'm preparing for the six which has been really busy on this man

415
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
He's probably doing this all by himself

416
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
There's a big job

417
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Big change in the application are mostly configuration related

418
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,600
In fact the original demo that you link to is totally outdated

419
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Oh, okay

420
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Dude got to send me a new

421
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
A new

422
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,600
If you have a new screen grab or a screen movie

423
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
That's great, send it to me

424
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Response from test has been very positive

425
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Working hard to get the biggest remaining bugs squash before public release

426
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I'm avoiding putting a date on it now

427
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
But he can say soon

428
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
And then James winds up saying let me know when your windows box is all together

429
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
I'll send you an invitation

430
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Yes, I'm ready

431
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I am red day

432
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Of course, I don't have a microphone on the windows box

433
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Shit

434
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
I have to go get off the by one

435
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Or maybe if I get a webcam with the built-in mic

436
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Can I use that too?

437
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Well that worked

438
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
That's probably what a lot of people would use

439
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
And let's see

440
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Last one here was a cute email from Andrew Grummit

441
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
We talked about him earlier

442
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
One of the developers on the lemon team

443
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,600
So sitting on the bus listing to another one of those name that tune segments on daily source code

444
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
There's so much fun

445
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
On comes a tune that I recognize and I blurred out

446
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Can't explain that was the who right

447
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Guy to see next to me turns his head and looks in me

448
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Oh, I see

449
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Yeah, okay, it was listening to a music trivia game

450
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Gotta be careful, man

451
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Oh shoot, where is my trivia?

452
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
I had trivia lined up for today

453
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Hold on, that's weird

454
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Didn't, I was gonna finish off with that

455
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
And I don't see it on my playlist here

456
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Shit, now of course the Mac is

457
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Can you hear that?

458
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Listen to my Mac

459
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Okay

460
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Good, I don't know what happened and why I didn't load

461
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay, and we're gonna wind up today's show

462
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,600
To fill out the 40 minutes with another trivia hit quiz

463
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Hey Adam, this is a young poet with this week's hit test

464
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Okay, three tracks, next to the first one

465
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Wait, I hear cowbell

466
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Wait, wait, I want to replace that girl back

467
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
I heard some cowbell

468
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Fuck

469
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I got to know about it

470
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Next one

471
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Number two

472
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Don't waste my time

473
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
New shoes, jacked and grained

474
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
And number three

475
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Scready Politi

476
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
The first time

477
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I don't know, Scready Politi

478
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
With these, maybe

479
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Something like that

480
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
There you have it

481
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Okay, whoa, I love something

482
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
The answers, but first let me ask you something

483
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Yes

484
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
When you've only played the test for yourself to test your knowledge

485
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Or also if you think there are some kind of entertainment value in it

486
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,600
And if so, if it's a good idea to put this thing in a podcast

487
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Of its own

488
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Of course it's entertainment value

489
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
I wonder if you could share your thoughts about this

490
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Well, I kind of, if you do, please pause this playback

491
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
To do so

492
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm sorry

493
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I have to pause the playback to do so

494
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
I don't know

495
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
It's kind of like the drum cadence of the day

496
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
You know, it's like, do you really want to drum cadence of the day

497
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Podcast feed or you just want to hear it once in a while on the show

498
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I think you could certainly make one available

499
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,600
But I'd love to keep receiving your hit test as well

500
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,600
And I'd hate to have to share that with everyone

501
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Without doing it on the fly live

502
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
That's what I like the most I think

503
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Because exactly what Andrew said

504
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
You're sitting there and you're like, Adam, you fucker

505
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
You know, of course you know the answer and I don't

506
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I think that's that gives an extra dimension to it

507
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Really

508
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
If not, there we go with the answers

509
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
That's what you can number one

510
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Okay

511
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Tom Jones and she's a lady

512
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Yeah

513
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
She's all you'd ever want

514
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
She's the kind that I'd like to fault

515
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
And she's a lady

516
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
That was stupid

517
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
She's a lady

518
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Who knows, she's a lady

519
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Number two

520
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,600
That was, and people knew the benefit of the doubts

521
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Oh, no, I blew it

522
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,600
It's the same fucking track as the waste my time

523
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Oh, man

524
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
I got Screamy Politi right

525
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
That's all the same

526
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
And finally, number three

527
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Come on

528
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Screamy Politi

529
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Yeah

530
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
This is the word girl

531
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Word girl

532
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Ah, man

533
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Okay, so if you have to take

534
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Artists and title

535
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
A 50% of the jams, or I got

536
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Yeah

537
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
I got shit scores

538
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,600
So this concludes this week's hit test

539
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
I hope you had fun

540
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
See you in the next time, bye-bye

541
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I can't fucking believe it

542
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
It fell off again

543
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Oh, man

544
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Let's start at the beginning and at the end of the show

545
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Hold on

546
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
No, you better stay

547
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
God, I'm going to do that

548
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm telling you, this place is possessed

549
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
It's like a poltergeist has been throwing

550
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
There's no reason why it should fall on the ground

551
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
None whatsoever

552
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
All right, everybody, that was it for today's show
