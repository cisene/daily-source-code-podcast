00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Wacky stuff.

29
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
By the way, you're hearing that wild cherry sign.

30
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was like, what's that 1970s?

31
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a 78.

32
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Something like that.

33
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Really think I give a shit.

34
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000

Touch anything and touch anything.

44
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm an idiot.

45
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000

Ditto moaf few

52
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,400
What you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard.

53
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,400
At no point will you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.

54
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having left into it.

55
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh boy.

56
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,400
It's the end of the week almost the end of the month that your source code for the 29th of July.

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,400
In the entire week doing their source code every single day, truly the daily source code.

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Languette is doing a funky.

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
It's Friday.

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,400
The weather is nice here in the UK and we're going to be a little heavy on the pod save.

61
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I hope you don't mind.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
It's a little funky day.

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
My mom is in the hospital.

64
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,400
She just had just actually got a phone call that she finished her operation.

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
It's just finished.

66
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
This was a...

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Some kind of...

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Well, when I quite sure what it was yet.

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Some kind of abscess.

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Some kind of tumor thing in her hip.

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,400
It's been a bit of a bummer a year for mom.

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
But everything went well and I'll be able to talk to her in about an hour.

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
So I figured I'd send out some good positive vibes and play some cool rock music for her as well.

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
So we're ramping up.

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
We're getting ready for our vacation.

76
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
We'll show all of you an exactly one week from now.

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh, it reminds me.

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I've got a books and flights.

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Take a look at that.

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
As I said, weather is really nice.

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Kind of like high 70s, but not too much sun.

82
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I do have the Converre wearing away in the background.

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
You'll hear that and we'll get rid of some of the music.

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
And let me see.

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Got a couple of things we want to talk about.

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
The feedback has been enormous on three topics in particular from the past couple of days.

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,400
So we'll be looking at some email as well.

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,400
But to kick it off, I figured we'd play something that I pulled off of the pod safe music

89
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
network.

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
These guys were on the warp tour.

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I only know about the warp tour because my dear daughter Christina has been wanting to check out

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Let burn on the source cup.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm trying to see if I can tell they need school mode.

98
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Why you ain't trying to get away.

99
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
We don't have our new nation.

100
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
It's about to turn to respect for your reasons.

101
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Don't worry me, my cousin.

102
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400

Listen to the pod safe music.

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Listen to the pod safe music.

201
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Listen to the for the pod there.

202
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Listen to the pod safe music.

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Listen to the pod safe music.

204
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,600
took some time to actually explain the difference between the high quality guaranteed delivery,

205
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,800
you can stream it and listen to it in real time versus the subscription ban with lots

206
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,880
of suggestions, a lot of marketing-based suggestions, releasing stuff at different times.

207
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,480
Now actually there's a couple of pieces of feedback I'm going to play today about that.

208
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,320
But I have a question for you because I feel that we don't have time on our side in this

209
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,920
particular issue because podcasting is growing.

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
There's relatively a few people that actually still know what podcasting is about,

211
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
just because iTunes came out, doesn't mean the whole world understands it yet.

212
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,240
In fact, there's a whole new slew, this whole wave of press is coming back and I really get the

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,440
feeling that there's going to be another round of articles, maybe focus a little bit more on

214
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,040
the business aspects of podcasting, maybe hopefully more focus on the music aspects because

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,600
we're doing it. We are completely creating our own music industry only now is only for the

216
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,840
sales to start kicking in, which is happening slowly but surely. And I'm very, very excited about that.

217
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,800
But when it comes to the bandwidth, we've got a lot of mainstream media out there wanting to

218
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,480
podcast now and actually they are podcasting. And as I said earlier, the problem is the bandwidth

219
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,600
is not free. It may seem that way and maybe you think you have an account that offers unlimited

220
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,800
bandwidth but that's changing very, very rapidly. And as we've gone through this before, there's

221
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,720
kind of a slash dot effect certainly from the daily source code. If I mentioned someone,

222
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,560
lots of times they run out of bandwidth, they go down and it sucks. So we have to come up with

223
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,360
some fixes very, very soon. So here's a question for you. This is what I'd like some feedback on because

224
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
while we're figuring this out, while we're figuring out different ways of delivery, should we

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,400
be releasing stuff in the middle of the night, incentivizing people to subscribe, which by the way,

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,840
I think we should do anyway because subscribing to podcasts, it really is, it's magic,

227
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,280
you know. And when there's a new show which is shows up, you know, there's not going to be that much

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:19,840
benefit. I'm not even drinking a sense out when I'm actually, I put water in my coffee cup,

229
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,400
maybe that's it. Maybe just the the faint aroma of the sense here does it. By the way, I got

230
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,960
a call from the agency that represents sense here. Let's see if something comes out of that, huh?

231
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,440
Um, so, you know, there's a whole bunch of things that we need to work on, but I don't want to be too

232
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,920
late, you know, because as podcasting starts to grow, the small, you know, the small indie podcaster

233
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,240
is going to run into more and more trouble and just cost money, you know, ranging from anywhere

234
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,320
from, and I've really, and I've talked to a lot of people about this, and a lot of content

235
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,480
delivery networks, and a lot of bandwidth providers. And it's still, you know, if you're looking at

236
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,960
your per gigabyte transfer charge, it's anywhere from 10 cents to, you know, anywhere up to 3035

237
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,920
cents per listener. And, you know, again, this is what killed the streaming business. It is,

238
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,000
uh, besides the fact that you had to listen to that app, your computer, which wasn't all that

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,600
fantastic because we're to listen to the radio in your car, which is what the iPod gave us. Um, but

240
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,400
the, you know, it's not a very good model when every person you add to your listener-based

241
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,400
costume more money, unless you can offset that with revenue. So here's a question, and I want

242
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,400
you to really think about it. Let's say, um, okay, just for argument, say, I footage the bill.

243
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,440
And I provided free bandwidth hosting for anybody who want any indie podcaster that is,

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,320
who wants to do a podcast, whether you have 10 listeners, and I think every podcaster has at least 10

245
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
listeners, if you count yourself, your friends, and your family, which is great, you know,

246
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
but even that is still, each podcast is going to cost you, you know, three bucks. Now,

247
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,080
you can put that yourself, but if you start to grow and gain traction, and I guess ultimately,

248
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,120
it's cool if more people are listening to what you have to say, if you got it all for free,

249
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,920
would you be willing to take a obligatory advertising? So, if the offset of that cost was,

250
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,520
that you had an ad at the beginning or the end of your podcast that was inserted automatically,

251
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,880
would you be interested? Now, I'm sure there's a lot of people who would not be interested,

252
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,520
and that's okay. I don't want any geod shit about advertising or not. And, you know,

253
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,120
and I'm not talking about your typical radio spots, 20 seconds in your face bullshit, but yeah,

254
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
or, you know, there are many different ways, and I hope that we can change the face of advertising,

255
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,240
the way we're changing the face of music, but would you be willing to offset that? Because that's

256
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,160
a deal, I'd be more than willing to make, because I think that we could do that. And by the way,

257
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,400
not just an offset, but if it really started to take off, then, of course, you'd get a cut of that advertising.

258
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,480
That's what I'd like you to think about over the weekend. Don't email me immediately for two reasons.

259
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,920
When I want you to think about it, and two, my Gmail accounts pretty full. Hello?

260
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,720
Hello? You were supposed to start there on cue. Oh, man. Now, what the frick is going on here?

261
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,680
I've got the spinning beach ball of death. Oh, how do I hate that? Okay, so while that thing is spinning around,

262
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,760
like a jackass, let's go to some email then, shall we? U.S. Highways. A lot of feedback on the U.S.

263
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,920
Highways thread that we've been talking about. It actually looks like my computer is locking up here.

264
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,680
This is not a good sign. Now, I can't get to my Gmail, or as that totally hosed out as well. Hold on, let me see what's

265
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,840
my connection is still good. God, I wasn't such a such a vibe there.

266
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,480
Okay, still have the beach ball. Hold on a second. Let me try this. Hold on.

267
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,480
Okay, I know what the problem is. Actually, pause that for a second. It's the same frickin problem we've

268
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,640
had before. If you have a mounted, draw actually had my eye disc mounted. And when you want to play a song,

269
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,200
for some reason, Megaseg, you know, well, no, not for some reason. It tries to talk to your file system.

270
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,920
The file system is busy trying to get the shit rolling. So, I've just disconnected my eye disc.

271
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,160
Now, let's try it and see if it works now. My name is Kevin. And I am his youthful ward, Doug,

272
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
and you're listening to the strange brood.

273
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,160
We have a podcast where two guys come as you with a whole lot of funny from the Chicago suburbs.

274
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,400

275
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,960
including Dr. Phil's asschapers. And this really does.

276
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,440
We show my hand into this, you know, wet sticky goo and water began to just dump about us.

277
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,880
I walked around a few steps and obviously, you know, something was sticking in my foot.

278
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,360
Politics. Well, and you did work for the Howard Dean campaign. I did do a fairly

279
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,960
substantial amount of work for the Harry, Harry. Yeah, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry.

280
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,680
We do man on the street interviews, including this gem from the game lesbian Pride parade.

281

Hot Joe, content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

293
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,720
Alrighty, the UK podcasters doing fine. Grons steadily as we speak. It's about three

294
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,440
20 in the afternoon on Friday here at Curry Cottage in the UK, Patricia just came in.

295
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,080
And so what were you? What were you cursing about? So I've disconnected the IDisc and now it should

296
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,800
be. That little blip you heard in that previous promo was me disconnecting the IDisc. I guess that's

297
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,560
a problem, you know. And some things going something peculiar is happening here. It seems that

298
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,520
I've got this really expensive bandwidth provider that provides me with a huge mega pipe to the

299
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,320
house, but sometimes it's actually just say the service level is not up to par. That's easy

300
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
net. We've talked about that before. So I'll have to delve into that. I'll do that next week. I'm

301
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,480
just not feeling up to it right now. For app as long as I've got some bandwidth somewhere. So anyway,

302
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,840
we talked about the server bandwidth. That was in the previous bit. Now Willy Wonka, my goodness.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,680
I got a lot of response about saying that I'd heard the review on cinecast and that,

304
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,480
therefore, was not going to go see it. But I, oh man, I think that was a mistake. Let me just read a

305
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,200
couple of emails here. The most exciting one was from Dawn, Micelli from the Dawn and Drew

306
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,640
shows says boyfriend. I'd love to once he starts off like that boyfriend. We went to go see it and we

307
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,200
fucking loved it and I'm hardcore about the original. The DVD of the original is so interesting as they

308
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,560
interviewed the kids who have all grown up into freak accountants. Oh, can we please hire one of

309
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,400
them for the pod show? Yeah, of course. Go find them, girl. But then again, Johnny Depp makes

310
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
me tingling my swimsuit place. But then again, so the Gene Wilder, even with this terrible hair.

311
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,760
So I got a, just a crap load of, of comments on Willy Wonka and Christina actually

312
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,200
matches well. Madge Weinstein also said, you know, go see it. You're going to like it. So,

313
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,680
we're going to do that. Christina and I are going to go Sunday. We're going to go see it and I will

314
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:36,640
provide my unobjective review. Objective review. Objective review, obviously. So,

315
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,320
yeah, maybe it is something I want to see. I've just been such a die,

316
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,400
die hard fan about, you know, about about the original. And, you know, I told you I could watch it

317
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,000
anytime and still love it. So, I'm going to go. I hope I don't get disappointed. But from what I'm

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,640
reading, the feedback has been really astronomical from a lot of other people whose opinions I also

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,880
respect. So, let's see. Oh, I want to talk about the blue angel again, the NBA 3 that I have.

320
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm really loving this box. I don't know, it has this voice dialing. So, first of all, what it does

321
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,040
is when a call comes in, it'll announce the number with a voice and I have the English voice

322
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,080
loaded, which is kind of sweet. But you can also just say, you know, call someone, call them on their

323
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,560
mobile or at home or whatever, and it'll dial it for you. And I'll ask you verify if that's the

324
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,880
number you want to call. So, you don't mess that up. And so, I love that because I have it

325
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,360
clipped to my belt now and it's a pain in the ass to have to go look and see, you know, who's calling.

326
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,880
So, you don't have to do that. That's a very cool feature. And additionally, this transcriber,

327
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,920
where you can write on the screen and then it recognizes your handwriting, it actually works.

328
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,480
So, I'm kind of for going using the keyboard, which is a nice feature that you slide it up

329
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,360
and there's a built-in keyboard. I rarely ever use the pen for tapping it on the software keyboard

330
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,080
that's built into the interface, but now this transcriber thing, I'm all over it. I'm totally, totally

331
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,840
loving it. Here's a song that's not listed on the pod save music network yet, but it could be soon.

332
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,440
It's her and get away, country rock on the daily source code.

333
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:34,560
Time for a break from this downtown real regrets when I leave.

334
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:48,240
It's my way to be free. I need a gateway far away, a place where I can't stay. I can't wait,

335
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:56,880
and I won't delay, so I can't stand on the night with you.

336
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm traveling alone, finally on my own. Done with the past, if I'm too low,

337
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:17,520
I won't be certain to you. Don't know if I'll make your edges wait as soon.

338
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:27,600
No regrets when I leave. It's my way to be free.

339
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,400
I've done enough, way in the end.

340
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:04,080
I won't stay. With no fear, one was foggy then, it's crystal clear. There's no free in my own company.

341
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:27,360
It's my way to be free. I need a gateway far away, a place where I can't stay. I can't wait,

342
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,720
and I won't delay, so I can't stand on the night with you.

343
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm traveling alone, finally on my own. Done with the past, if I'm too low,

344
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm traveling alone, finally on my own. Done with the past, if I'm too low,

345
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,480
I can't stand on the night with you.

346
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,760
Yeah, I could be listed on the podcast music network. I meant it should be listed on the

347
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,920
podcast music network her, get away sent to me by just a little singer of the band herself.

348
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,600
Like that, very much. You know what it is? This is almost seems like a new music

349
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,000
Tuesday on a Friday, right? I've been in the middle of the hits for most of my adult life. I was on

350
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,000
big time radio and television since I was 19, and I really lived in the middle of this big

351
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,320
compressed top 40 sound, and I had forgotten how to listen to music, how to appreciate music,

352
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,680
how to, it's hard to explain. It's just like I had a complete overdose of the hits, and it was

353
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,400
very, very hard for me to, it's taken me actually years to get kind of back into living,

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,400
able to listen to music, and with this podsafe music, it's happening. I'm loving it. There's just

355
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,720
so much good stuff out there. It's funny I was talking to Don Katz, the CEO of Audible. We've

356
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,920
talked about him before on the source code, and we're talking about podsafe music, and he said,

357
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,320
so what kind of stuff is it? Is it any good? What's the quality of it? I said,

358
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,040
first of all, the recording quality is no different from somebody who's been releasing

359
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,600
records through a record company for years, because we've got the same tools, the exact same

360
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,600
tools that the so-called pros use is what the podsafeers are using. So then it comes out on a song,

361
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,440
writing a musician'ship, and talent, and artistry, and you know what, there is a cool, there's a

362
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,200
lot of it out there. Hey Adam, it's Chris for the financial aid podcast at www.financialaidpodcast.com,

363
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,400
with some audio feedback on interstate highways, two curiosities. In the United States with three

364
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,560
digit interstate city, indicates it's a spur loop. It's something that goes around the city,

365
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,680
so for example, if you're driving I-95, there's I-495, which goes around the city of Boston,

366
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,760
so you don't have to go through it. When you're driving out towards Worcester, I-90 goes through

367
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,400
Worcester, I-290 goes around it. The second thing is, when you look at the exit signs,

368
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,840
if the exit sign says exit 20 or exit 22, the little thing at the top of the sign, if it's on the

369
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,320
right side of the sign, it's a right hand exit, it's on the left hand side of the sign,

370
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,560
so left hand exit, if it's in the middle, then it's anybody's guess. Love your show, hope you

371
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,280
have, I have in a great time, back in England, hope to see you back in the state soon. Take care,

372
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,000
have a great vacation. Thank you very much, Chris, for so I tried to get to my Gmail earlier,

373
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
I think I can get to it now, because I had a couple more interesting tidbits that people sent in.

374
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,720
Uh, I don't know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's from Kevin, hold on, I want to get to the,

375
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,280
get to the right one, hold on a second, because it was really interesting.

376
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,840
Where is it? Okay, Brian Matthews is one of several people who sent this into me that Eisenhower

377
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,320
also required the one out of every six miles of interstate be straight, so in times of war,

378
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,000
they could be used as impromptu runways for aircraft, I find that fascinating. In fact,

379
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,200
I'd like to try that one time, I'm flying in this state. Also, a lot of information about the

380
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,440
TSA locks, I've got some links that I'll share with you on, um, in the show notes for today's

381
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,480
source code, there are indeed two officially sanctioned locks. One as we discussed is travel

382
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:46,720
century, um, but essentially if by mistake, the TSA cuts a lock, oh, that's Skype. Go away,

383
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,920
go away, go away, I'm busy. It's amazing, you know, you can't, there's no way to keep Skype on,

384
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,760
but the shut it up, you can be invisible, but people can still call you. Hold on a second,

385
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:04,400
let me give it to this. No, no, oh, it's cast blaster Mike, I'll get to you in a second, Mike,

386
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,400
we're gonna call it, uh, oh, we're gonna call, we're gonna call. Now, we're gonna call it a

387
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,720
fokk hola. Oh, uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

388
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,000
Sorry for that small interruption, um, but apparently, if you, um, if it has been cut off,

389
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,160
the, um, the lock that is you can get a replacement, so I'm gonna, uh, next time is Sanfurt

390
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm just going to go back to the Tummy store and see if I can get a new lock and ask

391
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,120
them exactly if they know what happened.

392
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,160
So stay tuned for more on that and highways and other extremely interesting stuff that

393
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,320
makes you feel good but doesn't make you richer.

394
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,200
Hey Adam, this is Jeff from podcastshuffle.com, great show, love the source code.

395
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,760
Just an idea for you and your bandwidth was, why don't you delay posting the MP3 file on

396
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,320
the website and encourage more people to subscribe.

397
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,440
If you're posting the MP3 up on, you know, curried.com, the same time that it ends up

398
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:18,360
in the RSS feed, you're really encouraging people to continue their existing actions.

399
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,600
Now I know you've mentioned the past like 60, 70% of your downloads are from the website

400
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,400
so you have to be careful not to upset anybody but, you know, if you really want to encourage

401
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,800
people to subscribe, that would be one of my suggestions is, you know, give this subscribers

402
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:45,000
a benefit and you know, encourage the web browsers, web browser users, you know, to subscribe

403
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,520
in order to get that benefit.

404
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,240
You know, it's happened in other medias like magazines.

405
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,640
I know as a subscribers at Business Week magazine, I get it before it shows up on the

406
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
newsstand.

407
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,680
I've had a couple of video games, mags, where, you know, since I subscribe to their magazine,

408
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,640
I got a, you know, like a free demo CD and if I didn't subscribe to it, like if I picked

409
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,080
it up at the newsstand, I would have to pay extra for that.

410
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,680
So just a thought, maybe it would work for you, talk to you later.

411
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,400
All right, thank you very much.

412
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,440
So we were talking about that earlier and again, I want to see if what we talked about

413
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
and again, this is something I want to think about over the weekend, don't send me email

414
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,240
immediately, but think about if you got everything for free in perpetuity, but it would

415
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,560
be offset by advertising and above a certain level, you would actually start to make

416
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,000
some money on that, would you be interested?

417
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,360
Do I hear my phone about it to ring?

418
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,000
You know, I've got to just shut off all communications when I'm doing the show is too much

419
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
incoming.

420
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
All right, let's wind up the week with our anthem.

421
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I just can't get enough of it.

422
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,480
I have this on my earphones all the time, singing along like a hurt cat.

423
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,000
Cruise Box FCC, dig in.

424
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,800
We back last summer, when mainstream radio was such a fucking bummer, no ending music, nothing

425
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
to funny.

426
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Clear channel motherfuckers, edit for the murder.

427
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,800
It's a lie, I heard it fall.

428
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Now you can't have it all.

429
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:32,000
I heard it on a podcast, rockin' fucking radio, you wanted it, you got it.

430
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Just downloaded a part it on a podcast, no one's gonna stop you telling KFC seats, pick it, pick it,

431
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:51,400
the revs, shows off.

432
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:59,000
Do you remember your first computer, that place that shit was like a freakin' roater,

433
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:07,000
now we go by by downloading files fast, this meant to everyone who's ever done a podcast.

434
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's his duty, now you're seeing each and every nation.

435
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Real is got to do its own multiplication.

436
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Me, that song, sing along, mash it up from the tip.

437
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Real fucking loads of out-of-gurn things in somebody heard the call.

438
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Now you can have it all.

439
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Everybody have made it.

440
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Everybody has made it all.

441
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
People who are in theuktion of T Sound.

442
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
All with no evidence to make it clear before the end of a podcast is broken-

443
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Rockin' fuckin' radio, goin'

The rummaging of all

459
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,940
The rummaging of all

460
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,500
The rummaging of all

461
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,160
Still sorta like this

462
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,080
Still sorta like this

463
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,780
The rummaging of all

464
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Sorry had to sing along, couldn't help it

465
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,880
You know what's so great about this song, you'll never hear it on mainstream radio, because it's got all those bad, bad words in

466
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Here's box, tell the FCC to stay in our world

467
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,880
Alright, that's it for the source code for today, why not up the week

468
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Hope you enjoyed it

469
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
If you're interested in any of the songs that you heard just head on over to

470
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,880
DailySourceCode.com or www.curry.com

471
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
And as you can find links to everything we talked about, and of course all the pod save music

472
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Alright, so I'm going to go talk to Casplaster Mike, we had a call scheduled for six minutes ago

473
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,880
And after that we call him my mom, apparently everything's fine, so just see if I can give her some more positive vibes

474
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,880
And I appreciate you tuning in, if you want to send me feedback out of Maccurry.com

475
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Please don't attach files, at least not through the weekend, because I'm still trying to get the ratio of usage of my Gmail to the ever growing

476
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,880
