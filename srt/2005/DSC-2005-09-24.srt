1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Saturday Night Special coming to you from

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
the Curry Condol.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,560
It's San Francisco, California, tell us you're a Charlie, two, four, five.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,980
Let's talk, talk, talk until you talk to yourself and to the ground with what, what, what,

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,780
until you've taken me and danced around this love love the one you never knew could be

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,560
found that stuck, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,520
we are walking on my tightrope of words and crossroads, and I hope that the words I

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:51,120
choose will come back to haunt you, I wish wish that you would listen the first time

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,740
time time because it would save us all of this, it's a crime crime crime that we're wasting

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,860
all this precious time time time time, we have talk, talk, talk, talk, you say I'm never

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,700
Sta pod, look at it this way, all of their say it's a good thing, babe that, let

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,700
That I started in the first place

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,700
But I thought I'd better, better, better, better, better

15
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Let's talk, talk, talk, can tell you talk yourself into the ground that's walk walk walk

16
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Until you've taken me around this town, skirting the issues, you knew it would come round soon

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,700
I wish you'd listen the first time through

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I heard you said that twice before, yeah, I already said that twice before

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,700
I heard you said that twice before

20
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,700
I already said that twice before

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Straight from the Podsafe music network, Cheryl B. Engelhardt

22
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,700
And talk, talk, talk, talk on the daily source code

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,700
It's not often that we meet each other on Saturday night

24
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,700
And I realized that if I were doing this over in the cottage

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,700
The cottage, then you probably would hear it Saturday night

26
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
Because I'd be eight hours ahead of the ball

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
So this may be Sunday for you, we hear this show

28
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,700
I'm back at the condo, I was in Vegas last night

29
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,700
And we didn't have a chance to speak on Friday, no show

30
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,700
I just got way too busy with people over visiting

31
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Our office from out of town

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,700
And we had some stuff we were talking about with them

33
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,700
And I just took up time and didn't really have all the necessary time to do the show

34
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,700
And I find it sometimes very difficult to put a show together

35
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,700
If you have to fit it into a certain slot

36
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
It's like a go-paying to picture and do it between 130 and 3

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,700
It still is kind of a creative process, I think

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
But there's a lot to talk about

39
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Because I really wanted to get it out while I was still fresh

40
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,700
And I was sitting here on the couch in the condo

41
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
I still haven't received the shipment from J.C. pennies

42
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
And don't even get me started on that crap

43
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
So I have candles burning everywhere

44
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,700
To basically keep the place kind of lit

45
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,700
But it's been beautiful night, I can see all of the city

46
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,700
I can see the marina, it's really quite a sight

47
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,700
And I find myself more and more in the situation

48
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Where I'm thinking to myself and I'm talking kind of with my inner voice

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,700
I think and man, I should be podcasting almost all the time

50
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,700
That would be much more convenient than trying to remember all this cool stuff

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Every second is like, oh yeah, I should talk about that

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Oh, maybe I should talk about that

53
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,700
So I thought maybe what we do is we'd catch up on some email

54
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Because there are two topics really that just prevail

55
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
And there's not a day that doesn't go by

56
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,700
They don't get 15 to 20 different comments on both the biodiesel

57
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,700
And biodiesel and that other thing

58
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Oh yeah, the hate podcasts, but we've kind of closed that chapter, I think

59
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Let's see, there was also, well, those have been some other interesting little tidbits in there

60
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Oh, the sound advertising, of course

61
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,700
And it's interesting how many people have been anchored to different objects

62
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,700
Some of them are pretty interesting

63
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,700
So to make this show completely different

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,700
I was going to play just a couple of tunes

65
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,700
To mellow stuff or mellow stuff that I pulled off of the Podsake music network

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Just kind of scouting around and there's an amazing array and variety of music

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:21,700
You kind of expect me to think independent, you think, well, there's going to be a lot of alternative rock and punk

68
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,700
See, what up? Well, I mean, and that's in there too, and actually a lot of it is very, very good

69
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,700
But if you're looking for jazz or hip hop or R&B, it's in there as well, it's definitely cool

70
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:42,700
And I've played, what I'll do is, I'll get all my thoughts together to tell you about the adventures and vagas

71
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Which actually this morning, or what was it, it was around noon when I finally got up

72
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:58,700
And walked down to get some breakfast in downstairs in the casino eatery part of the wonderful Venetian hotel

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,700
I actually started doing a sound scene tour

74
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,700
And I got all the way, you know, I was playing some slots and it just didn't work for some reason

75
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,700
I think there was too much noise, there really was too much noise

76
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I have to listen to the stuff that I did record and see if any of it is worthwhile and I'll play it for you

77
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:23,700
But right now, let's see, oh, yeah, this was a mashup that arts and make mark for mashuptown.com

78
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,700
It's called All Rocks Down, done by Unknown

79
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,700
So if you want more information on this, I'll let you guys know that I would have mashuptown.com

80
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Saturday night, just chilling, catching up with y'all

81
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

82
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

83
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

84
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

89
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

90
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

91
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

93
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

94
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

95
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

96
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

97
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

98
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

99
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

100
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,700
i'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

101
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm getting all the way

102
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

103
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

104
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm getting all the way, I'm getting all the way

105
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:37,700
And I can't even go to the grocery store without someone's that clean, and I start with a clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean, clean,

111
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,240
Hey, look, it was a reason to go to Vegas, right?

112
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,200
The reason why is because Jamane Dupree was celebrating his 33rd birthday and was throwing

113
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:25,200
a, I would say, a medium to large scale party, I think 700 people were on the guest list.

114
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,960
And I was invited to go meet with these folks and then after that go to the party.

115
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,920
The meaning was, of course, about potsafe music and the version people, by the way, are very,

116
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,200
very cognizant of what podcasting is, but damn if anyone was listening to it, podcasting

117
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
that.

118
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
It's unbelievable.

119
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
So also, you know, I always say, what's your favorite podcast?

120
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,040
And, you know, usually it's, you know, if I were to ask, have you ever listened to a podcast

121
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,280
and say, oh, yeah, sure, you know, it's much easier to kind of play it off.

122
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,920
But if you say, what's your favorite podcast, then, you know, the person has to think for a second

123
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,520
before being able to answer and, you know, by then they probably realize that just

124
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,440
might as well be honest and say, I've never listened to one.

125
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,800
So there was one guy who he was pretty turned on.

126
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
He was switched on.

127
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:21,720
He, a younger guy who works for the label, but he, he's a junior guy.

128
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,120
And when it comes to, so that was really about, you know, what kind of broader distribution

129
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,000
can we get for some of our podsafe artists?

130
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,600
I mean, we're creating stars and there's hits here.

131
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,240
You know, this is, this is amazing.

132
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
There must be more avenues and more ways to distribute.

133
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,560
And of course, there are.

134
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,120
You know, that's basically what hip hop is these days.

135
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
It's all distribution deals.

136
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,840
It's really small record labels, which, of course, do grow big, some of them.

137
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,120
But they have distribution deals with the majors.

138
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,640
And that's a, it's a, it's a pretty fair way of doing things I have to say.

139
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,240
And it's a very successful part of the music business, probably one of the most successful.

140
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,880
So the other part of the topic of conversation was the reverse, you know, can we play some

141
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
of your music on our shows?

142
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,640
And I was interesting, everyone's like, yeah, that's great.

143
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
You know, fantastic.

144
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Of course, we should do that.

145
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,160
So it'd be good to realize that there's a, there's probably an issue about that.

146
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,800
And you know, the lawyers may take may, may not agree.

147
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,560
And all of them assured me that didn't seem like that would be too much of a problem.

148
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,080
So we'll see.

149
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,280
And then the party was held in the Venetian hotel where I was staying as well.

150
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,320
And, uh, yeah, there was a dress code.

151
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
It was a 50s and 60s rat pack.

152
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,280
And I didn't have my rat pack outfit with me, unfortunately.

153
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,400
So mad dashed to go find a black jacket and a bow tie and a hat, yeah, I have a picture

154
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
somewhere.

155
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,960
I'll get around to putting that up eventually.

156
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,080
And yeah, so the party started out in like 10 or 11 or something like that, but really

157
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,600
didn't start it until around midnight when people really started coming in.

158
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,480
And I felt like it was in a music video.

159
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,200
It was, it was unreal.

160
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:20,040
It was a very classy, beautiful, you know, separate room of this, you know, really for

161
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:29,600
private functions of this club in the Venetian hotel, T-A-O, I think it is yet tau.

162
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,320
And it was an R&B video.

163
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm telling you, that's exactly what it was.

164
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,760
You know, the way the tables were said beautifully.

165
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,400
They were nice couches.

166
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,160
There was a great DJ, man, I don't, I didn't get his name, but he was awesome.

167
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,560
It was loud, you know, so conversation was still kind of possible.

168
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,480
You could drink anything open bar, just tons and tons of orders and stuff.

169
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,560
And, you know, it's like some real major people from the music industry, some of them

170
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,920
who, who I knew a lot, I didn't.

171
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,160
And just all kinds of types of people.

172
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,320
And I was just like, whoa, I'm just going to sit here and observe.

173
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,040
And actually I wrote down a couple of the names I wouldn't forget.

174
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,720
Usher, usher, very, very laid back guy, he and his wife were there, Nelly, let's see, who

175
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
else was there.

176
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,440
Oh, no, what's interesting is, everyone's smoking cigars.

177
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,280
Every single one of these guys is smoking cigars.

178
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,320
In fact, the thing now is you have to walk around with either a box, so, you know, just

179
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,160
like the one you buy in the cigar store, a box of Cubans.

180
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,160
So there's, you know, some people walking around with a box of Cohibas, or you have your

181
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:56,640
ostrich skin, ostrich skin leather, portable humidor box with your cigars in it, with

182
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,120
your selection of cigars.

183
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,600
And man, you got a puff on those suckers, a lot of cigars smoking going on.

184
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,880
I was one of 10 white people there.

185
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,920
I should, I should point out, which makes no difference, but it was, just totally, totally,

186
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
totally different world.

187
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
I've not been in the R&B and hip hop world at all.

188
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Shug Night walked in, I'm telling you, I was in a video clip, I'm like, you know, what's

189
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,320
next to Poc and Biggie come walking in?

190
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,520
Oh, yeah, one point, so it may be like 10 of us sitting in one of these tables and kind

191
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,560
of the booth and, you know, two huge body guards or guard, like security guards, I should

192
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,240
say, come over and say, hey, can we ask you to clear out this space because Michael Jordan's

193
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
coming?

194
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,200
I'm like, well, that's a cool party.

195
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,640
I said, yeah, I'll bow down to Mike, he never showed up, by the way, that corner was

196
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,040
cleared out for the entire night and Michael Jordan never showed.

197
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,360
And nor did Jermaine debris actually, he didn't come in until, like, 1-15 or 1-30 and

198
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,400
I was not, not too early before I left, but that Paris Hilton came in with her hiltonets

199
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,880
that's like five or six girls, all little Paris, you know, kind of looking girlies.

200
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,240
And I have to say that she's, it's kind of sad when you see what she's doing.

201
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,920
I mean, no one's paying attention to her, I'm really no one, or more than, oh, there's,

202
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,120
you know, there's that Paris Hilton woman, and she came in, she immediately walked around

203
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,320
the entire joint with her cell phone to her left ear, which clearly she was not really

204
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
talking to anyone.

205
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,560
It's almost like her shield, or, you know, whatever she has, or just something, like

206
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,360
it's almost like sucking your thumb, I guess, maybe it's her security blanket.

207
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,720
And then she and the, and the Hiltonets got up on, on a couch, you know, and danced, and of

208
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,560
course, there were photographers there and a couple of TV crews.

209
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,560
And it was kind of, you know, just like, I don't know, the thing was, no one was really

210
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,000
paying attention to her, and, you know, wherever the cameras were, she'd kind of move in

211
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,840
and then she'd just start dancing in front of the cameras, it's the weirdest thing.

212
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
It really is.

213
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,640
She smells great, though.

214
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yeah.

215
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Yeah.

216
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,760
She was walking by and she stopped kind of near me and I'm like, I love sniffing women.

217
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,960
You can only do that when you're talking, like me.

218
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Okay.

219
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,080
I'll tell you about some of the other guests who showed up, play a song first.

220
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,600
It's another one for the, off of the podcast music network, Carmen Tyler, I played a cover

221
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
version that she did.

222
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,240
I don't know, this may be a cover as well, I'm not too sure, but it showed up on the

223
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
podcast music network.

224
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm like, okay, I do like the way she sounds.

225
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,600
She was a saturday night special, the daily source code, just chilling.

226
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,560
This is make believe.

227
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Only make believe.

228
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,560
I love you.

229
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Only make believe that you're lovely.

230
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Others find peace of mind and pre-tending.

231
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Couldn't you?

232
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Couldn't I?

233
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Couldn't you?

234
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Maybe my lips are blending in a fancy kiss or two or three might as well make believe

235
00:19:49,560 --> 00:20:05,920
I love you, for to tell the truth how to, though the cold and brutal fact is, you and

236
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,560
I have never met.

237
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:17,000
We need not mind each other's peace and cues.

238
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If we put our thoughts in practice, we could banish our regret.

239
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Imagine we most, anything we choose, we could make believe, I love you.

240
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Only make believe that you're lovely.

241
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Others find peace of mind and pre-tending.

242
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Couldn't you?

243
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Couldn't I?

244
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Couldn't you?

245
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Couldn't you?

246
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Wouldn't you?

247
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Couldn't you?

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Couldn't you?

249
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Couldn't you?

250
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
to

251
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
H

252
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
H

253
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
H

254
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
H

255
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
H

256
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
H

257
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
H

258
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
H

259
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Carmen Tyler make believe on daily source code 2 4 5 the date is September 24th Saturday

260
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
255

261
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Just

262
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Getting back to the germane to pre-party who did eventually show up and a janitor as well. He's a he and janjax and lived together for I don't know

263
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Five six years maybe

264
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Samuel L. Jackson was there men. He's a party animal that guy is damn oh man

265
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Sam gets down and he shaved off all the facial hair and he looks really good after say

266
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It was really really good

267
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And

268
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let me see L. A read

269
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Was there these just all the people I recognized. Oh yeah, and then

270
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So you know, fashionably late, but perfect timing is always Mariah Carey comes in

271
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And she has a some kind of massive bling watch that she that she gave to germane

272
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And so of course immediately cameras going off and everyone huddling around that and

273
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But it was completely just a music video. It was awesome

274
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And there was me you know six foot four white guy with a freaking black hat on with a white band and a black bow tie

275
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So anyway, I left around one thirty quarter two

276
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That and it went on until like five like now

277
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Man, I'm just way too old for that and besides I want to go I want to go back home

278
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I want to go back to my girls

279
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's it's not so much being away from each other

280
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's the time difference that is just such a killer eight hour time difference so

281
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You know, we're on the exact opposite ends of

282
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The body clock you know when I'm just getting up she's winding down and vice versa

283
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And you know, so some I mean it's like I could wait until midnight

284
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And then you know that's 8 a.m. and she's getting Christina off and so then after

285
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Wait until 1 a.m. you know that it's 9 for her and

286
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And then I'd be like dead tired. It's just very weird

287
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So I'm going to go home at the end of the week and I'm very much looking forward to that

288
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm wondering what I should do with all this email

289
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I maybe I should just put a stop behind all of the topics that we've been discussing

290
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Because I read it all I love all these comments on on this on the sound

291
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Vertizing on the bio diesel

292
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I mean I have so many different

293
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You know sources now to go to I'm really going to do that by the way

294
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I am getting a diesel and I am going to run it on you know vegetable oil or

295
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Whatever

296
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I

297
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Totally believe that's the way to go

298
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
We've just been marketed away from from the obvious the obvious other natural resource that we have

299
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I think we can grow it

300
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What what a concept we've got farmers in this country they can grow our fuel

301
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But I don't know if you can grow enough of it fast enough

302
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You know we seem to need

303
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Was it 20 million barrels a day or something like that maybe it would be more unbelievable

304
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
God this I really did want you to hear this you know that jet blue plane

306
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Um

307
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That landed at LAX

308
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh my my iTunes here so it might what's that oh yeah

309
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I have the window open to give us some sometimes a fire truck goes by it's perfect San Francisco sounds

310
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Um

311
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So there was a jet blue aircraft and this was earlier in the week that

312
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
How did it made an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport

313
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And the reason why is because although all his gear was down his nose wheel was down

314
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Um but the wheels were turned 90 degrees

315
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So you know that's probably the worst uh

316
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
They don't roll very well if they turn 90 degrees

317
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And uh there was a lot more behind this entire story

318
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Uh of what you know what went on because this was clearly a maintenance issue and you know

319
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well there was there was some pilots up there who were uh doing a damn good job of uh getting

320
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Information figuring out um you know what they were going to do

321
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And uh

322
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And uh

323
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And uh

324
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And uh

325
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Recorded some of the air traffic control

326
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Conversation between ATC and the pilots of the jet blue flight and he put it out

327
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Um on Friday

328
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And it's uh I don't have a queue to up hold on a second let me just uh

329
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I love their cheer

330
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's so cool

331
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That actually fits. Yeah, let him explain

332
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Come on in the next episode eight and a half of fly with me

333
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm Joe Dion and I'm a short addition to episode eight for you

334
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I usually wait to have a whole show put together before I put something up

335
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But something happened yesterday that I was able to catch at least partially on tape

336
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And I thought you'd like to hear it

337
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It actually relates better to an upcoming episode I'm planning

338
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
About the responsibilities of being captain

339
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And I've spoken to a number of experienced captains about their philosophies

340
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
What it takes to be a good captain and one piece of advice that keeps coming up

341
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Is don't let people talk you into a decision that is not your own

342
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I've been told that the people around you who are offering you suggestions and information

343
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Are always acting in good faith

344
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But they're not necessarily onboard the aircraft with you and they don't necessarily have to live with the decision you make

345
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
As captain you have to live with the decision

346
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Listen to this event as it unfolds and hear how this captain keeps on top of the situation

347
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And how he tries to get the best information possible before he goes and makes up his mind

348
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Off a fair bag

349
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We expand the landing to the air shock absorber's pulse

350
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It shows maximum speed 280.67 the landing gear is currently down. I have three grades

351
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm also showing the wheel, nose wheel, steering pulse

352
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I have reference to the up top

353
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It tells me not to retract the gear

354
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It also tells me that there's a possibility that the nose gear is candid 90 degrees

355
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Ball off center

356
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
This is the same anomaly that occurred with 5.03

357
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you copy so far?

358
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Over

359
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Standby is like a weekend figure out a close-up action for you

360
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, thank you so much

361
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The aircraft is pretty similar to the FCA

362
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It was written up and it was signed off

363
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Do you want to look back at that

364
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So anyway, what do you just said there by the way that the aircraft has experienced that yesterday

365
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And it's been signed off that means that the mechanic signed off that the problem was fixed

366
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And someone's getting their ass fired over that

367
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I probably worse worse than that you get in the trouble with the FAA

368
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So definitely go listen to the fly with me episode 8.5

369
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That's just phenomenal stuff

370
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And no one has that audio I haven't seen or heard any news media talking about it

371
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And it's great stuff

372
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And just when you listen to the captain of the airplane, he's really got a shit together

373
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And he's really really smart

374
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And you have to listen to it

375
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So well worth it

376
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Let me see

377
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What else did I have

378
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It was cool

379
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh

380
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
If there was anything

381
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I had the wiki stuff

382
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
For the show notes for the daily source code

383
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I requested that we all kind of look at the idea for a wiki for show notes

384
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So everyone could contribute

385
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And part of the reason is all this email

386
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If we could have people putting stuff on up on a wiki then

387
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You know, you would basically have all of that

388
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
That info as well

389
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's funny stuff too

390
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's really really cool

391
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
They write to me, you know, they would write it on the wiki

392
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Maybe because it's not just like comments on a on a web log

393
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But it's more of a

394
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Collaborate into in the notes as we go along

395
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Good point about not having the show notes

396
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
In the RSS feed because they would basically be posted later

397
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I have an idea for that

398
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But you know, we'll we'll get to that bridge

399
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Eventually first let's see if we can figure just get the show notes going

400
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Alrighty, let's play another song

401
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Ah yes, of course

402
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
This is

403
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hmm

404
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's my baby

405
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's my baby Patricia

406
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
One of my favorite soundtrack

407
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Come on baby

408
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I've got you

409
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Under my skin

410
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I've got you

411
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Deep in the heart of me

412
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So deep in my heart

413
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That you're really a part of me

414
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I've got you

415
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Under my skin

416
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I've tried so

417
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And not to give in

418
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I sat to myself as a fan

419
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Never will go so well

420
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But why should I try to resist

421
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Baby, I know so well

422
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I've got you

423
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Under my skin

424
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I sacrificed everything

425
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Come on my foot is sick

426
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I've had an unirienced battle

427
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The war in the world

428
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The calm's in the night

429
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The repeats and repeats in my head

430
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Don't you know

431
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No little fool

432
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You never can win

433
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You're your mentality

434
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Wake up your reality

435
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let's go

436
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Let's go

437
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I sacrificed anything

438
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Come with my foot is sick

439
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I've had an unirienced battle

440
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We're inspired to warn and voice

441
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It comes in the night every piece I want

442
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You can't see my ears

443
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't you know it all for

444
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You never can win

445
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You show mentality

446
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Wake up to reality

447
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But each time that I do just the thought of you

448
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll make me stop before I begin

449
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Because I've got you

450
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Under my skin

451
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And I feel you

452
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Under my skin

453
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And please stay there

454
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Under my skin

455
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Where is your baby?

456
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Patricia Pai

457
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That's her dad's band by the way

458
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
His big band

459
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Her dad is 80

460
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And so are most of the guys in the band

461
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
In fact when they were recording

462
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They were doing like a mini CD

463
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Four tracks

464
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
This is maybe like four years ago

465
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You know it would say

466
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey, where's Pete?

467
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And on that piece having Andrew done today

468
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
He'll be here next week

469
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That's amazing

470
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Well, this was kind of fun

471
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And it's funny because

472
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's only been 33 minutes

473
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I thought it would be much longer

474
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Even with the songs in there

475
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Wow, cool

476
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then why don't I play

477
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
See if I can play just one last

478
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's do a non-pod safe

479
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Let's break the rules

480
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah

481
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Stick it to the man

482
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh man

483
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Something I've been going around

484
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Am I head all day?

485
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I think I have it here

486
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I don't know ready

487
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So this actually might work for you

488
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
On a Sunday morning

489
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
If you're

490
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That's because that of course is when you're going to be listening to this podcast

491
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Okay, here we go

492
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah, and I won't come back after this

493
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll just play this song

494
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So if you don't like it then

495
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Then you can just go to the next track

496
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Go to the next podcast

497
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Hey, I'll talk to you in Monday

498
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Everybody have a great Sunday

499
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And God bless

500
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I see us in the park

501
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Throwing the summer days

502
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Of imagination in my head

503
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And words from my heart

504
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't need to do the winds

505
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Baby, I don't need say

506
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't wanna go

507
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You wear my travel

508
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But there's so much love

509
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Then next week

510
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And the sea of life

511
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes, I'm about to love

512
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The night is about to die

513
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
On a wall

514
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We lay beneath stars

515
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
One day I love a street

516
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's seen through the eyes of my mind

517
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And I reach out for the far

518
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Of me that lives in you

519
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And only your two hearts can find

520
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But I don't wanna go

521
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You wear my travel

522
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But there's so much love

523
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Then next week

524
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And the sea of life

525
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But there's so much love

526
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Then next week

527
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And the sea of life

528
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And the sea of life

529
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yes, I'm about to love

530
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You wear my travel

531
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But there's so much love

532
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Then next week

533
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And the sea of life

534
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And the sea of life

535
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And the sea of life

536
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And the sea of life

537
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And the sea of life

538
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And the sea of life

539
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Now I know I said I wouldn't come back

540
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But

541
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So those who shut all the head

542
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Won't hear this now

543
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Will they?

544
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It'll be our dirty little secret

545
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I was just gonna say

546
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
As an afterthought

547
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Those exact from the record company

548
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You know what really turned them on about podcasting

549
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It wasn't the freedom of it all

550
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah, that was all right

551
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That was kind of interesting

552
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
What was the number one thing that turned them on

553
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Is the numbers of listeners

554
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And they're just like, what?

555
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
How many people?

556
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
They could not believe it

557
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
All right, I'm out

558
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Another pod show pod guest

559
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Stick it in your ear
