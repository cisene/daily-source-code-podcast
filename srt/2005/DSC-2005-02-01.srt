1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Daily source code, 2-1-2000 meters, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get ready for the generation of rockers!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Augustine, it's Adam Curry!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey everybody, welcome to the Daily Source Code.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today is Wednesday, the first of all.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage and the lovely affluent Surrey Suburb of Gilford.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is the Daily Source Code today.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
As Wednesday, it's February 1, 2005.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I guess we're supposed to say, what is it?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Rabbit, rabbit, or bunny bunny?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Something like that.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's supposed to bring you big buck and big bucks.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a little different show today.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I think I mentioned yesterday that I was being interviewed by CNN.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So if you think yesterday was wacky, today is going to be even more interesting.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's about a thousand degrees in the quote studio with all the lights on.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I've got eyes in my back.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So the next 40 minutes I'll bring you a couple of promos, got some pot-safe music.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm also going to talk about, I've got some techno bits to talk about as well.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As usual, I'll show about nothing.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I guess the couple of the, what was it?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The cheap trick record fell off the wall.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Not once at the beginning of the show, but twice at the end of the show.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I got a lot of email from people saying that perhaps the cottage is a bit haunted,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or perhaps it's a message.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Actually, I'm looking at my show notes right now, and of course you can check that out at curry.com.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A message from Bob said, is it possible that maybe this was just cheap trick trying to give you a message that they really want you to play one of their tunes?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Good idea.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want you to want me on your daily source code.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I want you to want me.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
By the way, Michael Butler, but you didn't enjoy this one, buddy.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want you to want me.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I believe you.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I love you, I believe.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I believe you to make me.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I want you to want me.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I believe you to make me.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I love you, to love me.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Shout out for those who used to draw their mission.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They don't hurt them.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You may say that you know me.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want you to want me.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want you to want me.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want you to want me.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I love you, I love you, I love you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:30,000
, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you. you, you, you, you,

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Teamtime

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to be with you

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll be with you

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I know you will be with me

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll be with you

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To beg me

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I want you to want me

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I want you to want me

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want you to want me

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was a good thing seeing an end to you

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How else would I have known that there is no Wednesday February first

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course it's Tuesday

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And were you sitting there in the car during that song saying

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I want you to want me to keep track on a daily source code for Tuesday February first 2005

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That of course played because yesterday the platinum cheap trick record that I gave me in the

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I guess was it early nineties

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What is that?

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let me see what the date is on that

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't even see it because the cassette is on

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Remember the cassette shifted in when it fell

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't tell

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What has it been?

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I do know that Patricia and I went to the Montro

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It was at the time was the Montro Rock Festival

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Which was held right around the time of the Montro Jazz Festival

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In Switzerland

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And at that I see me see it was Robert Palmer was there

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think I've told you the Robert Palmer story

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But I don't know if I've told you the cheap trick story

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Because Rob and Zander who he celebrated a birthday

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Just recently I heard on the rock and roll geek show

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Michael Butler said he turned like

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He was in the 50s now Rob and Zander from cheap trick

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think he must be close to it

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He was hitting on my wife like no one else is business

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
At the casino until I walked in

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of course and give him a piece of my mind

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey Adam this is Chris Chapman

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'd like to respond to your podcast from January 28

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay Chris

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The Friday edition the 28

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're as bad as dates with I am Chris

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You were speaking very early on in the show about

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The glitches and recordings that the dropping on the sound

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Alright this is where I did the sound seeing tour of

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think it was the sound seeing tour of

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Guildford or was it the MTV Chronicles that I did with Ken

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Where we had some dropouts in the audio

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And what had you?

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I thought I'd pass along a few tips of how to

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Avoid that

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
First of all

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's a really good idea to record on a secondary

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hard disk other than your boot drive

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Especially truly in Mac OS 10

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not sure about the Windows environment so much

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The problem with that Chris is that

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then I've got to be slipping along

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Firewire drives and stuff

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And even if you're talking about a secondary hard drive

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Even with Firewire I think it's still going to be

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's going to be some latency

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've done all this stuff with Final Cut Pro

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And other big media programs

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And eventually these hard drives get sick

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I don't think our computers were made to do this

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
To actually play back audio files

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And record them at the same time

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's what it seems like to me

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What that allows you to do

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It is right and a free stream

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's unencumbered by the system

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Trying to maintain itself right

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's log files and process system events

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Especially if you're doing audio hijack

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Or you're saving mail or you're doing Skype calls

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think the problem was just that I was

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Playing back a huge file

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Must have been 600 megabytes because it was an AIFF

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then recording to AIFF

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think that's for the problem came in

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But maybe we'll try that

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We'll try recording on an external drive

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Next time I do a soundseeing tour

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If it doesn't work, then I'll just revert back to the old system

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well Adam, the truth is out

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Grant Piccolo and dumb price

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Are the creators of PWFenton

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PWFenton is a fictional character

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Who in their strange twisted world

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
produces the podcast Digital Flatsom

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I hope you're satisfied

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So this is the big Doctor Floyd versus PWFenton controversy

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So now we're all straight now

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Actually our team suffrage

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Holded the microphone

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Did you hear that?

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's just listen to the CNN guys

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah, well did you say that cheap trick was playing at a gay club

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What club is that?

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A story

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
A story?

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Where?

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
In the top and top road

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When are they playing?

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh five years ago

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, I was like, wow I got to go see

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm going to go beat Rob and Zander up

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm going to hit on my wife again

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Something that we've been doing for the past couple

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually about a week and a half here on the daily source code

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is the the trivia of the day

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Which some are calling the stump the stupid podcaster

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Others, I mean there's a lot of production

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's going to this of course

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I think it was our body

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
From the Netherlands who started that off

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yon Polet

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He started that off

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a really high production value

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Which I liked a lot

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have yet another trivia

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
MP3 that was sent to me today

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let me see if I can

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who did suicide this to me

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Probably mentioned it in the opening

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Listen

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hi Adam

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have four short clips with distinctive intros

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
From the 60s and 70s

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All right

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Four short clips distinctive intros from the 60s and 70s

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I should be able to do this

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sure you'll get these

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, okay

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Answer's at the end

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Answer's at the end

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
All right, hit me baby

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh

195
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay, you got me

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know the first one

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know what that is

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I bowed

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, one down

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's the next one?

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Sam and Dave hold on

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm coming

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or as we like to say here

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Tony and Guy

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That was easy

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Next one

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Third one in the list

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's actually

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Isn't that 80s?

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That still qualifies the 70s

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm lying on richy head then

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000

I know the answer

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh

I suck

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey Adam

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's KCT of KCTs digital world.com

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I'm sending you a

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Link to my commute cast

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I sent you an email

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The other day on the commute cast

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
As a concept

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've cleaned it up a little bit

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
To make it a little bit better

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And I hope you give it a listen

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
My goal is to

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Once a week

273
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Do a cast in my commute

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And take questions

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And be a audio feed that I can learn to

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
C.D. and play during the commute

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And hey

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well I'll come meet together

279
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And C.D.

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We'll see what happens

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Give it a shot

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And tell me what you think

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thanks

KCTs digital world.com

287
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The commute cast

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Definitely subscribe to that

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Also thank you very much for all the

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The pointers to the sound

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Seeing tours that I keep updating the feed

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
With

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
SoundSayingTours.com

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What was I going to say?

295
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh yeah

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Remember yesterday we did the wake cast

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I just got a Skype message

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
From Ron Bloom

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let me see

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Said

302
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hi Adam

303
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I heard the wake cast

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This was due to the death of his father

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
90 years old

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So more celebration of life than anything

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So Ron Skype me said

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hear the wake cast

309
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We'll be playing for those

310
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sober enough to make it to breakfast

311
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's morning

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Thanks so much for all the kind

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wishes.

314
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The funeral was beautiful

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And many kind words said

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And much good humor

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There were 50 to 75

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Attending which was a surprise

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
In my eulogy

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I thanked them and told them about

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The good wishes for dad

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
From around the world

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It was a theory moment

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So that is of course

325
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Coming from

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Even from podcast

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And then a second message from Ron

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think this is great

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It said thanks again to all the

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Daily source code listeners

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
For the kind wishes and good vibes

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
As for the show

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I was told by the rabbi

334
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The Jewish tradition has it

335
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Upon reaching heaven

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Everyone is given a white

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
iPod

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Stay tuned for the heaven cast

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's something

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Belonged under our godcast

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Quarter category

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't you think

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Continuing with the

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You don't own me vibe

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We've been on for the past week and a half

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And start off with the

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000

With their cover

349
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You don't own me

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We've gone through

351
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The original Leslie Gore

352
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We've had Rasputina

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All of these of course

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Except for Leslie Gore

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And today

356
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And this actually was suggested by

357
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Number of people

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Through email again

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
All of this on the show notes

360
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's curry dot com

361
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or daily source code dot com

362
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This comes from Greg

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And Boston says

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Love Rasputina

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Maybe you'd like to

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Regale your audience

367
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
With yet another cover

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
For your consideration

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Clouse Nomi

372
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's from his uncore album

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's from 1983

374
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And it's different

375
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's for sure

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Check this out

377
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's kind of like a

378
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Rock opera

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Depressed version

380
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's like you want to grab the

381
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Toaster and jump into the bathtub

382
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Along with a Leonard Cohen wreck

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You don't own me

384
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You don't know me

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm not just a

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Not your little toy

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You don't own me

388
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Don't say I can't claim it

389
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But

390
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You don't own me

391
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm just a

392
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm just a

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Love Rasputina

394
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And Boston say

395
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't say I can't claim it

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You don't own me

398
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You don't own me

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't try me down, all I need is to take

400
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And go and tell me what to say

401
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't try, what to do

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Just imagine me being myself

403
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's all I have for you

404
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know, then I'll be next to you

405
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I'll be next to you

406
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
To give my life the way I want

407
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Take care of the two

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Whatever life will be

409
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And I'll be next to you

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You don't know me

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not just one of your little toys

412
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You don't know me

413
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Don't say I can't play with other boys

414
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I'll tell you what to say

415
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I'll be next to you

416
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And I'll be next to you

417
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And I'll be next to you

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
To give my life the way I want

419
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
To give my life the way I want

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
To give my life the way I want

421
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:46,000
To give my life the way I want

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay, be honest, did you skip forward through it

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Or did you like it?

424
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Definitely different, that's for sure

425
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You know, I actually have a bruise on my knee

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
From hitting the Louis XIV

427
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I turned around

428
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We did this new set up

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Patricia and I cleaned up the whole office studio

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's working okay

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But the desk and the chair, the combination

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
For some reason just doesn't

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Maybe I need a different

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I could actually do with a mic stand

435
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Maybe that's what I need

436
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Not just the one that sits on the desk

437
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But one that comes around from the side

438
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Something like the professionals use

439
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Her great montage

440
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Last night I was in the bathtub

441
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Pulled the iPod in

442
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Not into the tub but close enough

443
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I was listening to

444
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The title of the podcast caught my eye

445
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Used radios symphonic magic

446
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I just decided to play this

447
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So haven't queued it up

448
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Let me just see if I can find this

449
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
My pussy out

450
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh please, magic

451
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You're horrible as usual

452
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay, here it comes

453
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's just go back a little bit

454
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay

455
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay

456
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is the best thing on the internet

457
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It is a deep sense

458
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Adam Curry

459
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, yeah

460
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

461
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Gosh, you're so asleep

462
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I wasn't going to sleep

463
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What?

464
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm not in a haze

465
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm not in a haze

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The affluent neighborhood of the

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Sorry, yes

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Engel it

469
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, Gilford

470
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The money

471
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The next door to Madonna

472
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And the downtown Julie Brown

473
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Listen

474
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It is absolutely impossible

475
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That I can live next door to Madonna

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And downtown Julie Brown

477
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay

478
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Just does not exist

479
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay

480
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Alright, this is it

481
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is so amazing

482
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And whoever did this

483
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I didn't see your email or anything

484
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So whoever did this

485
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It gets a free Madge Weinstein DVD

486
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You just have to email me

487
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because this is a wonderful

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh my god

489
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Too much build up

490
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You'll probably hate it

491
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But I love it

492
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hello everyone

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Madge Weinstein here

494
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know if you can hear that

495
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Wonderful sound

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
In the background

497
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But that is the sound

498
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
As a California pizza kitchen

499
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Pizza being ready

500
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
To stop for Madge Weinstein's highhold

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And when I talk in the morning

502
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh we can't

503
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, you know how easy it is

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Being me it's not

505
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You know

506
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's not easy to be a mental patient

507
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll tell you why

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Because what happens is

509
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The slightest thing goes wrong

510
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And you get an anxiety

511
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
An anxiety is worse than depression

512
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But I have both

513
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
An anxiety is this all-consuming

514
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Sort of psychosis

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's just sort of below the surface

516
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
All the time

517
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You never know what is going to come

518
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And take over your consciousness

519
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So Madge had a go

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I told her I would finish for her

521
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Um

522
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
She wanted me to tell you

523
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That um

524
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
She'll be back very soon

525
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But she was having um

526
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What did she call it

527
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Spirish who will difficulties

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She was feeling fact

529
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's really the bottom line

530
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I know what to close with

531
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know you can tell me a lot of things

532
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can call me a country you can call me a lawyer

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You can tell me to go fuck myself

534
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You can tell me I'm in sensitive to breast cancer

535
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Because I think yeast is worse or whatever

536
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But don't tell me I don't exist

537
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Sure

538
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Sure

539
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Sure

540
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What ever married

541
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In a beautiful

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh my that was so lovely

543
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I love

544
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Um

545
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So if you haven't checked it out yet

546
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's a podcast you uh

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's not safe for work I'll point that out right at the beginning

548
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But it's something you do not want to miss

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is Madge Weinstein at her best

550
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
yeastradio.com

551
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a great podcast

552
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And especially if um

553
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If you're in a technology as well

554
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Manch has has a down

555
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You know knows a lot about the McIntosh

556
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Wants a Mac

557
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And once someone to buy her a G5

558
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
One with less fan noise

559
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Um

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But it's a great podcast

561

563
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm going to do uh

564
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Actually I'm going to keep it short today

565
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Um

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because I'm tired

567
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000

568
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
