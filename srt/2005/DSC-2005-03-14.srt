1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Transmators, we don't need no stinking transmittance.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Augustine, it's Adam Curry.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, it is the 14th of March.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The power of the Lord.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And pretty much a typical gray English day.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A little bit of sunshine over this morning.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Not enough to classify it as anything really nice.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a start of a new week.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And it feels like that week really started yesterday.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Lots of exciting stuff to talk about.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you may be heard about the new stuff that has been coming out.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm gonna start to talk a bit about what we're doing and see if we can get some of the usual stuff in there.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Special hit test today.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Still haven't found Michael Butler online at a time when I could record that we could do that.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Heavy metal guitar solo hit test.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But I'll keep my eye on Skype.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Before you go to the show, just a little bit earlier.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's seven minutes past twelve.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Normally I don't start until like two or three in the afternoon.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But Patricia has wisely set me up for dentist appointment at 215.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
wisely because she knows that if she doesn't set it up, of course I'll never go.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Alrighty.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's see.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm kind of a slow start today.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Actually.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm just going to the tune there.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'd rather slow start.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Kristina although she got up early this morning.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I just couldn't, I couldn't light a fire under her ass.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Quick enough to get out the door.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So I got stuck in a lot of traffic on the way to school.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She was late and then everything just kind of got delayed a little bit.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
To start things off today, an email from David Harvey.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's from Auckland, New Zealand says.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Listen to the daily source code regularly.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And he wanted me to say hi.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I love this.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a long distance dedication everybody.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Say hi to my friend Jared Rimer who's in California.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I got a lot of actually kind of interesting where you would ask me to say hi to your friend Jared.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know, where on the internet you could send that directly to him.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The radio used to be really handy for stuff like that.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But that's changed somewhat anyway.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
David sent me a really cool mashup that I wanted to play for you.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a green day and well, you'll hear that with the other song.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a title Boulevard of Broken Songs.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to be the day that they've got to throw it back to you.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where the city sleeps and I'm late all the time and I walk alone.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I lie.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You should have somehow realized what it got to do.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I walk alone.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Leave it everybody.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The other words.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to be the day that they've got to throw it back to you.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I want this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sure you've read it all before, but you'll never really hide it out.

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sure you've read it all before, but you'll never really hide it's out.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We're the other, and we're the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world the world's the world's the world' the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world of the world's the world's the world's the world's we're the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's food's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world's the world

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I walked this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams two days

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's gonna be the day that they got a Broadway back to you

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I walked this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know you should have somehow realized what you got to do

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When the city sleeps and on the only one

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't make the message

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They won't be watching each other and she'll be watching each other

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's gonna be the day that they got a Broadway back to you

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I walked this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know you should have somehow realized what you got to do

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Wow.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Boulevard of Broken Songs.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Excellent.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Massive.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thanks to David Harvey for sending that in.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I've got some kind of...

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know, some kind of...

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Fucking hell.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My microphone again.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't know what that is.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If I seem to turn up the second mic, then the home goes away, and then you hear the birds more.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So...

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll just leave it at that.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's perfect.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You know, I get a lot of email about these mashups, and I've got to be honest.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Your people always ask me, oh, can you send me this mashup?

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Can you send me that one?

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I mean, first of all, from a technical standpoint, this is going to become a problem pretty soon.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You know, these mashups, it's just not going to be possible to listen to them together.

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And already what I'm doing is, if I get a minute, I trash him right after I'm done.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean, it's...

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's just like a piece of free flowing form art, you know, that I don't...

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't think that you'll go back and listen to a mashup ten years from now and say,

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, you know, I remember exactly what I heard that mashup, you know, because it's probably a...

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a combination of the songs that makes it work.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And I think it's just like a temporary art form, which just flows and, you know, it just...

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It kind of is.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That make any sense?

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Dig it though, especially that one.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have...

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm really building up a treasure trove of stuff that I have yet to play for you.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And as I was...

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I actually had some...

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A lot of time over the weekend to do stuff.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We got out of Triple P podcast, Patricia Pie Podcast, which was a lot of fun.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I hope everyone likes it as much as the first one.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And as much as we enjoy doing it, and it really is quite enjoyable.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And in fact, there's something about kind of being in an interview situation with your spouse that...

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's...

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, it's cool.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now I can understand Dawn and Drew even a little bit better, perhaps.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I have to say, whenever we do a Triple P podcast and so far, you know, batting a hundred there,

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
we always have great sex right after the show.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hi, I'm Michael Gohegan, the host of Real Reviews, films worth watching.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now that Real Reviews is available to you on the DVD, Talk Radio Network.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I wanted to put together short introduction, tell you a little bit about Real Reviews and what you can expect from the show.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Real Reviews was the first movie review, commentary and discussion show available on the internet via podcast.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And we've been really fortunate to have become one of the top rated podcasts that are available.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We now want to work to bring that same commitment to quality content to you, the listener at DVD, Talk Radio.

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In each podcast, I'll discuss one film that's available on DVD.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Now as the tagline suggests, these are films worth watching.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
However, there's no boring academic talk here.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We'll talk a little bit about how the film was made, maybe some of the historical context behind how it was put together,

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
the people involved, and a basic outline of the story.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
However, I worked very hard to make sure that I don't give away any spoilers.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In some cases, these are films that you've seen before, hopefully I'll encourage you to see them again.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In other cases, they're films that maybe you've never seen, and you'll get the opportunity to watch great film for the first time.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So if you love movies, you should be listening to real reviews, films worth watching.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now available to you on the DVD, Talk Radio Network.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's Michael Gohagan, who's been podcasting since the word was invented with real reviews.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And what I really like about Michael Gohagan is he's an entrepreneur.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He's like, he's always chasing, I guess for lack of a better term, we'd call the American dream.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But he really is, I think he runs a, I can insurance services company or something.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He's successful.

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And he's just really picked this up, and I could, I could, I met him out in San Francisco.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I could really tell that here's a guy who's going to really jump into this and really go head first.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If he sees that there's an opportunity for doing business.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And clearly, there is.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's doing syndicated deals now with the DVD talk with Radio, and it's cool.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm very, very happy to see that.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now, over the weekend, we launched, and we is a Boku communications, B-O-K-U with little funny slashes on top of the O and the U.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We launched podshow.com, and so immediately some questions sprung up.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
First of all, what the hell is this? What's going on? Why does it look like you're selling soap?

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Actually, there's something that Ron Blum and I have been thinking about for many months and working on quite hard.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:39,000
During that, during that time period is really, how can we bring together the three real elements that are necessary to create a marketplace?

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And, and what's been happening on the internet, what's been happening with podcasting is kind of automatically push me in that direction without me.

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I really even even realizing 100% of myself, I think.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see, where should we start? Let's start with making it easier to find podcasts and receive podcasts.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now, there's a lot going on in search. There's a lot of people looking to set up specific podcast searches.

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There's many directories, podcast alley, of course, is a great place to go find top rated content, which is based on voting.

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We need to work on the voting a little bit. I'd much rather have an opportunity to vote more than once a month, but even so,

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
this is where the community goes and tells each other about the cool, excuse me, about the cool podcast.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There's also ipodder.org, and ipodder.org is one of the things that I really want to work on, not necessarily ipodder.org by itself, but the directory.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The directory at ipodder.org now contains, as of this morning, 4,08 podcast that it's tracking actively.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
As you can tell, it's really, it's not much of a site. It's a category listing. You can go into the category and it gives you the XML fee.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It doesn't give a link to the site. It just gives you an XML fee for each of the podcasts.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Now, the whole reason, well, let me start backwards. The reason why that site was just kind of a bunch of RSS or podcast feed links is because it was really built from the bottom up, the bottom being the opml structure.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If you don't know what opml is, please take a look at opml.org. You can see there are all kinds of links to information about it from ipodder.org.

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What's cool about opml is you can create distributed directories.

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I maintain this top level node, or what I call my top level, at ipodder.org, and that's where you see this whole list ranging from agriculture down to wine or women, I think, is the last one on the list.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Literally the way I maintain that, and of course I've built some tools over time, but it's just an outliner.

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You probably see an outliner, maybe you know how to outline from school, and maybe you've used Microsoft Word as an outliner.

193
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I use Frontier, which is like a full version of radio user land, and what's cool about it is, when someone else maintains a node, so for instance, the, let's see, science fiction, node is being maintained by someone else.

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:45,000
All they do is they create their own opml file, their own outline of the links that belong in that category, and they send me a URL to that opml file, which I literally just copy and paste in, and then all of a sudden when you go to the web version, you click on what the link that I've now created, and literally is a link, it's just it's rendering on my server into a new page when you go to science fiction.

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It'll, you know, bring up the nice, you know, the little world icons, and all the links as put in by the person maintaining that directory.

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So what's great about this is you can really build this directory extremely quickly, and the content that's in there is of high quality because it's not an automated decision making process.

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You know, you have to actually, when you want to suggest a link, you do that through the suggest a link feature, and then an email is sent to the category or node editor, and they decide if they're going to put that in.

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And of course, they're also out actively looking for new, new podcasts to be put into their particular node, and a podcast can be in multiple nodes, obviously.

199
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So what's great about that system is that the category editors essentially own their own data.

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's theirs, you know, if they decide to change something, they can change it, I can't stop it.

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If they decide to go away, then they can just stop updating, you know, it's literally that simple or remove the file.

202
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So it's, although I've been providing the central resource, everyone has has their own data built up which belongs to them.

203
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
None of it is stored except maybe for a cash stored on iPod.org.

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So to make it easier through podshow.com, we are creating basically the definitive directory.

205
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is where we want to have all the stuff in there.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You want to have the great search, you want to have the great categorization, you want to have the voting systems, and we've been talking to multiple people about that.

207
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The category editors, and I couldn't have been dropped more hints, you know, throughout the past couple of weeks.

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like, hey, you know, jump on if you want to be a category or node editor.

209
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The way it is, I pired out of org, you know, it's nothing's really going to change there.

210
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We just gave it a little bit of facelift and quite honestly, no one's really happy with the facelift, but it's better than what it was.

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And we've been streamlining some stuff and doing some static rendering on the directory because it gets hit really, really hard.

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's still going to remain the central resource, and we make the output of the entire directory available for anyone to do anything with that they want.

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You know, it's there for you to build applications upon, et cetera.

214
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And that's linked from the XML icon on any of the directory pages.

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So what's cool about this new world of business is that you can only compete on quality and speed the market, I guess.

216
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So every single one of the node editors are going to receive an invitation to participate in a way to actually make money at what they're doing.

217
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because there's many marketing and advertising opportunities when you have such a wonderful resource to use.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And I guess anyone could essentially copy this idea, idea, and do the same thing.

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I mean, it's no, no big secret here, which is what I like about this, you know, again, it's really down to quality and speed to market.

220
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There will be new tools to maintain category nodes with.

221
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There will be ways for you to participate in revenue opportunities or bring some of your own in.

222
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I mean, it's really going to be a complete open forum for everybody to join in.

223
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And that's one of the things that makes me really excited about about this new venture and about the first thing we're doing, which is podshow.com.

224
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Boss, excuse me.

225
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know about this new stance.

226
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If this is going to work, I'm sitting down behind the desk.

227
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And it gives me, gives me gas.

228
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What can I say?

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey Adam, it's Rob from podcast NYC and I just wanted to say you tortured me all those years when you were on Z100.

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But now I'm starting to feel a little nostalgic.

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I'm glad that you're back with your daily source code.

232
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to thank you for that.

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I also want to talk about my podcast at podcast NYC.net.

234
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's actually more than a podcast.

235
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's actually five channels of podcast feeds.

236
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I've got my pop culture rant where I rip and ran on culture in the United States of America.

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I've got Ali Cuts, a new music program where I feature a new band every week.

238
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've got podsafe music where you can download MP3s.

239
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've got my audio book.

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Welcome to the BI.

241
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a business advice book and I'm posting one chapter a week.

242
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And then last but not least, I've got New York Minute.

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The groundbreaking New York City travel program.

244
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So please come to www.podcast NYC.net and add them.

245
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I promise everyone's still going to listen to the daily source code.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
They'll just spend a little bit more time at podcast NYC.

247
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Take it light and I'll see you on the site.

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh yeah, everybody take it light.

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll see you on the site.

250
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, right on.

251
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh boy.

252
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I see where was I?

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Podcasts.

254
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So obviously there is another wise.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We wouldn't have started this.

256
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There is a demand for from podcasters to be able to make money.

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And actually, I'm jumping ahead kind of to advertisers.

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But let's say that even the top podcast, including this one right now,

259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
really don't have enough critical mass to really sustain any type of advertising model.

260
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Certainly not on what we call a CPM, like a cost per thousand.

261
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And the M stands for meal in this case.

262
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So we need a couple of bootstraps to be put into place.

263
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And I guess I will jump over to the advertiser Marker's part.

264
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's the world that Ron and I come from.

265
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And we really did a lot of work talking to many people on Madison Avenue.

266
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Big brands, companies that are all in one way or the other.

267
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They're interested in basically finding their audience.

268
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And they're realizing now much more that the shotgun approach is retracting a bit.

269
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And you know, if you're looking for a particular audience, you can,

270
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, when it comes to podcasting,

271
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you can certainly listen to a number of shows and already just intuitively know what kind of people

272
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
listening to that show.

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But also there's just a lot more information available.

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And there is a much closer loop between listeners of podcasts or audio based programming.

275
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Distributed in this fashion than there is perhaps through traditional radio outlets.

276
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And that audience, as we've discussed before, is moving away.

277
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They're not really listening to the radio anymore.

278
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You know, the iPod and MP3 players is definitely where it's at.

279
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So there's some bootstrapping that's going to be done.

280
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And, you know, the first thing that I really wanted to make sure we did is made an investment in the content.

281
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Because we've already, I can, it's moving so fast.

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It feels like first it was really cool just to have, you know, this concept of audio,

283
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
nugget showing up on your iPod and MP3 player automatically.

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's moved beyond that.

285
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Now people are really into the content.

286
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I mean, I can tell, you know, and it's, and I get just as much email from people who subscribe to the show

287
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and listen to it on a portable player as, as do people just sit there at their desk or at home on the laptop.

288
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And when the new show arrives, they click it and listen to it right there.

289
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I mean, that's really moved much faster than I anticipated.

290
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So we will be making investments in a number of shows and podcasters.

291
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Really to make sure that, you know, that they can build and won't be, you know, stuck in this,

292
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
in this kind of, in irons, if you will, you know, where there's just no wind.

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Because, you know, not quite enough, you know, critical mass to really make any money to even quit half of the day job.

294
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And I'm an impatient motherfucker, you know, I like to move things along.

295
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So we've kind of figured that out and, and how we can, and how we can get a number of people going

296
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
who in turn will be able to turn around and produce new shows with talent that they managed.

297
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So we've got quite an interesting structure and business model set up for all of that.

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We'll be announcing all this as we go along and hope in the next or in this coming week.

299
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We'll actually be able to do a couple of announcements about some of the talent that we've,

300
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
that will be investing in.

301
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Then the, back to the listeners for a second.

302
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I believe that every listener is pretty much a built in broadcaster.

303
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Just be, you know, for yourself to to test or to, you know, muck about.

304
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It may be for your family, your friends.

305
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's more than likely it's not financially motivated at all.

306
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But this is a very, excuse me, a very large group of people who we also intend to help really by making it easy for them to do a podcast.

307
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And it can be with different tools, different interfaces, different means of getting it there as long as it gets there.

308
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And that, by the way, will not all be like a technology thing that we're all building ourselves.

309
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean, there's a lot out there, which is I think the most exciting.

310
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The most exciting part about the moment that we're doing this, the timing 10 years ago.

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I had to go places and explain to marketers and advertisers what the internet was.

312
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And that was, you know, difficult.

313
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And then when we talked about all the great stuff that could do, we actually had to go and build it, which is even worse.

314
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I was actually Dave Winner pointed to a great, a great article.

315
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let me see.

316
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This morning, boy, this is going to take a second here, but I really do want to get to this article.

317
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It was by.

318
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Uh, let me see, was it Glenn Fleischman?

319
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
No.

320
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Wait a minute, no Brian Deer.

321
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's what it was, I think.

322
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, it's titled the long trail.

323
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And down here, somewhere at the bottom, he says.

324
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He, he talks about episode of Star Trek, where Captain Kirk is, you know,

325
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
is, you know, is zapped off the bridge of the enterprise and deposited on a bleak planter of rocks, mountains and precipies.

326
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And he has to fight off the metrons.

327
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And he does that with abundance of natural resources.

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And so this is kind of interesting here.

329
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It says, the notion of available materials has kept with me for years.

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Look around today on the way, you'll find all the tools you need to build whatever you need.

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's what I discovered was the case when thinking about EVDB back in 2002.

332
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
All the building blocks already existed.

333
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Each built somewhere along the long trail of technology just need to be put together in a new way.

334
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Amen to that.

335
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Absolutely.

336
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Uh, so there's a lot of that out there.

337
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And every single day, it's like, you know, I think of something that we can do.

338
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Because basically, you know, there's money to do this with, which is, is the good thing.

339
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And then all of a sudden an email pop up or someone has that idea.

340
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And it's there, you know, it's like, don't have to invent on anything.

341
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's just, it's, it's rocking.

342
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So, uh, stay tuned.

343
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The daily source code will be the main place where I'll tell you what's going on.

344
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And also at podshow.com, that little player that now has, uh,

345
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I should have a copy of that if you hadn't heard that.

346
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Maybe I should play that for you.

347
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's kind of hokey, which was obviously a large part of the intent.

348
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Uh, I want to say, do I have this here?

349
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, I think I have it.

350
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
On my, wow, I can't believe how much I can't believe how much came in from my iPod.

351
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So many podcasts.

352
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's just outrageous.

353
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay, I think this is it.

354
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah, let's have a quick listen to this.

355
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We don't need no stinking trends, man.

356
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000

Here.

377

We had a good time putting that together actually.

378
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Did a little bit of MIDI work to make it all sound just perfect, you know?

379
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This is a great show that came through on openpodcast.org.

380
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I can only play a little bit because like 8 minutes long, but it's an angry IT professional.

381
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's his rant.

382
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Openpodcast.org's number 1310.

383
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
See the flip side of when your computer doesn't work and you call tech support.

384
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There are people behind that, you know?

385
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Hi, angry tech podcast, take one.

386
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, I'm freaking angry today.

387
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Fucking angry.

388
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Just go ahead and say it.

389
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Look, that dead head.

390
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Come into work.

391
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
One of the texts with the biggest business territories of north is gone for the day.

392
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Changes of floater.

393
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Floating day he had off schedule to this day.

394
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Today, Friday, 11th of March.

395
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Why, I don't know.

396
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Reason wasn't made clear to me.

397
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
All I know was all of a sudden with all this other shit I got going on.

398
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I got cover for this time with bitch.

399
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And when feel so bad, if it wasn't such a goddamn habit for a couple of people that I work with.

400
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So it pisses me off.

401
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So, you know, I'm hitting them.

402
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm banging them out one after the other.

403
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Starting early, you know?

404
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I guess it was a 14-point call.

405
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let's go pick a parts first thing this morning.

406
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Get rid of somebody.

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Actually, starting out is very light.

408
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And I didn't know what the hell was going to happen.

409
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But I'd say between nine and 10 o'clock, they just started just pouring in the calls did.

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What the hell?

411
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
What's the do about it, you know?

412
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Take a one at a fucking time.

413
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah, baby.

414
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
One at a fucking time.

415
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You know, if that's not bad enough, the goddamn the way we got the Beijing system set up right now.

416
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When a page comes in for this guy who left, they call me in.

417
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I get one for him and then one for the group.

418
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And if it's some kind of a recall or urgent situation, the people at FWSS want to send out two or three pages for some goddamn reason.

419
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You really should listen to this whole thing.

420
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's just amazing.

421
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You know, all of a sudden it's like it puts a human to the tech support line you call maybe at work.

422
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And those guys don't have it easy.

423
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Let me tell you, they really don't have it easy.

424
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I know because I am one, I'm a tech support guy for my immediate family, my extended family, all my friends.

425
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I'll just say one more time, you know.

426
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's kind of the duty, you know.

427
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If I'm a geek, it's my duty to help you.

428
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And then you'll, it'll become your duty to help someone else once you know how to fix whatever that particular problem is.

429
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But you'll learn that when something goes wrong, it really helps for someone to, you know, just jot down the error message or call you when the error message is still up.

430
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You know, otherwise it's like, you know, it didn't work and something popped up, but it didn't read it.

431
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That just really doesn't cut it, you know, it's not, it's not enough to say that.

432
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, be nice to your friendly technician, your IT technician.

433
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
He really wants to help you. He really does.

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I was, while I was saying that I was trying to pop up a website.

435
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I remember I talked about the, the ingenious idea, which wasn't my idea, but it did come to me through the show.

436
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm going to copy the link here.

437
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, man, I'm doing this through a remote console. It's not very easy. Here we go.

438
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:05,000
To use two dish washers, so that you essentially take the, the clean ones out of one and when, you know, when it's dirty, you put it back into the other.

439
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And you really don't have your dishes and it covered anywhere.

440
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I got a lot of responses.

441
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Basically pointing to the same website, Fisher and Paykel, they actually make a two-draw dishwasher.

442
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And it's built in. It's built into the cabinetry and you have a top-draw and a lower draw.

443
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And I'm saying, yeah, it's totally cool.

444
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Let me see that some of the blurb here, superior ergonomics fully integrated.

445
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Choose your own finished environmentally outstanding.

446
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Not just a dishwasher, but two dish washers in one.

447
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Separately controlled units featured the unique yet delightfully uncomplicated concept of a sliding kitchen drawer, creating superior ergonomics and easier access.

448
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But they haven't really latched on to the idea of, um, I guess that's ergonomics, right?

449
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But they should just say it, you know, never deal with these fucking dishes again.

450
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You know, you keep me the goddamn drawers, top-draw, bottom-draw.

451
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Honey, what draw are we using today, top-draw? I say, I say, that would actually work.

452
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Every beginning has an end, even for this.

453
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Uh, it's a stale-hizer roll.

454
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Stale-hizer bun, or bun, whatever you want to call it.

455
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That's fine.

456
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You'll tell me your heart's straightness.

457
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Everyone, help me find a new good home.

458
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I could do this.

459
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
starring Tim Henson.

460
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's not going to talk.

461
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Friendships will be broken.

462
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The stale-hizer roll.

463
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Someone will die.

464
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Why would you come in here?

465
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Or at least be so lonely, babe.

466
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Instead of a bitch.

467
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Let me tell you that beat out to start a beat I come.

468
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It breaks its 10th from the store-to-view show.

469
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Join us on Monday, March 14th, as we learn together.

470
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He's won the stale-hizer roll from eBay.

471
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Every day on the store-to-view, we talk about crazy, bizarre news stories,

472
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and then proceed to mock him through the kill them.

473
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
For the past several months, I've been astounded.

474
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The amount of crap that's been sold on eBay.

475
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
We're talking grilled cheese sandwiches with the Virgin Mary burned into it.

476
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
A pretzel in the shape of the baby.

477
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Jesus giving the thumbs up.

478
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And, you know, the authors had on a trisket.

479
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That's why for a couple thousand.

480
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's insane.

481
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I wanted to get in on the axel.

482
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I placed a stale-kaiser roll on eBay.

483
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
People have actually been on this stupid thing.

484
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Toon into the store-to-view on Monday to see how it all ends.

485
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
www.distortedview.com.

486
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's 10 minutes of your life. You'll never get back.

487
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Come for the news of the weird.

488
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Stay for the audio pornography.

489
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What?

490
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's just a distorted view show.

491
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And, of course, everything mentioned in today's show

492
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
can be found in the show notes.

493
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000

494
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
or at www.curry.com.

495
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And, even though I don't have a young pull-in hit test for today,

496
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I've got something that sounds close.

497
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Adam Christian, sir, is the Maccast.

498
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Hello, this is the hit test for the Maccast.

499
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
My name is Jan Tualette.

500
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I am the cousin of Jan Tualette.

501
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You might have heard of the Mac, the Adam and Sir.

502
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Adam Curry's.

503
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And, uh, he is today's hit test for especially for the Macintosh.

504
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Okay.

505
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So, here's number one.

506
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
See if you recognize this one.

507
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This is cool.

508
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh, you've recognized his Macmill.

509
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
One more time.

510
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And, here's your 60 seconds.

511
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, I actually had one of these.

512
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That's a Power Mac 61.

513
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I hope you recognize that one.

514
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Here's number two.

515
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
No problem.

516
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh, that's it.

517
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't want to watch.

518
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Hi.

519
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh, this one's familiar.

520
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh, it's quite easy.

521
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
How are we going, sir?

522
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't think we'll see 50 seconds.

523
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Uh, I'm going to guess a, uh, maybe a performer.

524
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We're early performer.

525
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And here's a number three.

526
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The answer is a built-in school.

527
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, that's a G4.

528
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't want to about time.

529
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That sounds kind of familiar.

530
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Um, uh, blue and white, uh, G3.

531
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh.

532
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, how do you know?

533
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I know.

534
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I know.

535
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Did you manage to guess them all?

536
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I, I don't think I quite got them.

537
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

538
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I don't want them.

539
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey, distinctive.

540
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's the Power Macintosh.

541
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
60, 100.

542
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay, see any of that one?

543
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'll run about March 1994.

544
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I hope you got that one.

545
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
He was number two.

546
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Ah, that one is the Macintosh performer.

547
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah.

548
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I see it.

549
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's easy.

550
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I think I can get the model.

551
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh, no.

552
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What about the third one?

553
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Your guest is what I hope is.

554
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He's the eye Mac for me.

555
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Your wife.

556
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
He's your black wife.

557
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
All right.

558
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
My wife does it.

559
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He's your wife.

560
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
No.

561
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Shit.

562
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He's my wife.

563
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You're my wife cause something.

564
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000

565
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this.

567
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000

He says...

571
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You're welcome.

572
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I've been waiting for some time.

573
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000

574
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000

577
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Uh...

578
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Alright, come on.

579
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I gotta tell you, when I have all my subscriptions rolling through all day and I just pop them up on iTunes, it's like the radio station.

580
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
My personal radio station.

581
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And it really, really sounds good. It's just, you guys are nuts, man. I love this stuff. Let's go.

582
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Alright, that's it for the daily source coming from Monday.

Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be keeping you up to speed on the more developments as they come along.

584
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000

585
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
