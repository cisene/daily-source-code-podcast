1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Delta Sierra Charlie two eight eight and hello everybody

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,560
Welcome to the daily source code today is Tuesday and we're gonna do something different today. Oh, Yousa

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been quite a quite a crazy morning actually first

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:26,920
So much to tell but the bottom line is I'm in the curry cruiser and today will be a cruise cast as we check out the brand new

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,440
The brand new car that we got this is the Jaguar known as the pronunciation the Jaguar

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:43,160
XJ Super V8 which means it's the the big sedan or saloon or whatever they call it here and

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,120
It has a supercharged V8 engine so I'm in the driver side right now as you can tell

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,200
Engines off although you shouldn't well you should be able to tell I guess I can already hear my

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Phone interfering

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, let me just oops

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Let me just put that over there. I don't want to turn it off in case someone needs to get a hold of me

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,600
Okay, so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start this puppy up

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,120
All right, instantly the V8 came to life

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,720
I did some

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,200
Oops, oh no, it's non-bod save not good

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,280
I did some preparations for today show and I

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,760
Burned a CD and I'll gladly talk to you about all of that experience so let me pop that in right now

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,480
So we can do something kind of you know halfway official

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,960
Hi, this is PW Finton creator of digital platinum and producer of Adam Curry's Pacho on serious satellite radio

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,320
And I'm mad as hell and I want to quit my day job

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,680
Shit, this is my day job never mind

22
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,400
All right, PW yeah, you know the sad thing is he still wants to quit his day job

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, hold on a second. I'm just getting something out of my coat which I put on the back seat here

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Man, what do I do with my

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Okay, we can't

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,720
Leave

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Unless we have a lighter

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Oh

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,600
My sitting on it. I know I took one with me. Where the hell did it go?

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,440
Ah

31
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,680
Being out got it. Okay, so what I'll do is

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,480
After I'm done recording the show I'll evaluate it and see if

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,360
See if I need to mix the the actual tracks in probably just to give you a good sound you know good effect and

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,280
More over to make it stereo, but I want to demonstrate some of the cool features of this car

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
So let's get the show crank and shall we

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
$16 million worth of airplane straps my ass

37
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,840
Then the next generation radio content in my years

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,760
All right now we're really started with your daily source code for Tuesday

39
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,880
A rolled on the window see if I can let you hear the engine at all

40
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:33,000
We won't go to do that. I forgot this is a CD so I put the CD in and you know you'd hope that the CD player would recognize the the track names

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,840
I thought that that was burned right in when you burned something off of iTunes. No, I just get track three track four

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Let's listen to the engine for a second

43
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:51,320
400 brake horsepower supercharged and this thing is full of amazing fucking gadgets

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,800
So one that we back it up here. That's the door's locking my left hand mirror

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,840
Pointing downwards of course. It's got all the amenities of a Ford we've talked about that and actually I have to say

46
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,320
You know, this is as we say here in the UK a proper motocar

47
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,760
It's built in Britain even though it is owned by Ford which is not a bad thing in fact

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,120
The only two things I can really

49
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,560
Identify that are you know that feel kind of out of place home. I want to bump into my neighbors car here

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,320
Which kind of feel out of place for for British built car and

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Which are clearly Ford influences

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
um

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,280
Is this little

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Green LCD display home on the microphone swaying back and forth this little green LCD display which sits right in my

55
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Spadometer which is the middle dial in front of me

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,080
It's the ugliest fucking thing you've ever seen and so it shows me how many miles driven that's basically your trip computer

57
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,680
But it's also with feedback for the for the navigation this is gonna be I might have to

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,160
I might have to mount this mic differently and I know if this is gonna work for us here

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,200
Because with the swaying I can already hear my voice coming back it for

60
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,920
Okay, so now we're a driving away from the cottage something

61
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,200
Wow, what was that? I would drive or intervene. Oh, I got to tell you about all this stuff

62
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
um

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,720
So we've had the the studio A8 mobile here. Hold on trying to adjust this microphone so doesn't sway too much

64
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,720
We've had the studio A8 and of course we've done a couple of shows from from the A8 which is now gone

65
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,560
And we pretty much in the in the year that we've been here

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,600
We've gotten used to driving on the left-hand side of the road

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,600
But that was in a left-hand drive car and

68
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,640
This is the very first right-hand drive car we've ever had and let me tell you it is some you know

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm it's something different all together. I don't know if this

70
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,360
Swing microphone is gonna work for us. It's kind of a weird sensation

71
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,880
Because I'm constantly drifting over too far to the left of course

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,640
All on we have a yellow yellow green here

73
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,680
And it's it's scary because you really have this sway microphone is not gonna work out a lot

74
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,840
Let me let me do this differently here. I'll just I guess I'll just clip it to my uh

75
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,160
I'll just clip it to me. Okay. All right

76
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,320
Man that doesn't sound as good and I does it. Well, I'll just crank that up and we'll see kind of crank it up here

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,080
Oh crank it up here. Hold on

78
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Okay, already doing things I shouldn't be doing in a brand new car with a right-hand drive. There we go. That's a little bit better

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,480
Okay, so I'm constantly drifting over to the left

80
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm a danger on the road. I'm a menace to society at this point actually

81
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,320
Wow this car is telling me all kinds of things

82
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,080
So it has a a center console

83
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,760
First of all there's some I mean there's some basic cool shit in this car

84
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,240
I see warmers very important for me. I love having a heated ass and heated backside and

85
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,720
The minute you turn that on the cherry wood steering wheel immediately starts to warm up

86
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Which is just the most luxurious feeling for all I gotta tell you

87
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,520
You basically manage everything through a center touch screen console

88
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,840
Which has

89
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,680
Advantage and disadvantages but there's some other really cool shit that they've put on board this machine

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Let me give you an example

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Climate temperature 21 degrees

92
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,560
Right so it just set it to 21 degrees to make it nice and toasty warm in the in the studio

93
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,280
I mean while I'm just driving off towards what I know is a very windy country road

94
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,640
Because it's nothing better than driving a new car on a nice sunny day, which it is today. It's beautiful in Surrey

95
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,120
And having some great driving around music, you know, just to kick back and hit the accelerator and

96
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
And enjoy the tunes

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,280
So while I get out to a piece of open road where I can demonstrate some of the cool things this car has let's

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,280
roll out some

99
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
tunes

100
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,320
This is uh, well of course you've probably heard this several times on the daily source code

101
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
By now you should know Matthew evil, right?

102
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Now there's control so sharp it'll make you bleed

103
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:56,200
We don't talk with just punts of clock can't find each other in the same old grid that maybe a little escape what we need

104
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,960
We love and you work like a dog every morning

105
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,080
The city's paying like the loud taste stain on your dress

106
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,560
Get in the bay and before you break down

107
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,360
And don't cost the down to leave this town

108
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,800
You're on the road because we got to get out of this mess

109
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,000
So let's drive away

110
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Let the sunlight chase us all day

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,840
Not gonna stay in the way

112
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,480
Let's drive away

113
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
It's a good way.

114
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Oh, yeah.

115
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

116
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Those were the song and that took it for granted.

118
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,480
But bumping the road, not really in part of the track.

119
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Come on, come on, it's alright.

120
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
You made me believe tonight.

121
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Love and makes you so damn good to be left.

122
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Oh, so let's drive away.

123
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

124
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Nothing goes in in our way.

125
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Let's drive away.

126
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Sorry, but I see fast, but I gotta be going.

129
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Oh, yeah.

130
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,480
We've gotta be more than the coffee shops in the bar.

131
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Baby, baby, it's still late.

132
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Baby, baby, it's just late.

133
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,480
We need you take my hand and we'll get in the car.

134
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Oh, so let's drive away.

135
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Let the sunlight chase us all day.

136
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Baby, that's all I got to say.

137
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Let's drive away.

138
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
We'll drive away.

139
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Baby, baby, it's still late.

140
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Baby, baby, it's still late.

141
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
I've said it before.

142
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I'll say it again.

143
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Top down, driving around music from Matthew evil.

144
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Drive away on your daily source code for this Tuesday.

145
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Hold on, I'm just going to queue up the next track.

146
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Make sure that we have that ready.

147
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Okay, perfect.

148
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
So here's the thing I want to share with you about this car.

149
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,480
It has, well, they call it adaptive cruise control.

150
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I call it a fucking auto pilot.

151
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,480
By the way, I really hope you're listening to this podcast in the car.

152
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Because there's, I love listening to podcasts while driving or while in.

153
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
And I think not just on the move, but while in a car.

154
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Listening to someone doing a podcast in the car.

155
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
I can't explain why, but there's something about it.

156
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,480
I just, I don't know if there's some kind of connection there.

157
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,480
So that's how actually, one of the reasons I like Pacific Coast,

158
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Hellway so much.

159
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,480
So they call this thing adaptive cruise control.

160
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
So you know what a cruise control is.

161
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,480
It's, oh, actually it's kicking in now, man.

162
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Okay.

163
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,480
A cruise control is probably going to beep at me in a second.

164
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,480
It is essentially when you're driving along,

165
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,480
preferably on the highway.

166
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,480
And you know, you want to keep a constant speed.

167
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,480
Either the speed limit or whatever the flow of traffic is.

168
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
And you set the cruise control.

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
And it will maintain the speed you set it at.

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
And you can, I'm sure most of you know this.

171
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,480
You know, you can nudge it up or down a mile or two with the usually hand-based controls.

172
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,480
And if you hit the certainly the break and in most cases the accelerator.

173
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
And basically anything you do, even a sudden move on most cars,

174
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,480
these days will disengage the cruise control.

175
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,480
So the adaptive cruise control utilizes the same,

176
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I presume the same technology as the sensors that assist you with parking.

177
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,480
And what it does, it sends out, I don't know if it's infrared or what kind of beam it is.

178
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
But it sends out a beam to the car ahead of you.

179
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,480
And then you have a setting which allows you to determine the gap you want between the car ahead of you and yourself.

180
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,480
So right now I'm on a one of those perfect country two lane country roads driving through.

181
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Hold on a second.

182
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Let me take a look at the navigator.

183
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,480
We are on Epsom Road, hold on a second.

184
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Navigation zoom out 10.

185
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Navigation zoom out 10.

186
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Oops, that was a little too much.

187
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Navigation zoom in 5.

188
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Navigation.

189
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Navigation zoom in 5.

190
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Love it when that shit works.

191
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
We're driving towards the leather head.

192
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Obviously the car has voice response.

193
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
You figured that one out right.

194
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,480
So I have the cruise set to 65 miles an hour which would be way too fast for this road.

195
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
But it was portions of it.

196
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
You can certainly drive 65.

197
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,480
And what's happening now, you can hear the car slowing down.

198
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
It's doing that all by itself.

199
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Because the car in front of me was slowing down to make a left hand turn.

200
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,480
So not only does it do the accelerator work for you.

201
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Whoa.

202
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Okay, you don't want to set it when someone's just turned around a corner because it couldn't see a car ahead of me.

203
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
I hope you can hear the engine.

204
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Okay, so now I'm going to hit resume.

205
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,480
So it knows it wants to go 65 but it can't because there's this white station wagon in front of me.

206
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
So now we're doing 30.

207
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
It's even slowing down the car ahead of me slowed down a bit.

208
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
And if I put my foot just touching the side of the brake,

209
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,480
I can actually feel the brake being depressed like an invisible foot.

210
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,480
And let me tell you last night when I tried this feature out.

211
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I was on the same road but it was pitch black.

212
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
There's no street lamps here.

213
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
And it was just amazing.

214
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It's exactly what you want for these dark windy country roads where you have no idea what's

215
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
around the next corner.

216
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,480
You know, and you could even be blinded by lights of an oncoming car.

217
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,480
And now you can kind of just follow the guy in front of you at a safe distance.

218
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
You can set the gap that you want.

219
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
And it's like, all you got to do is steer and just, I can stay awake.

220
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
I love this.

221
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm sure on the highway would be, you know, we should actually take this puppy out.

222
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Well, how much time do I have?

223
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Okay, we should take this puppy out on the highway.

224
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I think that I'd love to see if we can share some of the experience

225
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
of accelerating with this supercharged engine.

226
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
So I've got to find a place to turn around.

227
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
But right now, I'm cruising on a country road.

228
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
I don't have to worry about monitoring my speed.

229
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm safely behind the guy in front of me.

230
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
It's, uh, I love it, man.

231
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
This is awesome.

232
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,480
So while all that's happening, why don't we go over to some feedback?

233
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, it's empty be again.

234
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Maybe we can get back to some feedback from today's show.

235
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Wow.

236
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
I can hardly believe my ears.

237
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Right after Patricia claims you have the perfect cock.

238
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
She brought to me something more than sex.

239
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
And she turned her down.

240
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Turn for having her come in your pod, shut it shut.

241
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
That's right, man.

242
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,480
I care about the show.

243
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Come on.

244
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
What is that?

245
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
What has happened to our girl pod father here?

246
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
I mean, it's great.

247
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
You're dedicated, but honey.

248
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
I think that's a little too dedicated.

249
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
I can't take time to enjoy the wine.

250
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Hey, don't worry, baby.

251
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I tapped that ass later on, all right?

252
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Anyway, it brought to mind that one of your listeners emailed me the other day to say that

253
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,480
he was ordering a copy of our new album because it was so romantic.

254
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
He thought it would put him in the mood with his lady friend.

255
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
So I was thinking maybe I should send Adam a copy of three and he's easy to help

256
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
put him in the mood of Patricia.

257
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,480
So, uh, you know, give me the address and I'll hook it up for you, baby.

258
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
You know what?

259
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
This sounds like an emergency.

260
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
What did I just send you on right now?

261
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
It's a jazzy one.

262
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,480
So I think Patricia and even Christina will I get it.

263
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
It's called a bide.

264
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
It's by low spirals from free and easy.

265
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,480
And if you did get, I could be persuaded to add it to the podcast of music network.

266
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Just for you.

267
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,480
This is lovely, Angie.

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Thank you so much.

269
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Wish your ass was here.

270
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Get in the warm one.

271
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
See you next to me, honey.

272
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
I'm going to call you.

273
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480

What's going on here?

305
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480

I'm going to call you.

314
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Something to me though, when in your sleep, and love my time,

315
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:55,480
to rise again someday, as feels we hold,

316
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,480
and as we can't stand it.

317
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Let's watch our shoes,

318
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,480
leave our golden face,

319
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,480
hey, hey, got to pass away,

320
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,480
I say let it pass away,

321
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:25,480
let it pass away, let it pass away,

322
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,480
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

323
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Let it pass away,

324
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,480
I pray that it pass away,

325
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,500
And if nothing could be my love

326
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm not a passing way

327
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm a passing way

328
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
And if there's no way

329
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,480
I'm not a passing way

330
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
And if there's no passing way

331
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm not a passing way

332
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,160
Love spirals and G.B., thank you so much, Ronnie.

333
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I hope you do add that to the pod save music now,

334
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,160
work that'll be fantastic if other people could play it out.

335
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,320
So I've turned around now and I'm heading back,

336
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,200
as I said, cool feature of this car is that it has a center console

337
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,160
with a touch screen, which you basically manage everything through.

338
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,480
For pilots, by the way, this is a very strange concept

339
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,920
because one thing you don't do in an aircraft

340
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,520
is touch the screens of your instruments.

341
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,160
Because you always have some kind of oily residue

342
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,600
that will transfer onto the screen and then at night

343
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,080
it becomes kind of hard to read, you get smudges and glare.

344
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,800
And it's hard to see what's on the screen

345
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,880
when you're flying that can be pretty critical.

346
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
In this case, it's basically radio station presets

347
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,560
and a couple other things and the map really doesn't really

348
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,040
affect it all that much, but it is kind of weird to touch the screen

349
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,840
because that's not, you know, my instinct says no, don't do that.

350
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,600
The voice response system has blown me away.

351
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,960
I mean, I've had voice response systems

352
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,000
and all kinds of gadgets and gear and phones and you name it.

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
And you know, you go through hours of training

354
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,200
and I got in this car and immediately it worked.

355
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,400
Now, it has a menu-based system

356
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,280
and I'll just run through the top level menu for you.

357
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,920
It'll do that, it'll do that for you.

358
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,840
So you can hear all the things you can control

359
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,920
with just by pressing a button on the steering column.

360
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,760
Help.

361
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Help.

362
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,440
Voice commands are generally given

363
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,080
in the following format, device, function, setting.

364
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,960
For example, radio tune, 99.7 FM.

365
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Or we use a name.

366
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
Yeah, the play track three.

367
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,840
To give a command, press the voice button.

368
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
After the tone is completed, speak naturally.

369
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
In general, to cancel a command, push the voice button again

370
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,400
while the system is listening.

371
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,120
To hear a list of items for which you can then ask for specific commands,

372
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,520
say voice help.

373
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,280
OK, let's try this.

374
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Just skip the verbal feedback for a command, press the voice button.

375
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,160
OK.

376
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Voice help.

377
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,880
Voice help to get help on a specific system,

378
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,400
say one of the following commands.

379
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Radio help.

380
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
Radio memory help.

381
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
CD help.

382
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Change a help.

383
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Phone help.

384
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
Phone memory help.

385
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,200
Climate control help.

386
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Display help.

387
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,240
Navigation help.

388
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,720
Navigation memory help.

389
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,160
Navigation root help.

390
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Voice memory help.

391
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,720
Help completed.

392
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,320
Wow.

393
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,880
OK, let's try this.

394
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,920
CD help.

395
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,080
CD help for any of the common CD functions,

396
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,520
the following commands are available.

397
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
CD play, OK.

398
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
CD play track one.

399
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,360
Valetrack numbers range from one to 99.

400
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,960
OK, let's try that.

401
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,880
CD play track five.

402
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
CD play track five.

403
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,400
Cool.

404
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:40,920
Hit me.

405
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
It's going to work.

406
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,080
Well, that didn't work very well.

407
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
Let's try it again.

408
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,320
CD play track five.

409
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,000
CD play track five.

410
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,920
Thank you, Runder a lot of pressure.

411
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,080
Watch nine competitors battle it out

412
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
to become president of their own record label

413
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
on the biz.

414
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
It's a new kind of reality show.

415
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm demanding only online at awellmusic.com.

416
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,240
Oh, that was it.

417
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,240
OK, cool.

418
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,960
All right.

419
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,320
So that's the voice response system.

420
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,040
That's fucking crazy.

421
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,760
Let me see what should we do next?

422
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm thinking, let me give you a little hold on.

423
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,280
Let me see where we are.

424
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,560
If I can, I'd love to give a little tap on the accelerator

425
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,480
to give you an idea of what this puppy can do.

426
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,360
We got some time.

427
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,320
So let me think.

428
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,800
I don't have anything pretty sad.

429
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:55,160
I think I can just drive off to the motorway, which is highway.

430
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,120
Actually, right now I'm on a parkway, if you believe it.

431
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,200
I didn't know that they had parkways here.

432
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,280
So here's everything that happened this morning

433
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,640
as I had this idea last night, of course.

434
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,960
And I had most of my prepared what I wanted to do,

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,960
and I'd kind of thought out the route and everything.

436
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,800
So first thing that happens is, well, first of all, yesterday,

437
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,640
Patricia came home.

438
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,400
She had a doctor's visit, and they put her on a 24-hour blood

439
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,080
pressure monitoring system, which is funny,

440
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,240
because she had to wear this device to bed, which

441
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,040
looked like a fling stone's version of an iPod.

442
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,920
But hung on her belt, this big ass thing,

443
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
where the battery and a little display,

444
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,960
and then a tube, the ran around her shoulder,

445
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,720
or across her back to her left arm,

446
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,960
where the wrap goes on that inflates,

447
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
and it inflates periodically.

448
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,680
And she had to wear that for literally 24 hours.

449
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,280
So last night in bed, she had to write it.

450
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,840
I was joking the whole time, I was in hunting,

451
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,640
what's planned on the iPod.

452
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,840
And what happens like every 20 minutes,

453
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,600
or it doesn't seem like it's a set time,

454
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,680
but it felt like almost every 20 minutes.

455
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,880
You hear her, and then a little buzz,

456
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
and then the pump would be activated.

457
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,760
So we had that going all night.

458
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,840
And at one point Patricia got up to go to the bathroom.

459
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,560
And she, of course, she forgot that she was wearing this thing.

460
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,000
She pulls like the old bed, and I'm going with it.

461
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
Anyway, so she got up at seven this morning

462
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
to get Christina up and ready.

463
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,360
Usually she comes and gets me about seven, 15,

464
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,960
or something, and she was like, drive Christina to school.

465
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,480
And Christina was not feeling it all well.

466
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,960
I think she's now as this three day or four day cold.

467
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,560
So she was going to stay home.

468
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,920
So of course, that put me behind no matter what,

469
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,080
because I didn't get out of my,

470
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,840
get my ass out of bed until 830.

471
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,760
And then the usual morning ritual,

472
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
and then I got my gear, and I could not find

473
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,640
a simple connecting cable, a three and a half inch plug,

474
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
another three and a half inch plug

475
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,680
for my wireless microphone,

476
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,720
to plug it into the I River.

477
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
And I'm tearing apart everything.

478
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,280
I must have left it at the condo and San Francisco.

479
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,120
I don't know.

480
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,040
I had two of them.

481
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,160
I think it's probably still hooked up

482
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,360
to the M and 50 for some reason.

483
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
It's gonna connect into the I Mac there.

484
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,680
So for some reason, I left it.

485
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Okay, no problem.

486
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,680
So I went off to go to the stores called Commit.

487
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,760
They usually have just about everything you need.

488
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,480
I also need to get some CDs.

489
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,360
You know, I need to get new batteries.

490
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
And I got a new wire, and I was ready to go.

491
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm in the parking lot.

492
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,040
I'm okay.

493
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm gonna start recording right here

494
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,680
in the parking lot in front of this Commit Store.

495
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,040
Forget about it.

496
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
The three and a half inch, a three and a half inch cable,

497
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,840
which is a beautiful one I bought, by the way.

498
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,680
You know, the gold standard, whatever,

499
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,320
with titanium wiring.

500
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,120
It was in one of those packages

501
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,480
that you can't open without a fucking jackhammer.

502
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
What is up with that?

503
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,000
I mean, I understand trying to protect stuff from theft,

504
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,520
but I had to drive home to get pairs, scissors to open it up.

505
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,760
And now here we are.

506
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,000
Finally, everything's all together.

507
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,360
So I'm driving back into almost our hood now.

508
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,480
Driving past our gas station,

509
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,400
which I will be visiting regularly

510
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,720
in this automobile.

511
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm sure, although we really don't drive all that much

512
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,040
at all.

513
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,000
Steering wheel, cherry wood, nice and warm in the hands.

514
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
My back is heated up.

515
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
It's perfect.

516
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,000
It's perfect.

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Perfect for another promo.

518
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I choose a theme for each day,

Give me a found, not all the joy.

525
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Some things will never change.

526
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm still that jealous for it.

527
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I want you to know me.

528
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll leave it now now.

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah, you push me to the limit.

530
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You're watching never get it right.

531
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
See what side doors on mine.

532
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It fits that fun share.

533
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Bring me my gift out brother.

534
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm home.

535
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The listeners get to vote for your favorite songs.

536
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Every day.

537
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Then for Friday's show,

538
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I take all the most food it looks throughout a week.

539
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And play your top 10 favorites.

540
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So, if you want to discover something music,

541
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
or just want your day to go by,

542
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
just that much faster.

543
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Check out the Potsay Music Daily podcast.

544
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Potsay Music Daily.

545
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Potomatic.com.

546
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So, that is the first show I've heard that's on Potomatic.

547
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's pretty cool.

548
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And I really am digging all these pod tape music shows

549
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that are cropping up.

550
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
We've got a couple of top 10 countdowns.

551
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We've got the spotlight.

552
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
The young palette is doing.

553
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I played a piece of that yesterday.

554
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So, look for that coming up soon.

555
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I didn't get the Christmas song stuff up yesterday.

556
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'll have that up sometime today,

557
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and start posting the first songs to thexmus.podshow.com feed.

558
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, that you can subscribe to that,

559
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and fill up your iPod for the Christmas season.

560
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Let me see.

561
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So, now I am getting close to,

562
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
actually, I'm in Burfum,

563
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
which is spelled Bravo Uniform Papa Hotel Alpha Mike.

564
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So, I used to say Burfum,

565
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
but that's before I was a part of the side here.

566
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Okay, going through a roundabout,

567
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
so trippy man driving on the left and sitting on the right,

568
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
but it's kind of, oh, shoot, fuck.

569
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Damn, that's not what I wanted to do.

570
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm driving the wrong way now,

571
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and hold on a second.

572
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Let me turn around.

573
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So, one other thing that I found at the comet store

574
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is, yeah yeah yeah yeah,

575
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
please go away from here.

576
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And it was at the cash register.

577
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This thing called Kid's okay.

578
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And it just caught my eye briefly

579
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
as I was paying for, you know,

580
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
CDs and the cable and the batteries and everything.

581
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,280
One of my hearing here.

582
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,320
Is that okay?

583
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,800
That's a little, oh, a little splatter through from the radio.

584
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,680
This thing called kids okay.

585
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,120
And I think what caught my eye, you know,

586
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,160
you, of course, you see much more than,

587
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,960
than you recognize, I guess.

588
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,040
I, you know, you're the neurons on your eyes

589
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,200
or picking up all the light and, you know,

590
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,160
so you're seeing things,

591
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,280
but only certain things register.

592
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,520
And the word ping was there.

593
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,880
In fact, I think it was more than just the word ping.

594
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,520
I think it was the sentence.

595
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,720
Don't ring your kids, ping them.

596
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,240
I'm like, yeah, I'd love to be able to ping my child.

597
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,320
What the hell does that mean?

598
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,040
It sounds like a perfect, it's the service,

599
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,400
which I signed up for immediately.

600
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,680
I haven't configured it, but I'll be doing that later on today.

601
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,480
So I'll let you know how it goes.

602
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,400
It's a service.

603
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,080
Oh, I suck, I got it.

604
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,240
I'm on it.

605
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,160
I'm going to parking a lot here trying to figure out

606
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,040
a parking place to turn left and what the hell is this?

607
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,240
This is where it gets confusing parking lots,

608
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,680
because sometimes the inner parking lot,

609
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,400
they want you to stay to the right.

610
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,280
It's, it's indicated with arrows,

611
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,800
but it doesn't help the damn foreigners, you know?

612
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,760
Okay, let me see if I can get out now.

613
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,600
So this is the way out.

614
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,440
Yes.

615
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,560
So it's a service that you set up on,

616
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,840
you can do it online, you can guess you can call an operator.

617
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,840
And it works through text messaging, SNS.

618
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,000
And you can set up three different phones.

619
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,880
And then what you do is you send a text message

620
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,840
to a service number, I think it's like 76, 6, 3, 0,

621
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,120
or whatever, they have one of those text numbers.

622
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,120
And within 60 seconds, oh yeah, so you send the message

623
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,600
to the service number, and then you ping,

624
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,960
and then you're, you can set up a name.

625
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,080
So let's say I would do ping Christina.

626
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,840
And then within 60 seconds, it sends you back a map

627
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,760
with the location of that cell phone,

628
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,360
which of course presumably has your child attached to it.

629
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I was like, oh my God, this is so cool.

630
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,600
Is that over-modulating that it is shit?

631
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,880
OK, so incredibly cool.

632
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,920
Now of course, it's not as accurate as, say, a GPS would be

633
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,360
by no means because, and they actually

634
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,720
had this whole disclaimer thing in the very fine print.

635
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,320
They say in general, you're going to find that the distance

636
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,440
will be within 500 meters of the location of the cell phone,

637
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,360
the loss of your child.

638
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,040
But it could be up to two kilometers.

639
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,520
In fact, it could even be as much as seven kilometers

640
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,360
if you're out in open field.

641
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,680
And that, of course, all has to do with the density

642
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,160
of cell phone transmitters and towers.

643
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,360
But forget that, I love this.

644
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,320
I love it.

645
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,000
Now, of course, you can't just set it up for any phone.

646
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,560
You have to have consent, and that's kind of interesting.

647
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,480
You have to have consent of the other phone,

648
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,320
not of the user, but of the other phone,

649
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,880
because, essentially, they have to authorize

650
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,280
this ping service on their mobile by replying

651
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,600
to an incoming text message.

652
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,080
And then, from that point on, if you ping the person who's

653
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,720
cell phone you're pinging won't even know,

654
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,480
as long as they have the phone on, it's pingable.

655
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,200
And what I'm wondering, though, is this math that you get

656
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,840
but I guess you have to have an MMS capable phone,

657
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,800
off to look into that.

658
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,160
I don't know if it probably won't work on the blackberry,

659
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,400
but I still have the MDA, of course.

660
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,960
And I'm wondering if this is something

661
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,080
that will only work in Europe, or if I don't even know

662
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,960
if it'll work outside of the United Kingdom.

663
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,800
And there was also another disclaimer in there saying,

664
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,520
hey, all this information that we get about the locations

665
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,080
of the towers, et cetera, that location-based information,

666
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,360
it's only as good as the cell phone providers

667
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,200
that, as good as the data the cell phone providers

668
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,880
are giving to us.

669
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,120
So there's a lot of disclaimers in there,

670
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,960
but I think the whole concept is just fascinating.

671
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,480
I haven't told Christina about it yet,

672
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,520
but I certainly will.

673
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,320
I wonder what her response is going to be.

674
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,080
So we'll see what her response is.

675
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,840
I mean, I, you know, that I trust her.

676
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,200
And it's just, I was just blown away.

677
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,480
I mean, how comforting is that for a parent?

678
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,080
You know, okay, she's in town, you know.

679
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,840
She hasn't gotten on the train somewhere,

680
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,840
and she hasn't jet it off with some boy in a sports car.

681
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Okay, we are now getting on to the A3.

682
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,000
I think this is the A3, isn't it?

683
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,240
This is still the slip road.

684
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,600
It's actually telling me that, okay,

685
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,920
well, let me emerge into traffic here.

686
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,160
We're doing 60, 65 miles an hour.

687
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,240
Okay, now I'm going to hit the cruise.

688
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,920
The adaptive cruise is on,

689
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
and I've actually set the speed limit to 77.

690
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,080
It's not doing 77.

691
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,800
I'm doing about 64, because it is now keeping me

692
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,960
nicely behind this red car ahead of me.

693
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,680
I mean, the left hand lane, which is the slow lane here,

694
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,000
okay, so I'm going to move over it.

695
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,480
Let's see what happens.

696
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,920
It immediately starts to pick up some speed some steam

697
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,360
because there's no car in front of me.

698
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,520
Well, a car just moved in front and slows down a bit,

699
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,920
and it's completely maintaining the speed

700
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
that I set it to, this is beautiful.

701
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,920
So now I'm doing about 75, and I'm behind a car

702
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,760
who's actually going a little bit faster.

703
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
So I just set up.

704
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm probably at my 77 miles an hour right now.

705
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,920
But I don't have to worry about what's happening

706
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,000
if the guy up front decides

707
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,400
to all of a sudden hit the brakes.

708
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,120
So let me get to a straight piece here,

709
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,680
and then we'll see what this puppy can do.

710
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,080
So this is, yes, about, okay, so now it's on the adaptive

711
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,840
cruise control, slow down just a little bit

712
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,320
to take the other car ahead of me into consideration.

713
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,880
And I want to, yeah, let me give you,

714
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,120
obviously, this is, okay, so now we're doing 70,

715
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,040
and after this next corner, I'm going to floor it

716
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,080
and see if we can, I don't know what you'll hear.

717
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,400
I have no idea how I've done this year.

718
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,120
It's okay, this is nice, here we go, floor it.

719
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:27,120
90, 100, 110, it's just, oh my god, 130.

720
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,280
Oh, okay, I'm going to slow down now.

721
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,600
Shit, that was cool.

722
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Whew.

723
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,800
The spite, what you might think, I'm not a big,

724
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,160
speed-free, okay, let's just chill out for a second,

725
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,040
after that one, okay.

726
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,480
Woo, woo, listen to this.

727
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
You cannot be driving on a highway, freeway, motorway,

728
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,200
or any kind of way without some driving music from the road.

729
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Here she goes, brother, love other than your source car.

730
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Hey, Larry.

Some shot, and it's so good to you.

732
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,880
Whatever happens, don't leave it so soon.

733
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,120
It's so right when it's okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

734
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:59,120
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

735
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:07,200

787
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:11,420
interesting thing we go from the guy

788
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:23,260
see now also not got a woman so I've got like a like a couple living in my car

789
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:32,540
my goodness okay oh by the way thank you all so much those of you that sent in all

790
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:37,740
I think with the way from this guy thank you all so much those of you who said that my sound

791
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:45,980
was completely opposed the past two days actually I think it's probably since I did that

792
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:52,300
slow thing with Patricia I figured out what it was we remember the power went off and then it

793
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:00,940
came back on well what happened is my somehow the the faders on the mixing board weren't responding

794
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,300
so basically I was happening I was sending audio into the compressor for those of you

795
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:12,540
give a shit sending audio into the compressor limiter at the same time also sending audio out

796
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,100
through the regular outputs of the fader so it was kind of like combining the signals and that gave

797
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:24,780
that that whole like weird phasing effects so it you know it was hard to hear it on the headphones

798
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:32,380
but once once I had it then I knew what to fix so I appreciate everyone who does have their

799
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,860
ears on unlike me for helping me out on that one okay so tomorrow we'll be back with the
