00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Daily source code, March 17th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Transmators, we don't need no thinking transmittance.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey everybody, it's Thursday.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,400
How you doing, everybody? I'm Adam Curry coming to you late today.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,000
Much later than normal. It is your daily source code for March 17th.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
It's Thursday, 2005.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Probably going to be a little bit short today since it's already 630

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,600
and dinner will be on the table before you know it, but still a source code.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:47,600
And just before the show, I was working on two technical bits that have been bothering us here at the cottage for the past week or so.

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,600
One is the annoying blip that digital burp that's been taking place just before every single show starts.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I think I've fixed it now. I basically, a lot of people sent an email on how to, on how to work.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
It's working, it's recording.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
On how to set up the auto record feature, which I think is called,

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
the record sink, and hopefully it works.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Now I'm just trying to see if everything else is working here as a core in the plan yet.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Another thing I figured out is the buzz.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
You're not going to believe with the buzz game from the buzz that was in my microphone.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Actually, let's just turn this down, turn down the music.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
No buzz, whatever.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
You're not going to believe this.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,600
The power cord for my power book was actually crossing over on the floor was crossing over the microphone cable.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Wala, your culprit.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Just got a love figure in that kind of stuff out.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Hey, by the way, happy St. Patty's Day, everybody.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
It is today, right? St. Patrick's Day.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
A couple people said, hey, you should mention that.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
I don't have anything really teed up or I don't.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Geez, I'm not even, am I even wearing any green?

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh, no. What have you do? Don't pinch me, please.

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I think drinking is very bad.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Check this out.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Yo, I got a fake, I need no.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
You're going to love this, the mashup of the day.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Get tipsy over, it's the title.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I'll get a start.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1.

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Homeboy, it should be here.

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
We need to kind of pop it and we'll do this for fun.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
You ain't got one to get you a better one.

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
We sound too dreadful.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
You want a try?

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Oh, your bones are both hard.

43
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Everything's a stress.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
And what's more?

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Well, it's awesome.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
It's fun.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
It's fun.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
It's fun.

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
It's fun.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
It's fun.

51
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
It's fun.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
It's fun.

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
It's fun.

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,600
This is great.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
It comes before to give out to this day.

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Stop dreaming, that's the sandwich.

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
Just a single man ain't trying to get rich

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Little wasted on me, man, son of a bitch

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Nah, he on his side, man, son of a bitch

92
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,660
home just a little more power there for some reason I've been really busy today it's been

93
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,380
unbelievable and of course a lot of that is email if you sent me email you haven't

94
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,660
gotten reply once again someone overloaded on the communications front just

95
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,420
trying to fish all the important ones out of there because I'm really in the stage

96
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,180
of a company that I really like is when we're doing the contracts and putting everything

97
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,380
together and we have a number of contracts were completed yesterday and today which

98
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,020
means things are starting to take shape you know and I really do enjoy that and

99
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,820
so it's been a lot of emailing but certainly a lot of Skype call and I just

100
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,020
got to give Skype it's props one more time and these guys are the phone

101
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,660
companies unbelievable I have my own with Skype it seems like I have my own PBX now

102
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:59,020
you know I can I do conference calls add phone lines you know drop phone lines

103
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:05,220
you know be on one call and then hop off and put a whole conference on hold and

104
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,180
jump on another it's just great really it's great I even have this I bought a

105
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,460
Skype in number which now you can call me in Connecticut 203 unfortunately though

106
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,660
that doesn't work with the Mac version of Skype yet it does work on Windows

107
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,500
and I tried it out and it's very cool it actually just works you know so again

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,740
I think these guys have done it they've become pretty much the phone company so

130
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,820
community so if you haven't tried it yet going over and download the iPodder lemon

131
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,500
something else coming up is the skinny awards if you've not heard of them of this podcast the

132
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:05,260
skinny on sports we say T.S.O.S. it's Andy and Matt skin they're from up there away on the

133
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,020
left up a bit they do the faster 10 minutes on your iPod which is great this is a sports pod

134
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,820
cast I just love because it's tailored for me the guy who knows nothing about sports but wants to be

135
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,180
able to make conversation at the next cocktail party and it's not just news right it's Andy

136
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,780
Matt and they actually sit there and they discuss what's going on in sports and they're doing

137
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,660
an award show and I'm one of the presenters so that is on the horizon you can look out for

138
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,100
them not quite sure when the awards will air because they were still affirming up their presenters

139
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,660
list sounds just like the MTV awards but look for that skinny on sports you can find them in the

140
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:50,700
iPodder.org directory and some great news today I've been doing some experimentation with

141
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,220
as an Amazon associate we've talked about this where I put the Senseo coffee machine up

142
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:03,900
and then she currently have the iRiver IFP 799 running and now a couple days ago when I got

143
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:11,420
the new compact for the sound was it sound sound craft mixing board it was available as well through

144
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,580
the associate program I put that up dude I sold five mixers five mixers my earnings have tripled

145
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,100
in the past you know three days it's unbelievable this shit really works it's great you know and

146
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,540
and I presume people are listening to this show partially for podcast information stuff that's

147
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:36,140
going on and you know so there's a lot you know what's next microphone cable I have to admit I kind

148
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,420
of like selling coffee machines more than than mixers at least audio mixers but maybe there's more

149
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,660
it's great to see that this system works I can actually and by the way so you know I'm not

150
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,420
getting paid by anyone to endorse any product whatsoever or any service on the daily source code

151
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,780
except of course if you look at from a different vantage point I figure that people out there

152
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,580
who want to know what kind of year I'm using and have an opportunity to kick some back to the

153
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,380
person presenting them with that information it's working the the loop is closed it's freaking

154
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,060
work and I love it it really does it's cool I'm very excited about that and here's something that

155
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,380
has been brewing around for a while very early on when we started before the word podcasting was

156
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:30,380
invented and we were dealing with MP3s and automatically transferring them to ii pod actually this

157
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,820
this is a legacy issue from the ipod which later was moved to MP3 players have similar issues

158
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,540
and it's about the ii3 tags and I just want to see if I can bring up this email here

159
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:51,660
it's from bk I should summarize some of this although I put the whole email in the show notes

160
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,140
but I got to tell a little bit of the history about the naming convention of podcast so

161
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:07,660
when I get to complain the dsc-25-03-17 means very little to me and please could you put in

162
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:15,020
daily source code podcast for 314-2005 let me explain why we're not doing that the reason why

163
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,380
is that initially on the iPods and it's still that way on the iPods what you put in the title

164
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:28,700
field right we'll scroll but if you're in your iPod itself and you go to a playlist for

165
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,660
instance you could go to the daily source code playlist or maybe just you know your most recent podcast

166
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,100
it'll only say you'll only be able to read daily source code and it because it just cuts it off

167
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,940
you know it's basically a poor designer a bug whatever we want to call it in in the in the iPod so

168
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,300
if I if you have a long show name title it just won't be able to give you any data so we've

169
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,140
also tried you know doing the dates first and then the show name after that but the same problem

170
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,020
occurs because once you've done the date it basically will give you two or three characters and it's over

171
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:09,340
as to why we put the information about the about the podcast in the album it's for the same

172
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:15,660
in the album field on the id3 tags it's for the same reason if you put whatever's in the show

173
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,100
in the comment field of the id3 tags it won't show up in your MP3 player the only two things

174
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:28,140
that show up consistently across the board and iPods and MP3 players are the title and the album and

175
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,100
those two are basically what you want to see scrolling across the screen so that you could figure

176
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,380
out you know what you're listening to and this just no other way around it I mean the the whole

177
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,540
basically the id3 tags are our bogus for podcasting anyway podcast is not a valid

178
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:52,300
genre type at least in the id3 version two or whatever I'm a little confused and fuzzy on that

179
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,340
it will let me write them in the program that I use but it says hey that's not valid

180
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,780
which is interesting and it's all based upon music it was never intended for podcast so again

181
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,660
those are the reasons that we really did a lot of work and flesh this out early early on so I think

182
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,900
we've pretty much been through that loop and I don't see any reason currently to change those you

183
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,780
know BK is asking for some best practices he actually posted this on his on the site I'll put a link

184
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:25,740
to that as well but that's the reason why it's all about okay how how am I able to find out which

185
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,740
show I'm listening to by looking at a list doesn't work in certainly not in the iPod I river by

186
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,140
the way it's a much better job if you look at a listing of of files or podcasts essentially

187
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:44,140
it will start to scroll and you can even yeah man I river so cool you can modify the the speed

188
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,460
of the scroll and all that stuff but it was really done with iPods in mind so of course it's

189
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,020
it's to look for discussion but by the way I've seen some other very interesting uses of the id3

190
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,780
tag certainly of the album tag being used for commercials don and drew I think had MSMobile

191
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,580
calm in the album ID3 tag and it would just scroll across which it's kind of like RDS on the radio

192
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,260
so what it does fuck up and I completely agree with that it screws up sorry pardon my friend it's

193
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:18,140
screws up management in iTunes or however you're managing your podcast because you know yeah I'd

194
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,980
like the album to be it would make sense for the album to be daily source code that will be the

195
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,020
collection but you know it's we're kind of just cludging it into what's what's available maybe it's

196
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:36,780
time for ID4 tags or IDP tags I just don't know how that works but the industry standard is ID3 and

197
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,700
we're just kind of you know plugging along and using what we can at this at this point in time

198
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,740
so I promised you it was going to be relatively short and what's interesting to me

199
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:55,420
is I'm just looking at the eye river here it appears oh my god so I set up this sink right

200
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,340
the synchronization so it starts when basically it waits for sound and the once it hears the sound

201
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:07,420
it starts recording looks to me like when I shut up for a second and I don't produce any sound it

202
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,700
actually stops recording dude that's a configuration I have to look at and then it starts a new

203
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,700
recording when it hears something so this can be pretty interesting the way this is split let's test it

204
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,700
right now I'm going to be quiet and let's see if it shuts off yep yep one two one two one

205
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:31,740
totally shut off oh my god so I don't know if I can reset that somehow that's going to be very interesting

206
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,340
so now I also don't know how long I've been wait there's a oh man this eye river is they thought

207
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,460
about everything so it looks like I've been going for 12 minutes and 53 seconds of that possible

208
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,620
in total so it does keep a total of everything but it will quit midstream if you don't

209
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,020
provide it with any audio interesting so I'm going to have to work on that well hold on a second

210
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,140
then let's make sure that we provide some audio hold on so now I've got to keep talking because

211
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,820
I'm afraid it's going to like shut off don't want that to happen okay try this audio on

212
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:15,100
okay it's time once it's time for it to look with your on pull it hey on hi Adam this is

214
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:31,740

215
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:53,500

224
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:11,420
hit test for today well it's uh the same thing every time you can send feedback to hittest at

225
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,220
gmail.com and you can find information about the hittest and the separate hittest podcast

226
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:23,340
at young polettes dot-to-n-l that's j-a-n-f-o-l-e-t-t-n-l well Adam see you next time

227
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,700
for our next edition of the hittest thank you bye bye also I was talking to Andrew Brummit

228
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,660
he's the iPod 11 team today and he said that he had put the answers to hit test

229
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,860
was it 22 I think with the hairband the metalband guitar solos he put a spoiler out

230
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,660
he put all the answers up online and hopefully Michael Butler won't see it maybe this week

231
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,260
and we'll be the day that Mike and I finally hook up on on doing that uh doing that hittest

232
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,380
hey listen I gotta go it's uh because now of course I have to you know sew up all these files together

233
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,940
and make sure that it becomes one happy show and god knows it may sound like crap so my

234
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,740
apologies if that's what happened in the long run but I don't really want to re-record this show

235
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:12,620
that would kind of make no sense um tomorrow as I told you I'm slated for two interviews in

236
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,740
London one four uh as a very serious Dutch new show called to be from that which means two today

237
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,980
number that it's on channel too obviously uh so then you know the the Netherlands is trying

238
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,380
is basically catching up with podcast things it's kind of interesting how the press there has

239
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,700
have taken so long to to to really catch on and and really to print anything about it

240
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:42,940
Polo said dinner okay thank you be right there uh see perfect timing uh and part of that is

241
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,940
because the news was really focused on a lot of other really serious issues that are taking place

242
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,860
in the Netherlands um the murder of taeofonhoch uh the Dutch filmmaker uh there's been all kinds of

243
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:03,260
real real big tension going on um death threats to many politicians it's just it's not been a very

244
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,140
happy happy vibe and so I think the news is kind of dominated by that interesting though how

245
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,460
so much of the podcasting uh movement has come out of the Netherlands you know or actually um

246
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,660
I did my stuff in in Belgium but let's just call it actually I did do some of the some of my

247
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,220
attempts at coding the first iPod or script during my radio show and he'll were so more after

248
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,380
the show actually would do that and we're sitting around kind of decompressing and trying to write

249
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,460
two or three lines of code because they had a really nice fat pipe there at the studio and we

250
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,780
good to suck in megabytes of podcasts while I was testing uh sucking in RSS feeds but also look at

251
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,460
the you know there's uh the uh two people from the from the lemon team are uh are in Holland

252
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:54,220
what's Ed's uh mimic is another fine uh uh Dutch product I think Doppler as well I mean dude

253
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,260
this is there's a lot going on it's all in their enterprises backyard it's uh very typical I guess

254
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,060
oh one other thing that if you live in the UK and you've been reading the newspapers the big

255
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:09,020
governmental budget was presented uh it was in all the papers today and one thing that I keep reading

256
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:16,780
is that the UK government wants to go Dutch on uh rules for business uh let me just uh talk about

257
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:23,820
that for one second what they're referring to is the Dutch government's pledge to reduce um all the

258
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:31,980
laws and rules and often conflicting um processes that have to that are putting place for businesses

259
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,740
now I've started several businesses in the Netherlands um very few with big success and let me

260
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,700
tell you the number one problem is you just can't fucking do business there it is impossible there's

261
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,500
been no change whatsoever in any of these rules I recommend that you don't eat the horseshit

262
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,100
that it's working over there or that it's a great idea it's just bullshit to keep people believing

263
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,540
in the government these guys are going to be out when these rules are supposedly supposed to be

264
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,460
in full swing they'll all be out of they'll be in you know in great cushy little uh board director

265
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,420
jobs uh all over uh the world and they won't have to bother with any of that shit but that nothing

266
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:16,620
has trickled down whatsoever it is the worst business environment I have ever been in um and it's

267
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,900
it's it's crazy the minute you you you register a company blue envelope start coming in with you

268
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,500
have to pay this you have to talk to this person uh evaluated tax is separate from uh from normal

269
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:34,140
taxation it's crazy it's a crazy ass country and if you run a big company like diagio and you're

270
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,580
in there get your people out man I'm telling you get them out what do you think we escaped for

271
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,780
hey that's it I gotta go eat as you heard so thank you very much for this short and version

272
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:50,940
