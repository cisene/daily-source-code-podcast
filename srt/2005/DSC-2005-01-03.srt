1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The Lays there began as you reach Web Chapel.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There were tons of hits shut out of your text.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is Ranger's final score last night at 9.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Really?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First on 6.35.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We did it.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's Adam Curry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Adam Curry.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's the first source code of the year.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
How are you doing?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How are you doing?

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's Monday.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well actually it's not.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But with a bit of luck you're hearing this Monday morning.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
January 3rd, 2005.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is the first daily source code of 2005.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm really excited because I'm leaving in the morning.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is actually Sunday night.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if all went according to plan, then I was able to upload the show at the airport.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Within the time window of my team oval membership experience.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Membership expiring, which expires I think Monday.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's the 3 in the afternoon.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I had one week pass for Starbucks.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But I'm traveling towards Ben with my friends.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's waiting there for me in Miami.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can see it now.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
How are you doing?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So packed up the bag.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So right now it's a quarter to eleven.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sunday night.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So it might as well be Monday.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I got my bag packed up because I'm going to be in Miami for a full week.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Patricia helped me out.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And it's just been so busy.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I haven't had time to get my hair cut or really any personal grooming.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It hasn't really been one of those months.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So Patricia cut my hair.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She's really good at it actually.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She does the total package.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She trimmed my hair.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why am I telling you this?

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Anyway, she did my hair.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I love it when Patricia does my hair because it just looks so good.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And what I try to do then is if I go on a trip, I'll say,

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
could you please do my hair and then wash it.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then as I said, she cut it up a little bit.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And she did it just perfectly just the way I love it.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And now I got to be real careful with it because I want to get up tomorrow.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm more after get up at six.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The cab is coming to pick me up at seven.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You know, so if I don't roll around and bend too much, then it'll be good.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And so I said, I'm going to cut the source code for tomorrow.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She said, well, wait a minute.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I just did your hair.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now you're going to, don't tell me you're going to put the headphones on.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I'm like, oh, yeah, that's a real bummer.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I'm doing an ABBA.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Those of you who are, I think, probably at least 30 years old,

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you'll know immediately what I'm talking about.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But remember when I'm afraid in a new year,

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
where a singing was it?

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So dancing queen?

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, there's a studio shot.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So it's not to mess up the hair.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They have the headphones across the forehead.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And actually, I'll add the across the forehead right now.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And now you do it underneath the chin.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's also a very big ABBA move.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So the hair will be beautiful.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Drop, drop, drop, drop...

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This one comes from the NIU Huskies.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ace.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:05:00,560
Oh, that was over much, sorry about that, so that's a great example of asking

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,720
that was shall receive. I was only asking, why just last year, wouldn't it be great if there

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,040
was a drum cadence of the day podcast and boom, there is a showed up on openpodcast.org,

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,400
which is a great service, by the way. You should check that out. It's a great way to, you

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,560
really want to do a full podcast, just want to promote your podcast. That's probably the best,

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,760
it's really what it's really good at. And if you have an idea that you just want to shoot

81
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,520
into an interesting community, or what I hear someone put on openpodcast.org, voice

82
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:41,640
mails that came into his voice mailbox by accident. Sorry, very, very eclectic bunch of files

83
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,640
that come through openpodcast.org, including this drum cadence of the day. And if it really

84
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,880
does show up daily, let's get it, it's own site, it's own podcast feed. I love it. It thinks

85
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,520
the absolutely excellent idea. And so what you can tell, of course, is that I sat outside

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,200
the neighbor's house for, well, pretty much, pretty much every single day, been during

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,120
the weekend. It was great. All of a sudden, there was this Wi-Fi that showed up, just

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,520
boom, just it appeared. I talked about this last week. So instead of going to Starbucks for

89
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
the past couple of days, I just been driving out, like 15 feet into the road, I still have

90
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,560
no idea which house it came from. But that's really not because the easy-and-guys are

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,560
coming in with British telecom this week, while I'm away. Hopefully everything will go

92
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,800
smoothly, Patricia and Christina are briefed. So anyway, I did get a chance to re-acquaint

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,720
myself with openpodcast.org, particularly after I had plugged it on a previous source code

94
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,600
and boom wall, so the stuff just came flying through, not just the drum cadence of

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,640
the day, but look who else came back.

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,000
When the alleged rape victim withdrew, what a civil suit would mean another ring for

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,120
his wife or a few. The tap dancer of the year award goes to Dan Rather, who stuck up

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
for his news when the source proved fake. And his retired money will have plenty of time

99
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,920
to gather, investigations of stories that still employ dangerous break. And you went

100
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,800
up officials at Welding Country's or Stacey Bush that were not at all with step-up

101
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,560
donations for the tsunami at top levels and put out a call to Americans to give

102
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,720
what they can, whether woman or man, or a kid with a plan, will all help put in a

103
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:05,720
need you together again, stay tuned for like breaking up day. That's the 2004 tap dancer

104
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:14,040
of the year. Happy New Year to you too. Good to have the podcast and tap dancer news

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,280
back. I missed it. It was gone or just wasn't showing up or I don't know, but hopefully

106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,080
we'll get a brand new one for 2005 that was the wrap up for 2004 and it came right through

107
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,800
openpodcast.org. And at BloggerCon, was that October and November? That was the beginning

108
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:40,920
of November. Yeah, so it's been two months since BloggerCon. We had one of the thought

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:51,240
dinners and at my table, I sat next to Michael Eman, a very interesting guy. I thought

110
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,720
his hobby. I didn't quite realize how serious he was about his music, although he had

111
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,080
told me quite a lot about the recording of music he'd done. And I know that he's

112
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,160
consultant. He just works all kinds of interesting jobs and does, well, he also does podcast.

113
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,280
And I ran into a couple different projects, a couple different audio files and Michael is

114
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,120
out there and they just popped up in my iPod. It started off with this one. This is Michael

115
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,960
Eman from www.softwareland.org. And there's a new episode of in my life now available at

116
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:39,240
www.inmikeslife.org. Please stop by and check it out, everybody. Like the reverb, Mike. He's

117
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,960
more cowbell. So then, and I actually subscribe, I think I subscribed to this podcast, Mike's

118
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,560
manic minute. This is basically Mike's life on the flip side of the coin.

119
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,680
Stop, you just shouldn't miss. Almost alive, from Mountain View, California, it's 2005, everybody.

120
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,360
And I'll be the first one in it. I was wrong. At least about how fast podcasting would grow.

121
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,160
I predicted two months ago at the water continent. We reached 1000 podcasts by today.

122
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,480
At the iPod or X-Directory now lists over 2,000. But we expect from Microsoft in 2,000,

123
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,200
five. It's blame or I worked for Microsoft, it's a consultant. I was a product developer.

124
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,320
I wonder if he records this all in one go, or if it's edited together and if he speeds it up,

125
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,040
it's great. It's studio 2005, team system 2005, sequel server 2005 and other stuff I can't talk about.

126
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,520
Was that a commercial? Yeah. Speaking of this ruptured change,

127
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,800
Craigslist.org is now being cited as the direct cause of millions of dollars of last revenue

128
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,600
for local newspaper advertising. By the journey Microsoft, I got my last two consulting gigs

129
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,720
via Craigslist and I hired four amazing good people from job posting by found there.

130
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Anyone want to start a video Craigslist to be by podcasting to sell junk in their garage?

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,960
New podcast from the iPod or that extra directory, video game, news radio,

132
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,040
lex tech, paying bare video 2004. They're changing that name today. A TV guide podcast,

133
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,240
godcast network, 10 new feeds, first watch radio, track source, cyberjans radio show,

134
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,920
in over your head radio and rock a boom. And that's your manic minute for January 1, 2005.

135
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah. Oh, man. Beautiful. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. It's perfect.

136
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,320
That's one of the podcasts that I love it. It's great. If I could actually understand,

137
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,240
I'd probably love it even more. So now some might comes out with a song that he did himself call. Good.

138
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,160
It's the podcasting song. And it's actually great. Good.

139
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,240
If I need you sexy, self opponent, I must watch to succeed.

140
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:34,040
You're chosen HDTB on your flat screen LCD and you've been at your brand.

141
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,960
And I feel that we're never so. You've used your commercial thinking.

142
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:52,440
I will sing along. And the perfect life you think I need. But I'd rather be happy.

143
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:02,520
I'd rather feel good. I'd rather hear my casting. The listen to the crap from Hollywood.

144
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,920
If you think it's fantastic, wouldn't mind that shit. Even if I could,

145
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,480
I'd rather be happy. But rather feel good.

146
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,960
The ostrich eating chronic placements, which are a trade box, they're for me.

147
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:33,640
On everything, the breath means to the apples on your trees. To reach my damn and crappy.

148
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,800
You brought my optimal life ham. But where am I stopped in traffic?

149
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,880
When I'd take a bath, you wish I'd see your ego in my sleep.

150
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:58,360
But a drowser behind me, rather feel good. I'd rather hear my casting.

151
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,960
Listen to the crap from Hollywood. You think it's fantastic.

152
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,840
Wouldn't mind that shit. Even if I could, I'd rather be happy.

153
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:25,480
I grew up in the teenage generation. Still I used to think you thought I had a mind.

154
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:35,640
Now it's clear if you just want my attention. You convinced me I'm no good.

155
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:46,360
When I'd show precious brother to life. I'd rather be happy. But rather feel good.

156
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:55,000
But rather hear my casting. Listen to the crap from Hollywood. You think it's fantastic.

157
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,960
Wouldn't mind that shit. Even if I could, rather be happy.

158
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:10,760
I'd rather feel good. I'd rather feel good.

159
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,640
Yeah, come on, that is awesome. It's good. The podcasting song, Michael Leeman on the Daily

160
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,720
Source code. And of course from the show notes, you can pick up the MP3. I suggest that if you

161
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,160
got a podcast and you'd like it, you give it a whirl. It's awesome. Michael, fantastic. I mean,

162
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm actually blown away. We need to get bono to sing it.

163
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,280
Uh-huh. Yeah, that'll happen. What the hell you've been just laughing? Who can't beat?

164
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,680
Oh, sorry about that. Oh, God, that was bad. I'm sorry.

165
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Yeah, I'll leave it to you later. Oh, radio.

166
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,480
Reality, bitch, laughter, radio is on the air. We'll see. See you, jammer.

167
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,040
I got an email from Joseph. Of course, as usual in the production show notes.

168
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,200
Thanks for the podcast. He says, it's actually something pretty weird. I don't know.

169
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,960
He sent me a really nice email. He's been clearly listening to the source code.

170
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,080
He says, I wonder if you would remind the podcast community to be courteous to its supporters.

171
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,520
I've tried to email the podcasters. I enjoyed to show my support. No one except for Nicole Simone

172
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:33,080
of useful sounds and the iPod Lounge Guy. Father to say, uh, at least say thanks.

173
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,760
Oh, this is interesting. And he goes, this is why I kept this. Of course, podcasting has to compete

174
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,680
for my time. Since I enjoy both XM and Syria satellite radio, medium wave band scanning,

175
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,880
ham, and shortwave radio, I was attracted to podcasts because it felt like a community with some

176
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,720
level of camaraderie. But now it feels disinterested. I think it's just, it's growing, you know,

177
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:06,920
and I have to be honest, it's email. When you do a podcast, what happens is, um, I think even

178
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,440
Dave mentioned this, there's a delay in the comments that, uh, that show up and it actually flows

179
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,880
out over, over time, over a number of days. So there's just so much more that is spread out over

180
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,400
so much more time. Once again, my email box keeps filling up. And that's also mainly because

181
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,760
of attachments are being sent to me. But I just have no, I have no time to manage it. And that is

182
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,200
also partly a bandwidth issue. But still, it's, um, I don't know, email is so broken. It is

183
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,440
so fucking useless to me. It really is. And Skype is kind of the same way now, you know, it's like,

184
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm in the Skype directory. So if I turn Skype on immediately, this 5,000, please authorize me

185
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,440
requests. And I don't even know what happens if I cancel or that, or if I say, I mean, no, I know what

186
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,200
happens if I say, yes, but because, you know, then people can Skype me. And it's not like I

187
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,720
don't want to be accessible or available. But the application Skype has actually just become useless

188
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,000
to me at this point because I'm always getting instant messages all the time from people just say,

189
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,640
hey, or hi, you know, whatever. It's like, it just doesn't work. And I guess the only thing I can then

190
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,680
do is it's basically, you know, get another alias and start over and, uh, only use it with a

191
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,480
select group of friends or people that it doesn't, it doesn't work. Is this maybe where it comes

192
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:35,560
down to what Dave was talking about? Or, I mean, some of it's got to be that, um, about identity

193
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:47,240
and who, I don't know. I don't know anyone who is Skypeing me, really. I think the biggest problem

194
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,480
of these things is, this is what I like about my cell phone. When my cell phone rings, um, and I

195
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,280
don't always have it on me. In fact, oftentimes it says sitting on the charger, you know, connect

196
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,200
hooked up to the charger, sitting on my desk. But, uh, so it, it is always on. So it'll ring and eventually

197
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,000
goes to voice mail, I've like five or six rings. But sometimes, if someone calls and caller ID really

198
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,520
works very well in Europe and certainly on GSM phones and that, uh, that does work pretty well in,

199
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,080
uh, in the States as well, I believe now. But I think it's more, uh, a function of GSM technology

200
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,760
working better with caller ID or just, it seems to work better there. So I always know if it's someone

201
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,920
who's in my address book and I'm pretty meticulous about saving numbers and I sync it up with my,

202
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,480
address book on my Mac and all that works. Um, and but if it's someone I don't want to talk to

203
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,960
or if it's a number I don't recognize, then I can just basically silence the ringer and I just let it

204
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,360
go and it, you know, and it goes to, uh, voice mail. Therefore, not giving the caller any clue if it

205
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,800
was just sitting on my desk or if I was ignoring them or whatever. Uh, I just didn't answer the

206
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,840
phone and it went to voice mail. You can also reject the call, right? So if it comes in and it rings,

207
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,120
you say, I fucking won't talk to this person. You click it, it goes to voice mail. Well, of course,

208
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,360
that's a dead giveaway if it rings more than one, so it doesn't go to voice mail automatically,

209
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,480
you know, the minute you call the number because that's what happens when the phone is off.

210
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,360
Then basically you've rejected the person and they know it, which can have its benefits, but

211
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,120
I don't want to piss anyone off. I just want to have the option of deciding when people know

212
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,320
if I'm, this is it. If I'm, it's the presence thing. I think that's it. I don't want everyone to know

213
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,720
that I'm online. I want a couple of people to know that's what I'm looking for. Uh,

214
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,160
took me a second there. I don't want everybody to know what I'm online. In fact, I want a different

215
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,240
status of my presence in Skype for different types of people or different categories of people.

216
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,040
That would actually work for me. That would be pretty cool. If, you know, you know, like my friends,

217
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,560
if Dave can see that I'm online and available for Skypeing, but other people won't see me at all,

218
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,280
or I guess that's part of the authorization thing. Fuck, the authorization thing is it's not the

219
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,840
way to do it. It's very annoying. It makes me not want to use Skype. It really, it doesn't just

220
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,720
annoys the hell out of me. Um, oh, by the way, I want to thank Dave Winner so much for

221
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:17,640
basically podcasting directly to me. It was so cool to hear his comments about my show notes.

222
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:25,400
And, um, this is where our communications, it's sometimes just hard, you know. We're, we're talking

223
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,520
a lot these days communicating partially through email all of, as I pointed out, that's not always

224
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,040
the best for anyone to communicate with me through email. Um, but usually on cell phone calls,

225
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,600
which is good. The, the quality of the phones of the phone calls and basically the connections

226
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,840
not being drops ever since Dave got his GSM phone on its AT&T wireless. That's been very good.

227
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,080
And, of course, we, I did think every single time the caller ID has worked, I'm both ends.

228
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,840
But, you know, when he calls me, he's probably on the road. He's been driving for an hour or two.

229
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,960
Maybe he just had lunch or before lunch. He's driving through Texas. I'm in the UK. It's different

230
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,000
time, you know. So, you talk about stuff. And, and I'm, we were talking about the show notes.

231
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,920
And, um, at a certain point, uh, I think this is what it is. Where, uh, I sometimes, and I think

232
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,840
it's common that people do this. Where you confuse, uh, talking about what you would do or as an

233
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,680
example, if I were a, fill in the blanks. So, if I am a punter or if I'm, uh, that's what they say here

234
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,040
in the UK. So, if, you know, if I'm someone who's, if I'm a source code listener, uh, then I want

235
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,120
my show notes up front. And, so sometimes it gets confusing where there were, uh, you know, thinking

236
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,960
about, is this, uh, someone who's listening is this you or this me. And, uh, I never, for a second,

237
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,800
doubted that you weren't loyal to the source code Dave, not for a second. But, um, well, forget all that.

238
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,640
What this whole conversation led to is such a boring moment, like damn, of course, that the show

239
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,960
notes need to follow after. And there is a timing factor after the show. And it should indeed

240
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,120
show up into the, um, uh, into your aggregator when you're in link browsing mode. That was what

241
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,280
really hit me as what Dave said in, uh, in his response to, you know, the, the whole concept of show notes

242
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,240
and will people judge the show by looking at the, the show notes before actually listening to it.

243
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,800
And I got comments from other people, um, you know, drew from Don and drew lovely. He said,

244
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,960
he sent an email and said, you know, dude, I said here and, and, and, and listen to the show with

245
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,520
this show notes in hand, I'm like, what's in your other hand, big boy. Oh, tell me about it.

246
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:47,000
And so, um, and then, and then, that's when Dave said it. He said, um, I want the show notes

247
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,680
after. And I wanted to show up when I'm in link browsing mode. Because of course, when you're listening

248
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,560
to the show, you're not really in, in link browsing mode. You're in listening mode. You're in, uh,

249
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,960
driving to work mode or exercising mode. And yeah, you may want to hit a button and, you know,

250
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,640
bookmark, I'd like, oh, y'all go back and check that later. But probably it's just better to figure

251
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,720
that, well, the next aggregator scan after you've received it, uh, I'm just guessing, or maybe it's

252
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,520
half a day later. Maybe that's the way to look at it. You know, then all of a sudden, these links

253
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,200
will fly by and these will be links that you've, you know, you've already heard about, um, and you

254
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,600
say, oh, yeah, that's right. I want to, I want to check that out. And I think that's actually brilliant

255
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,880
because that's, that's what always bothered me about interactive television or the concept of interactive

256
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,440
television. You have to respond immediately. But when I'm watching television, I'm in laid back

257
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,040
chill out drinking a beer or smoking something else kind of mode. You know, I'm just chilling. And

258
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:54,120
I don't want to be link browsing. Think about that though. Think about that. Uh, um, big broadcasts

259
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,240
could really benefit from that theory. Right now, this very moment, they really could benefit from it.

260
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,880
You know, it's like, how do you get the information about the show that you want people to have

261
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,960
at the right moment? How do you time that? That's the, that's the kind of stuff that Ron

262
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:18,920
Bloom loves thinking about and comes up with great matrix matrices. Right. That's right. We got a big

263
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,560
meeting, um, or meetings or hang out or it almost feels like a jambory. It's an on-air jambory.

264
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,560
As we're going to, uh, to Miami, good choice by Dave, uh, at first it was going to be New York,

265
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,440
New York, of course, being, you know, a great place for energy, great place for business.

266
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,440
But I have to agree. I like the idea of 75, 76, 77 degrees,

267
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,400
particularly now because it's getting pretty hold and pretty cold and good old

268
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:53,560
gilford in, uh, in Surrey. Okay. Um, and there was a couple other things that Dave also spoke about.

269
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:03,800
Um, about the Surinami and, you know, I'm, I'm too tired. I want to talk about that now.

270
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,040
But I will come back to that. In fact, I'm copying this node from today's show notes

271
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,520
almost a second. I'm going to put it in for tomorrow because I do want to come back to that

272
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,800
because it really gave me an interesting or a new perspective on just a couple of different things

273
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:27,080
and on life as well. Uh, but it's 10, 10 past 11. I got to get it early. I'm too tired and I have

274
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,080
all kinds of easy, uh, pre-packaged comedy bits just waiting here for you. So why bore you with

275
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,480
the salilically when you have this? Hello. This is Eric Jeffcoat, and I want you to see the

276
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,640
this is just a short teaser for technology instructional technology tips for today's teachers

277
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,360
preparing students for tomorrow. I'm preparing some podcasts for using technology as instructional

278
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,880
tool in the classroom. So, pot in it's teach knowledge with Eric Jeffcoat. The poetic

279
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,440
literations are just some of the many benefits you'll receive from listening.

280
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,000
So, of course, you couldn't check that out in the, uh, in the directory at ipodder.org.

281
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,240
Um, that's where all the podcasts eventually flow through. Um, everything that's new

282
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,680
comes through, uh, oh, man. I almost forgot. You got to check out the IT conversation

283
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:32,680
node in the ipodder.org directory. Uh, Dick Doug K. did such an awesome, awesome job of collecting

284
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:38,120
all of the different feeds categorizing them, putting them into two main categories, one for MP3's,

285
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,680
one for AAC's, which, of course, are, uh, apples. I'm not, sorry, not necessarily apple,

286
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:48,520
but they, iPod plays. I'm, oh, I'm really butchering this. It's a fucking different format

287
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,400
that's bookmarkable, okay? I've been hacking my eye river. I've been trying to get the new

288
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,640
firmware on that that makes it mount as a, as a USB drive. Uh, and it's not working. I keep getting

289
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,320
an error. Uh, actually I should have written down the arrows, a error number, and a negative error number,

290
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,000
uh, but something was wrong with the firmware upgrade, whatever, but I've really found that I like it.

291
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,760
I like this. It's the IFP 799, we talked about it before. I'm still using the I river manager,

292
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,000
but basically what I'm doing is I'm just dragging my entire, um, iPodder download folder

293
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:30,920
into the I river manager, and I just, and I'll just say, yeah, you know, um, replace everything

294
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,880
that you, that you hit up against. It does, I don't, I don't, I don't mind if it takes a little bit

295
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,720
longer to, to re-copy stuff on. Although, of course, it's foolish in, in an efficiency sense of,

296
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,680
of doing things, but I like it because you can basically select a folder and it'll play through the

297
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,200
entire folder or, uh, it's just, you get to do your own file management. You can delete stuff from,

298
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,760
from the, from the device itself. The sound is exceptional, battery life, phenomenal,

299
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,080
like in it very much. It's small. It's, uh, of course, it doesn't play my, uh, audio books that

300
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,120
I download from audible, but otherwise it's one gigabyte fits right on it, you know, so that's,

301
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,480
uh, there's no way I can listen to more than one gigabyte in a day. It's just, it physically

302
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,880
impossible unless it's the highest of high-fi quality, which I don't even think you can encode in

303
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,920
most cases. I like it. I'm really digging the I river. Uh, but if anyone can help me out with exactly

304
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,680
what's going on with, with the, with the firm work I've created and how come I'm not be able to do that

305
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,320
on my Mac, uh, that would be highly appreciated. And I bumped against the, uh, this podcast, uh,

306
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,440
from the podcast brothers, uh, who apparently are setting up the podcast expo, uh, podcast expo.com.

307
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,320
I just want to play a little bit of this podcast because I think these guys are pretty interesting.

308
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,960
They've got a very interesting take on stuff. And they actually are doing a podcast about podcasting,

309
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,960
you know, we need more of those.

310
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:02,920
Welcome back to podcast brothers, our second podcast in so many months. So now we're,

311
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,080
right after Christmas here, so we're going to be doing a podcast for the week about a podcast

312
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:15,240
about podcast. And I guess I'll show about nothing if you will refer to the same film season one

313
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,240
into DVDs that I got for Christmas. Anyway, there were a couple of issues I wanted to air out today,

314
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,480
a couple of things bothering me in podcast world, but I think need to be said, not for the, uh,

315
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,240
your controversy of it all, but, um, I think there's, uh, you know, I refer to a lot of the

316
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,120
butt kissing going on in podcasting world last time, but this is kind of an offshoot of that,

317
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,240
but we're also going to talk, uh, I'm about kissing. Talk about podcast expo, what we're going

318
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,280
to have there and some other things, but we just wanted to have a podcast about the state of podcasting.

319
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,720
And I think that's probably what podcast brothers is going to be all about over the next few months.

320
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,440
So anyway, podcast brothers is Tim Berkwin and Emil Berkwin. And we are brothers with, uh,

321
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,600
love audio, love the internet, and so podcasting is a natural extension of that.

322
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,800
Check them out at podcast expo.com, the podcast brothers. I really enjoyed it.

323
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,520
Uh, these guys seem to have their heads, uh, on straight. I think I think sounded pretty good.

324
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:23,560
Looking forward to the next show. And I was listening to Donandru. Um, I had fallen one show behind

325
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,200
and at a certain point, of course, I thought, oh, wait a minute, my, is my iPod are working

326
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,200
because I, I missed them, but, uh, I figured out that they, um, they, it was like four,

327
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,440
they had some garage band problems. I got a, I really have to call, um, call Drew and, and Don,

328
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,560
well, that's, of course, what I was thinking. I got to call, um, because I want to help Drew out with,

329
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,920
with some, uh, recording, uh, ideas. I mean, I've, I've got a different set up that I'm using now

330
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,840
that I think would be pretty, pretty good for them as well. Uh, of course, you know,

331
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,040
I need to talk to Don, eventually. And then this comes through on,

332
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,640
I'm, I, I river. Stigarettes, f***ing cigarettes. That's what, well, you know that always gets

333
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:16,200
my attention. 12 hundred people die a day from smoking. Yep. That's insane. That is insane.

334
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,880
Think about everybody, you know, that's only when 12 hundred people, right? No.

335
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,080
I don't know. With the show, we know a lot more now. Yeah, we do. Some of you

336
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,280
intimately. That's right. Yeah, no. So here's, thanks for the phone sex. Mm-hmm.

337
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,720
Yeah, there's a few comments. We can't play at the end. A little little risky and naughty.

338
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,600
Just to me. What does that mean, Drew? You can't, what is like, it's like the FCC going to

339
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:54,040
come and arrest you. Why can't I want to hear him? Just, you know, do a not say for work thing

340
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,840
before any, well, I, send an MP3 file. I know. They never send the good stuff to me.

341
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,640
Just, I don't worry. What, yeah, right here comes. And I'm Korean, I are going through a

342
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:14,440
rocky part of our relationship. Yeah. Why is that? He's not ready to settle Don and have kids.

343
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:23,880
He's with a new wife. At this point, Christina heard this. She's going like, hey,

344
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,160
hey, doesn't she know that I'm here? Yeah, I think she does. That has a husband.

345
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,560
Yeah, I can, I can send a wife. I can see the conflict. Why? He's so kind of like you, though.

346
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,080
Are you upset about that? Yeah, um, you guys listen to the sad story. Adam,

347
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:51,480
he doesn't ever call me. And I was even, I'm playing cool, you know, like I'm playing hard

348
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:59,080
to get. Like, I barely ever send him any emails. And like, I never ever, um, really talk about

349
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,720
him anymore in the show. But, yeah, he hasn't called me. What do you, why do you think, Joe?

350
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Maybe it's my fault. Oh, you scared him away. I might have. The real reason, Don,

351
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:27,960
is, I've been unfaithful. I'm sorry. And I think it was just a one-time

352
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:37,400
fling, but I have been unfaithful. I've been listening to another woman. And I got to tell you,

353
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:45,640
she's, she's, she's really doing it for me, Don. Well, hello there. This is Violet Blue,

354
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,600
and you're listening to Open Source Sex. To find out more about me, visit my website,

355
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,680
tinynibbles.com, or simply Google my name. Tonight's podcast is about white cotton panties.

356
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,040
Actually, it's about the feel of a tight corset, or better yet, the way a rubber dress restricts

357
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,400
shines the skin, and sometimes you can see right through it. Would you like it if tonight's podcast

358
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,000
was about the nasty things I do in high heels to let us? Oh, yeah, yeah, please.

359
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,240
It's about all that. Tonight's sexual fetishes are on the menu. What they are,

360
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,440
and how to make the most of them to get off and get off right. I regularly lecture about fetishes

361
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,800
to the students at San Francisco Sex Information. The nation's only ask anything sex hotline,

362
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,760
and you can actually visit them at www.ssi.org. When I talk to the students about fetishes in general

363
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,480
and how to answer questions about fetishes from callers, I also do something for these students.

364
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,400
I seldom do when I lecture. I share my first fetish experience. Okay.

365
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Would you like to hear that first fetish experience on the daily source code?

366
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,040
Yeah, I thought so. I didn't even really know that I had any kind of a fetish,

367
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:06,840
but I was in my late teens, and I was working in Upper Hate, Hate Ashbury, and I was working

368
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,400
at a used clothing store called Buffalo Exchange. While I was working there,

369
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,640
I bought a corset from someone over the counter because I was one of their clothing buyers at the time.

370
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,240
And there was just something about it was this ratty ugly old fashioned corset that really,

371
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:30,920
really tall, long cotton kind. It was pink, totally not my color. I kept it for myself,

372
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,520
and I took it home. I was dating a man at the time who totally thought fetishes were achy,

373
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,400
scary gross, and the people who did them were sick, and even though he was like a rocker musician,

374
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,920
and stuff like that, he totally just thought those people were all fucked up. So I had this corset,

375
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,720
and I really wanted to wear it. So I waited until he was at van practice one night,

376
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,560
and somehow I got myself into this corset. I don't know how I did it. I mean,

377
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:03,160
I used a door knob actually to tighten the laces because I was by myself, and I tightened it,

378
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,160
and I tightened it really, really, really tight. And I wasn't wearing anything except the corset.

379
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,960
I wasn't wearing any panties, I wasn't wearing a top. I wasn't wearing a shoes,

380
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,440
although I did put some shoes on, so I can see what it looked like with a pair of high heels.

381
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,720
And the minute I had this corset on, I just felt, it was like a switch flipped in my head,

382
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:33,480
and I was so horny, so instantly, so fast. I walked over to the bed.

383
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,760
Okay, so if you want to hear what happened, you'll have to listen to open-source sex. It's a podcast.

384
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,720
You can find it in the sex mode of the iPod or an order directory. That's Violet Blue.

385
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:51,080
Check out at tinynibbles.com. It's great. We got to do something about our mic.

386
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:57,320
She has a great voice, and you know that when she's getting into saying something really

387
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,120
sensual and sexy, she really uses her voice, but it's just we got to get a little better recording

388
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,040
about that. That's all I'm looking for.

389
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,360
Hi Adam. I'm the fat posh chap from the Cotswolds. If you're not my testicle, it's to change your

390
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,000
knife. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're the what?

391
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:22,280
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my. Hi Adam. I'm the fat posh chap from the Cotswolds. Okay, the fat posh chap got that

392
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:28,120
from the Cotswolds. If you're not my testicles to change your life, visit the future podcasting at

393
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:37,960
www.mypods4cast.co.uk to have a good day now. Okay, so of course, you know that I would do anything

394
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,800
for my daily source code listeners and after a promo like that comes through on the wire,

395
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,240
you know you've got to go check it out. So I went to my pods4cast.com and it was pleasantly

396
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:55,240
surprised by a financial podcast that actually determines how stocks will perform based upon

397
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,440
well based upon his testicles. Hey everybody and welcome to my pods4cast. Each and every week

398
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,760
might not will change the course of your life. This week they'll make you rich. Maybe have the names

399
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,320
and prices of the 5, 500 companies that have performed best over the past month and also the

400
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,240
5 company who's performed the worst. My selection will be based on the following system.

401
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,480
I would ask my sack a series of questions. I would then cup it as high as I can. The design

402
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,520
of my body means that one nut or settle in front of the other. If my right pod is in the front

403
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,040
when I drop, then the answer is yes. If the left pod is in the front then it's a no. To get from

404
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,800
10 companies down to 5. I'd need to choose which of the two lists I use. So my first question will

405
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,800
be should I use the top forming companies. I will number the resulting list from 1 to 5. I want

406
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,840
to choose this list fairly and as it's an odd number I can't just present half. Need to group

407
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,120
three either with one and two or with three and four. So last question should I group three

408
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,400
with one and two? This will be repeated until we have a result. I must stress at this point

409
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,920
please don't hold me responsible if you lose your money, your friends, your house, your wife,

410
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,680
your kids, or anything else if you trust this system. As this is my podcast and debut

411
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,040
really as untried so probably for the best if you don't put too much money down. Right here we go.

412
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,760
Obviously before any event like this we need to check your equipment.

413
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,440
So I hope you've got a lot of those playboy players. Conditions are um

414
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,800
well good to firm for the record. The top five winners are man group

415
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:43,960
capital group, SAB Miller, Pearson and Rio Tinto. The top five losers are Anglo-American,

416
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:50,840
chorus group, chorus, three-eyed group, Existura and Ken Energy.

417
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,640
OK, SAB. Should I use the top five companies? The cup? The drop?

418
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,400
It's a yes. OK, SAB. Should three be grouped with one and two?

419
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:13,960
No, no, SAB. The drop? It's a no. This is a great exact. Should I use the top group of one and two?

420
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:22,040
The cup? The drop? It's a no again. OK, the three remaining companies. Number three,

421
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:29,720
SAB Miller, currently trading at 870 pens. Number four, Pearson, currently trading at 633 pens.

422
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,280
And Rio Tinto, currently trading at 15 pounds, 35 pens.

423
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,280
Sack should I group number three with the number four? The cup? The drop? It's a yes.

424
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:50,120
OK, SAB. Does the winner come from the group containing three and four? The cup?

425
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:59,160
The drop? Two close to call the cup? The drop? No. We have a winner. It is Rio Tinto,

426
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:06,120
currently trading at 1535 pens per share. Most excellent. On next week's show, I'll be helping

427
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,880
you choose your lottery numbers with the first calls. And also giving the results of how

428
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,240
this share has done. Thank you very much. Goodbye. I love it. We should just, you know, we should

429
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,320
call, we should need to talk to the Sack. That's right. Whenever we have a question about what's going

430
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:34,840
to happen in the future, we just need to ask the Sack. Hey, that's it. I love you, John. I love you, Drew.

431
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,760
I love you, Dave. Morning, doing a night. Good night, Incident. And I'll see you tomorrow.

432
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,640
And that's when we'll be back with another source code, which will come to you from Miami,

433
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,880
FL. And I'll have some broadband, so give it a shot. I mean, that MP3 file again,

434
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:04,440
adamantcurry.com. And of course, please leave a comment on my weblog www.curry.com.

435
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,280
Okay, about 11 30 here, 40 minutes for two minutes for the show for today. Perfect timing.

436
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,160
In seven hours, I'll be getting up. No, okay. Actually, I'll be almost out the door.

437
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,200
For seven o'clock tomorrow morning, I'm out the door. And I should be arriving in Miami

438
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:32,360
around 2 p.m. And I'll probably be able to stay away from the podcast or maybe I'll be uploading

439
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,880
this one. Didn't work out the airport. All right, everybody. Happy new year. Here's

440
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,800
looking at a great 2005, maybe a healthy and happy one for everyone. I'll talk to you tomorrow on

441
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:53,800
the source code. Bye-bye.
