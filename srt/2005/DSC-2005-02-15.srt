00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, this is, hi everybody. Welcome to a special edition of the Daily Source Code. This is for Tuesday, February 15, 2005, which it really is.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's just that here. I'm in the lovely town of Utrecht in Holland. It's 10 minutes to one in the morning.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Tomorrow, I'm leaving it eight for a conference where I'm speaking.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It sounds really funky. It sounds kind of shitty, actually. Anyway.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know what you're doing there, Ken, but you're messing up your intro dude.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's Ken Clark, everybody. You made me laugh.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey Ken, how are you doing? Have we haven't talked in like two or three weeks?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know we were going to try to do this more frequently, and then life caught up with both of this.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I liked it. Life got in the way. I have been working.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, we're supposed to meet this morning. I got up. I was on the computer at like 7.45 and you're like, where you been?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, exactly. I was just about ready to leave because I'm, so I have this thing tomorrow.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was going to have to be this early, so I took the 930 easy jet flight.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I love fucking easy jet Ken. I don't know if you can.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's an easy jet. It sounds like a disposable jet plane.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah. Well, it's a budget airline. The service is Europe, but it's just, it's so perfect.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Everything about it is right. I bought stock in the company. I love it so much.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So it's like a European jet blue.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, I don't know. Probably. I don't know. It's something about the attitude though.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They're whole four minutes right. That's very, very good service. Good attitude as well.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But this has no service. They promise you no service. So anything you get you love, you know,

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and even the little smile from the flight attendant is just like, oh, I love you.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You know, and that's, that's the guy flight attendant. I'm telling you, it's crazy.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't know. If my voice, it sounds like I'm like I'm coming through triple on this.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know what's going on. Anyway. If you sound fine, I'm okay with that.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, but I don't know what I hear is what everyone else will hear.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, whatever. I don't, actually. Yeah. Who knows? It doesn't matter.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So Ken, last time we spoke, we were catching up on the 37 different MTD air talents that you worked with.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So here I had forgotten. You reminded me of a couple like Trixie and Trixie.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yep. People I had completely forgotten about Wendy Westbrook.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But so I had somewhere around 30 mids, some that we talked about.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And we barely got to, to when you and Julie both got hired.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, Jesus.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wait a minute. But it wasn't like four people at once.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We talked about Kevin Seal. How he got us auditioned.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There was only much college campus.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah. I mean, I mean, we stayed on Thursday, by the way.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm having dinner with him with Steve Leads.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, that's right. You're going to New York this week.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah. The big, the big US trip, baby.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, tell Steve. I said hello.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah. We'll do. Okay. I'm sorry. Interrupted you.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Well, I was just going to say JJ left and Julie came and then Nina left and you came.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Right. And then Carolyn Helben.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Carolyn Helben came shortly thereafter and replaced somebody.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Mark or Alan.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hmm.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then Kevin Seal. Alan. Alan because Mark was one of the last ones to leave.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He was still there when I was there.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It was like really weird.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nina was actual. I'm not Nina. Martha Quinn was the last of the original.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And she came back. She kept coming back. Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Once you got hungry.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We got a funny piece of mail after we did that last show to remind me that she had

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
had the dubious honor of playing Tracy Brady Bobby's wife in the 1990s TV movie.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That was great.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was an adult drama or it had Brady's in which Bobby is ever called

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
a quadriplead.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's horrible.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Instead of, you know, Mama was said never to play ball in the house.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They were dealing with topics like Bobby's erectile distance.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It didn't really make it.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It did all right though, didn't it?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Must have done pretty good on DVD.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I did.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I watched it.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It was hilarious.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And Martha was cute.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Even though in person.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She's a little bone. She's too bony for me.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Very, very teeny girl.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I mean, that's one thing we've never mentioned.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Martha's probably what?

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Four foot eight.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's like 90 pounds.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right. It's snappled like a twig.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, I feel tall next to Martha.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're, you know, six and a half feet tall to begin with.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But she had like a putter beat my beer right on top of her head.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Can was beautiful.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So that was a horrible show in the show.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Bro, basketball player came in at one point.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And she barely came to his waist.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think that was shack.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was shack, wasn't it?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think it was.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Look, I barely count the shack's waist.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I hugged him one.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I said, excuse me, Mr. Shack.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You know, I'm tall in my world.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Like, can I hug you?

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And he was like, yeah, that's cool.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's what the reboc.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That was great.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know, we've already, our digressing,

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but it made me think,

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
didn't you do a photo shoot with Michael Jackson one time

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
whereby he had to stand on a box?

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, yeah, I've told that story many times.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, well, I've been on a whole Michael Jackson support rampage,

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you know.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, I have nothing.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I, I, I, I withhold all opinion.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I really do.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I mean, I've met this guy.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If anything is asexual, you know, he just loves hugging people

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and loving people and he's a kid, you know?

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, I, I, I, I don't, I would like to think very much that

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it's not true.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I do think that perhaps he has a screw loose

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
from being too famous and too protected

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
for too long.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But no, you know what, even that's not true.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm telling you that even that is it's all just media

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and what they've made him.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's played to it, of course, but dude,

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
this is like a really well rounded, nice,

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
well brought up human being.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm telling you.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's, it's a, it's a big joke.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And we just, we, we don't want to see it.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We don't want to believe it.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, I tend to always, you know,

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I sure they're a little, the whole family's had a fit

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with us.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But, you know, it's just back to the end of time.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I hear an allegation of this nature against anyone

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that, you know, money is often a very motivating factor.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Fuck, I, I, I tried it with whole chess.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, you should watch that Haraldo thing.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It was pretty good.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Haraldo did interview and, and some of the pieces of it.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I haven't seen the whole thing.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know, speaking of interviews, I saw,

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
we talked a little bit about Daisy Fuente's last time.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She came.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, she did fill in work there for a while.

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
She was the weather girl on a channel,

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
something or other, right?

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Tell him window.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
My new jersey.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've got to see if I could turn you up any louder.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're really soft.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You got to talk to me, you're like,

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, my mic is strapped to my face.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's strapped down.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Maybe my mouth is strapped down.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Is it strapped down?

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, it's strapped.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's better.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Daisy was doing the weather at Tell him window.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Channel 49 or Channel 47.

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She was the, the Latin weather babe.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, I love his team.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And Steve Leaves was there because I remember watching the tape

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and thinking that there was something interesting about her.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But, you know, she was just at the time.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
MTV was very, very milk toast and Daisy was very exotic.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And that just wasn't hip at the end.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Jungle fever on the channel.

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So she went and did MTV int on the nasty one.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean, not till now.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And she could barely speak Spanish herself.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That was hilarious.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She, she, she, she.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's great.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Something about Daisy this week.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I was going to say, I saw a great interview show with her.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But I didn't know that Daisy had lived in Spain as a child.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She was Cuban.

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But I think she had lived in Spain before moving to New York.

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And what's the difference, really?

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But yeah.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She, she, Spain, New York.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Spent most of her time speaking and learning to speak in New York.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Cause Daisy had quite a mouth on her.

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But Daisy was on Rachel,

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
got the chick from the food network that's got that new talk show.

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's a variety of nice, Rachel Ray.

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And network showers on the food network.

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Food network.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And that's pretty happened.

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's just like, right.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, it is.

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And Rachel does this Friday night talk show where she interviews celebrities.

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This last week with it was Dennis Franz from NYPD who last week.

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We before was Daisy went this.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And they were in her apartment in California.

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Making some kind of Daisy was showing her some Cuban dish.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And it was a really cool interview.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So you should, if you happen to catch it, you should.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was like a cool to.

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I remember how with Daisy and see what she was up to.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
She was just engaged or getting married again to some.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Guy was my star guy.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
English pop star guy.

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That should be up in your London then.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Actually, that is true.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She said she was spending quite a bit of it.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
She likes going to London because people don't know her.

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And he likes coming here because people don't know him.

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What is he going to find out who it is?

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Can.

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All right.

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've got to get a name.

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I remember one time was coming.

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I remember that I saw it.

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Right.

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I remember one time was coming down.

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The corkscrew into the, what do you call that?

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The corkscrew into the Lincoln tunnel.

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know what that's called?

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
On the Jersey side.

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
On the Jersey side.

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

235
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Can't remember.

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They had some cute name for it.

237
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And there was some.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Remember I had the roles.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We talked about that.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Right.

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You were waiting in line in the 12 booth.

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

244
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, it was kind of like on that ramp going down towards the toll booth.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And it was before easy pass.

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Exactly.

247
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I had to pay four bucks.

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Maybe it was still 350 there.

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't know.

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I was like this.

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hongken next to me.

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I look over on this.

254
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This little white little Japanese thing.

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It was no way.

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It was a Daisy had a hot.

257
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is funny.

258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
She'll be embarrassed.

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Daisy had a hot.

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Pontiac Fero.

261
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, that's right.

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It was a Pontiac Fero.

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Right.

264
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

265
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's right.

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was white.

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was white.

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That was.

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That was her weather car.

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Moved up.

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right.

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So.

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And then she rolls down the window.

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I'm in the rolls.

276
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I rolled down my window.

277
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She says.

278
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Pardon me.

279
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you have any gray proposal?

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She thought she was being cute.

281
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

282
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, she was.

283
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then I reached over to my dashboard.

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

285
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I pulled out some gray proposal.

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But of course.

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's what made it all the funnier.

288
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
She had a jar of it.

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Did there.

290
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Did you do somebody was going to have to say that to you sooner or later?

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
All right.

292
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So from Daisy.

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
From Daisy.

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
From Daisy.

295
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Carolyn Healthman.

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She was supposed to be the the chicken eggs door from Colorado.

298
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She came and went pretty quickly though.

299
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
She was there for two years.

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And that last year was a constant argument between her and the powers to be.

301
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

302
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But it was horrible.

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I felt so bad for her because she had thick legs.

304
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And big hips.

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm just being honest.

306
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, she was beautiful.

307
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
She was a beautiful person.

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She was very cute.

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She was big.

310
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
She was big bone to can.

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now that they wanted.

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They wanted some glam chick.

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And she wasn't.

314
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No, that's not true.

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They wanted.

316
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's not true.

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They wanted to have a girl next door.

318
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And that's totally what she was.

319
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But then.

320
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Then they wanted a glam chick.

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And instead of just saying, hey, we want a glam chick at the fuck out.

322
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They told her like, oh, you know, don't wear this.

323
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Cause it, you know, you look too fat in it.

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I said, I tried to make her into, they wouldn't let her wear her glasses.

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
She had to.

326
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I felt so bad.

327
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That was because I, it was kind of happening as we were just getting there.

328
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And it was, I got a whiff of that.

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I was like, man, this is fucked up.

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She, uh, she was a Colorado girl.

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was like Carolyn.

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think she went back to Colorado.

333
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And last I heard and last I saw an interview.

334
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
She was producing.

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Local television.

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Really sing, not on camera.

337
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Colorado and was married and had kids and is an avid ski bum.

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, of course she is.

339
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Good for her.

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Excellent.

342
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She came in, did her thing and got out.

343
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And that was it.

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
A New York was not for her.

346
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It was killing her.

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was killing her.

348
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Really cared for New York.

349
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey, look, I only spent a year in New York.

350
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then moved to fucking Jersey.

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I do remember a young, smitten Keanu Reeves, though,

352
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
showing up at the studio and hanging out with Carolyn.

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Really?

354
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

355
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Keanu had a crush on Carolyn, helping.

356
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But during that first year.

357
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Really?

358
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh man.

359
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's happened to think of that.

360
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Forgot about that.

361
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Interesting.

362
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He has a new movie out doesn't he?

363
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Keanu?

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Keanu.

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know.

366
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He was at the, uh, at the Baptist, the British Academy film awards.

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And he was being like, I'll trippy.

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know what I make of him.

369
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sometimes I say movies and I really like him.

370
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Sometimes.

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Sometimes I say movies, but in real life he's kind of weird.

372
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We talked about Kevin last time.

373
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think Kevin, the whole thing.

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And he's back in Seattle when he's married.

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I think pursuing engineering.

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Right.

377
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He was being built, nuclear, a nuclear facility or a bridge or something.

378
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Your facilities are bridges.

379
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't remember which.

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know, I was waiting for easy jet.

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They, of course, they were delayed with that's part of the charm.

382
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Not like, I tried to record it with myself.

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I didn't catch it.

384
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Like, three times they announced, will the atomic physicists translate

385
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Amsterdam on easy jet?

386
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Easy, why?

387
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If I won one one, please contact our company.

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You could use some assistance.

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like, will the atomic physicists?

390
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He was trying to figure out how to tighten the rubber band back up.

391
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It must have been a joke.

392
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They do it three times.

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was great.

394
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That was great.

395
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
All right.

396
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Back to MTV's slime.

397
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is a part two.

398
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We're the way boon units.

399
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh my goodness.

400
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

401
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes.

402
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We've got about very regularly during that period of time.

403
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Dweezle and moon unit.

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Right.

405
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, they were really nice.

406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I always really liked moon unit.

407
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I dug moon.

408
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I thought you was really cool.

409
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Dweezle, I can't say I didn't like.

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Dweezle was just so...

411
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He was out of his mind.

412
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He was in New York.

413
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He was in the chicks and drugs.

414
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And he was totally living rock and roll.

415
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
My mic sound.

416
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

417
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm not sure.

418
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's only where he was at the time.

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No.

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He probably did.

422
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And it was during that same period of time that China can't.

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They're gray slick and Paul canner's daughter.

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Guess VJ every summer for like three years there.

425
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yep.

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And remember China?

427
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yep.

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I do remember that.

429
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Because I know it's probably 14, 15 years old when she first walked in the door and started

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
doing summers.

431
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And the thing with China, first of all, her mom was nuts.

432
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
China was a sweet, relatively unaffected.

433
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes.

434
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah.

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But her mom was nuts.

436
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Her dad was nuts.

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And they would cross by.

438
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
All up all the time.

439
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I got to talk to Grace.

440
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
For hours.

441
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
For hours.

442
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
For hours.

443
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You were talking to Grace Slick for hours.

444
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Love Grace.

445
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
She was wacky.

446
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She was out of her mind.

447
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah.

448
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But she was very sweet and very nice.

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And kind of like they're both like Drew Barrymore kind of people.

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah.

451
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You know what I mean?

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She ended up a potty mouth.

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

454
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And she had Steve.

455
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Now, Kain and Littman were the George Michaels managers at the time.

456
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And this was big fucking, you know, shaking your butt.

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
George Michael, mega, mega fame days.

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And she was all his hanging out with George Michael.

459
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So how he was pretending not to be gay.

460
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That was the big secret.

461
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I think last week you asked me about Bernsey, who first.

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The number of years answered the phones there at the MTV studio.

463
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah.

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
George Michael, we want your sex was the I want your sex hit of the week.

465
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

466
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want your sex.

467
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Bernsey got in trouble on numerous occasions by the management for picking up the phone

468
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and saying hello.

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
MTV.

470
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We want your sex.

471
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Those are the days that we do before John.

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And he had to.

473
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah.

474
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Had to.

475
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course.

476
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Somebody got that complaint.

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Those were the days.

478
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When I look at MTV now and I see that studio overlooking Times Square.

479
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's not somehow, you know, the whole vibe of sitting in the fucking basement, which really was,

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
even though it wasn't a basement, we were next door to it.

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We were on the ground floor.

482
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes.

483
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In the balls of a big brick building.

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Right.

485
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No signage out front.

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Next to Sally Jesse Raphael and all her degenerates walking down the hallway.

487
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
On 57th, we had CBS Street.

488
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No one knew that that's where MTV was.

490
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That was a great thing.

491
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We had the biggest rock stars in and out of there.

492
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No one ever knew.

493
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
No spark.

494
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Nobody knew where it was.

495
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And no one was that.

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The only thing that was near there was the Rolls dealership, which is how I got trapped.

497
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There was nothing to him.

498
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What was the name of that dyno?

499
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We'd always go to it on the corner.

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, God.

501
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

502
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The oldest grace.

503
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No.

504
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The great.

505
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The flame.

506
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The grace was by on Ram.

507
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Wasn't the grace?

509
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

510
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wasn't that.

511
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It was the flame.

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't remember.

513
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And there was a way.

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But there was Tony's Delhi.

515
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It was next door, right?

516
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Tony's Delhi was the little.

517
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

518
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I wonder if he's still there.

519
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Tony is.

520
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think not.

521
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I haven't been down that block in a long time.

522
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But you'll see.

523
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
When was the last time you were roaming around Manhattan?

524
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Dude, it was before 9.11.

525
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You're going to trip.

526
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I mean, if you just go anywhere near like the whole time square 42nd Street.

527
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's Disneyland.

528
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's like a whole new city.

529
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Is it like Disneyland?

530
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's cool.

531
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I mean, I'm like Tokyo.

532
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's like like Tokyo.

533
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I go back as frequently as I can.

534
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But yes, time square is is, you know, when I first got to New York in 84 times square

535
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
was, you know, prostitutes and drug dealers.

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That was cool.

537
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And it was cool.

538
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And then Patricia and I would walk in the middle of the night to light FM to go see

539
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Rick as she flash your boots, which was a right on time square.

540
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We do that at like one o'clock in the morning.

541
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You remember when Rick was, was that when Rick was DJing there?

542
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah.

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He probably still is somewhere, right?

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You know that he's, he's Rick come on the audio guy.

545
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He was basically any light FM station you hear with that guy in the middle of the night.

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's Rick.

547
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, and the funny thing is Rick didn't sound like that in person.

548
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No.

549
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And you could do anything.

550
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You first guy and he'd get in there and it would be like the light at the end.

551
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah.

552
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And you could do anything.

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You call him up.

554
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You call him up on the hot line and you be talking right.

555
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And like, and you go, you have to go, I'm smoking a joint.

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No.

557
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

558
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No.

559
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

560
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We got to set coming up here.

561
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then we, WLTW, let FM.

562
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

563
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He would never crack.

564
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I was fucking great.

565
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Then they put in that whole computer system.

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Like the entire day was wrapped up automatically and computers.

567
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You didn't have to do anything but sit there and talk every few seconds.

568
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And enter the beginnings of the need for podcasting my friend.

569
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Exactly.

570
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I haven't heard the new kind of in the script show.

571
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
By the way, haven't heard it yet.

572
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The Valentine's Day show.

573
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I did hear the Valentine's Day show.

574
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I did.

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Half of it.

576
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I've heard.

577
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay.

578
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It went this morning.

579
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And you know what?

580
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We were stationary.

581
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We didn't travel anywhere.

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Nothing complicated.

583
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No.

584
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I heard the promo.

585
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

586
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.

587
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Just a little.

588
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I just want to curse Don and Drew for a second.

589
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I have to curse them.

590
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because I got the today show.

591
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I, you know, it came in just as I was leaving for the airport.

592
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Right after I skype you, like, you're a fool.

593
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And.

594
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
730 in the morning.

595
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And so I'm.

596
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So yeah, this is like three.

597
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's like 430 my time.

598
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And so I'm ready.

599
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know, the taxi's almost in front of the door.

600
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Toon is home.

601
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm leaving.

602
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Sorry.

603
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And.

604
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So I'm listening to Don and Drew on the way to the airport.

605
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And, and I hear them say, like, well, you know, because it's show number 68.

606
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We want to do 69 on Valentine's Day.

607
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And you have to take, it's a brilliant idea, by the way.

608
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You have to take the survey on the site.

609
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And then you get the secret hidden link to show number 69, which is.

610
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Completely foul mouth just weird ass.

611
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But, you know, so I'm sitting on the plane the whole way.

612
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I think, and we had a delay.

613
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Like, oh, man, I could have been listening to show 69.

614
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Swallow.

615
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Swallow.

616
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Baby, where are you?

617
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And so I curse you.

618
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You actually like the idea of having to go do a quiz.

619
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Great idea.

620
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was blown away.

621
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And it's all these questions.

622
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Like, who do you love more?

623
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don, Drew, myself or God?

624
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

625
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's like perfect.

626
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah.

627
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That was a great idea.

628
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Those guys are smart and talented and funny.

629
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I love them.

630
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay.

631
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So, we've got to do some more here.

632
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Who else do we have?

633
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Andrew Datto.

634
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The great white hope from Dan.

635
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He was very cool.

636
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Very oblivious to everything that was going on.

637
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He just came in and did his thing.

638
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Andrew was very cool.

639
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I think only there for what a couple of years.

640
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But there was friction between him and I.

641
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There was friction.

642
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It wasn't between.

643
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It wasn't because, you know, we had a problem with one of the other.

644
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But I never knew that.

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

646
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There was a little bit of friction.

647
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But it wasn't really like, um, not that we didn't like each other.

648
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It was friction like because they, they'd fuck around with everything.

649
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

650
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Now, let's, Andrew's going to do headbangers ball and then he'll do this.

651
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So he's basically doing all my shows.

652
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Of course, they were testing him out.

653
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But, you know, it was weird between the two of us.

654
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
He knew it was going on.

655
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Trying to shake things.

656
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, God.

657
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because I haven't my list of people that came in around that same time.

658
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Were the pair of Jonathan Solomon and Lisa Edelstein awake on the wild side.

659
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, my goodness.

660
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
With the fucking with the breakfast set?

661
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah.

662
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Several set pieces of which still grace my living room and everybody always comments on them.

663
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Dude, do you remember?

664
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay.

665
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Here's one for you.

666
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So in the early days, I'm talking 88, 89 from me early days.

667
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

668
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's when Sam's set we still had, which was like the Sam's diner.

669
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Sam's diner, right?

670
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And then we had the the booth.

671
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Right.

672
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then so this was this theater seats.

673
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Right.

674
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Right.

675
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That was a stairway.

676
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
That was a really cool set.

677
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So this is the height of MTV exploding creativity.

678
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We were just breaking through on the 40 million households.

679
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Cable was popping wide open.

680
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was a big deal.

681
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And all of a sudden, all these idiot motherfuckers would come through and change everything.

682
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Come with this great new concepts to shake things up a little bit.

683
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And at one point, we had this set designer who for an exor,

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm sure was an exorbitant amount of money created the sand set.

685
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh my god.

686
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's just bring it back.

687
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Everybody come to sleep for a second.

688
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Do you remember that dude?

689
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Well, it was a nightmare.

690
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But I don't remember what happened.

691
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Didn't it involve sand and like gallons and gallons?

692
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's glue.

693
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And it was sand.

694
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Everything.

695
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It was like a couch and a chair and all covered with glue.

696
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It was sand.

697
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Totally.

698
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Forgot that's right.

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
They covered all this furniture.

700
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They like dipped the shit and glue.

701
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And then just cut off the sand.

702
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So stupid.

703
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, you'd sit on it.

704
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No, this sand and shit was.

705
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's right.

706
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And that's right.

707
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You would have to.

708
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And it was like, I think at one point, Julie revolted and would know and refuse to sit on

709
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
sand set.

710
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm not sitting on that fucking thing.

711
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The sand might get a lot of hair and kiss me puns.

713
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We're like too old.

714
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Whatever.

715
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I think of Julie yelling out of the make-up room.

716
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They'd say, we're ready for you on the set, Julie.

717
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And you'd hear her yell down the hall.

718
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Right.

719
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm just rinsing me, no need.

720
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Just rinsing me.

721
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh my goodness.

722
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh my.

723
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah.

724
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So there's a great period of time.

725
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We're Julie was dating Billy Idol.

726
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That was fodder for all sorts.

727
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That was.

728
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

729
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That was pretty funny.

730
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That was Billy was big on MTV at the time and he was up there.

731
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
He was huge.

732
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He was huge.

733
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

734
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh, yeah, boy.

735
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Billy had the best work.

736
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There was some great.

737
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And Julie wasn't that big apart really.

738
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No.

739
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I think had to put up with some serious shenanigans.

740
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Let's see who else is on my list.

741
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Well, Ricky Rackman, who came in when you stopped doing head bangers.

742
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You were just doing.

743
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I think dial MTV and the top 20 video count down at the point.

744
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Right.

745
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Rackman came in to do head bangers ball.

746
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Right.

747
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I think people liked Ricky as well.

748
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, the reason what happened was that tattooed Narlie had been.

749
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Right.

750
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, no, but at that point at that point in time, he was a co-owner.

751
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think of the cat house in LA.

752
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

753
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And that was where Guns and Roses or specifically Axle Rose would hang out a lot.

754
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And so he was buddies with Axle.

755
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And that is pretty much what got him the gig.

756
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And honestly, he was right in the middle of that scene.

757
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And he was kind of right for the LA hairband rock scene.

758
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But not for what he was pretending to be.

759
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I mean, I was, even though I was a fucking poser and had just a whole bunch of pretty

760
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
leather jackets and attitude.

761
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I bought it for leather jacket.

762
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I really was always into the music.

763
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You know, I really was.

764
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And in the beginning, I know a lot of guys that would come on on the head bangers ball

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and go like, oh, dude, like, you really care.

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I was like, yeah, I'm totally into this shit.

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But I could also digs in the other stuff.

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know, but we're friends with like the guys and deaf leopard and stuff.

769
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And Ricky was hanging out with Molly crew and Guns and Roses.

770
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And it was a period of time when LA, you know, that metal scene was all that.

771
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And Ricky was right in the thick of it.

772
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So years later, when we had the office in Los Angeles,

773
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Ken, I bumped into Ricky Rackman at the airport at LAX.

774
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And he was, say, it's what you do, man.

775
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And he said, wow, you know, I took my company public, like, fuck you,

776
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Rackman.

777
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Like, it's like my company public.

778
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I'm like, fuck it.

779
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's some set man.

780
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Look at me.

781
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm wearing a suit.

782
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

783
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And, and Ricky's like, yeah, you know, this is a manager now.

784
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm managing her.

785
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's like porn star.

786
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And at that point, I thought, man, your job don't suck.

787
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah.

788
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Well, yeah.

789
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But I mean, you know, what would a former metal people do in LA?

790
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah.

791
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Hook up with porn stars.

792
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's Molly crew was not back together in hot again.

793
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

794
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What the hell would Vince Neil be doing?

795
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Right on.

796
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What was he managing a strip club or something?

797
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
See how I'd do that until they're getting fat.

798
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There was a TV show on this year.

799
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It was a riot.

800
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I can't remember what channel it was on.

801
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It may have been like the learning channel or something.

802
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But it was a complete physical makeover.

803
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And every week, I don't, it's usually not a celebrity, but they were doing it.

804
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It was probably about four or five, six months before Molly crew announced they were back together and going out in the road.

805
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And it was a complete physical makeover of Vince Neil over a period of, like, four or five months.

806
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Really?

807
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And he had, like, plastic surgery.

808
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He started drinking.

809
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
He got a personal trainer.

810
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
He went to vocal coaching.

811
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Freaks.

812
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Style is hair cutters.

813
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I mean, they fought.

814
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They filmed the whole thing for reality show.

815
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, yeah.

816
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Totally.

817
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I mean, he looked like hell when he walked in the door.

818
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It was like, that's Vince Neil.

819
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, my God.

820
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And by the time it was done, he did it.

821
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
He was doing a solo set at the hard rock in Vegas.

822
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And he had a shit together.

823
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It looked like Vince Neil was totally back.

824
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And then he was a few minutes after that.

825
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They're crewing out.

826
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They were going back on the road.

827
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So unfucking believable.

828
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Although I'm not sure about the drinking because he's already been arrested once on the tour

829
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
for pounding the daylight side of somebody.

830
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He is a baby party and just a little bit of a kid.

831
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I can't imagine the crew on the road without partying.

832
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So let me see.

833
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Do you remember curry?

834
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know, I really like curry.

835
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I really did too.

836
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I, you know, I liked her.

837
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
She was cool.

838
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And then when she got her breast, she was even better.

839
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well, she came from remote control.

840
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Curry started on remote control with Ken Ober.

841
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Ken Ober, Colin Quinn.

842
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Curry were Adam Sandler.

843
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah.

844
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Dude.

845
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
He was on the channel all the time.

846
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah.

847
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I mean, it's amazing.

848
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He got a lot of support from a TV.

849
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But yeah, curry was really, really funny.

850
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And went on to make a bunch of pretty good.

851
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Well, she made a bunch of like, big, great horror movies.

852
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But they were like, good, big, great horror movies.

853
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah.

854
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
She'd like really got maimed and killed and stuff.

855
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It was good.

856
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But she was sexy.

857
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You know, she was played like a scientist too.

858
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

859
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah.

860
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I wanted it.

861
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Well, you had to take the glasses off and the hair just comes full swing down.

862
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Chumbling down.

863
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah.

864
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
My librarian.

865
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That's, that's what Curry were.

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Is it?

867
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Typecast librarian.

868
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Sexy librarian.

869
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Who was Steve?

870
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Steve Trikas.

871
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Steve Trikas.

872
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We almost forgot Steve Trikas.

873
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Steve Trikas.

874
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I forgot.

875
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He was the dad.

876
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He was the Paul Schaefer of remote control.

877
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And you know.

878
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Sorry.

879
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Let me finish all the coughing at once.

880
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You can then edit it out.

881
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

882
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm editing nothing.

883
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This goes out like this.

884
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You never fucking lazy.

885
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No.

886
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Why?

887
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's all the, all the, all the, all the fun stuff.

888
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And you know what?

889
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Let me just say something.

890
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You guys, you edit that too.

891
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Someone's editing on your show.

892
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I wanted to edit it.

893
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Don't edit it.

894
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, I want to hear when you fuck up.

895
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Each show would be an hour and a half long.

896
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Well, started timer, you know.

897
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Then you started timer.

898
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I know.

899
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You, you pull out shit.

900
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
That's not interesting.

901
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Then you have an, an interesting conversation.

902
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

903
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Typically you record for an hour and a half to two hours.

904
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And you end up with.

905
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You're kidding me.

906
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And it's of comedy.

907
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's some five good editing.

908
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Good editing.

909
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

910
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Good editing.

911
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Think of it as audio theater.

912
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, I do it.

913
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
See it to the mind.

914
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
All right.

915
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Now I listen to a two secret,

916
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Lissiveous bitties.

917
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The bitty cast.

918
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
One of, it's a fucking great.

919
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
One of them is in the van.

920
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's van talk with the chicks on the road.

921
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Dude.

922
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm like.

923
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I love it.

924
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Bitty cast.

925
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Hey.

926
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
On Wednesday, Joe's pub or Joe's cafe.

927
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Fuck, I can't remember what it is.

928
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
At nine thirty that they're premiering the bitty cast.

929
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm, I'm so there.

930
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And in the big apple.

931
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Mm-hmm.

932
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Mm-hmm.

933
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That is the debut bitty cast.

934
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That's the debut.

935
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But anyway, so, you know, I think,

936
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Deedra, she keeps saying, well, we'll edit that out.

937
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You know, and I don't know who did the, who did the bitty cast.

938
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But it's in there.

939
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They left it in.

940
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's great.

941
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You're like, don't even say.

942
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You have to say that it's boring.

943
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's not boring.

944
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's fun.

945
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well, I leave certain things in.

946
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You know, some weeks like this last week,

947
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
the Valentine's Day show.

948
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Very, very, very little editing.

949
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Because we're getting better about coming in.

950
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Right amount of time.

951
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Right.

952
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Sometimes we just get carried away and also,

953
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and you're like, holy, shit, we recorded an hour and a half.

954
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah.

955
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

956
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

957
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah.

958
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah, you know, so that's, so that's,

959
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
all right.

960
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Speaking of which, let's do, uh,

961
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
good about ten more minutes, eight more minutes.

962
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Let's do couple more.

963
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay.

964
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
All right.

965
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I was going to say before I gagged before

966
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
who is Steve masters?

967
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Cause he's on my list of people.

968
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Steve Masters, of course, and by the way, I found out his real name. Steve Masters was running MTV

969
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and was eventually fired and replaced by John Reardon.

970
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, I remember John Reardon.

971
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

972
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Hold on a second.

973
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And then he went off and he started the E Entertainment Network because it was the movie channel.

974
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah.

975
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah.

976
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And he was, Lee was a pretty interesting guy.

977
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
He looked like he had been in like a Columbia drug cartel.

978
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, him and Bob Pittman.

979
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh.

980
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Bob Pittman always used to scare me.

981
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Bob Pittman was pretty cool.

982
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
When we first got to New York, we're still living at the Mayflower.

983
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Mayflower Hotel.

984
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah.

985
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Well, who ate?

986
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
No, one of the cats.

987
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Somebody was either a dog or a cat.

988
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It was the cat.

989
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I lost in the Mayflower Hotel.

990
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Stop.

991
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But, um, and it was where we were still there.

992
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And he said, come on.

993
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We'll go to John Cook and Melancham show.

994
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We went to, you know, it was cool.

995
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He picked up a pick up in the limo.

996
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Went to the show.

997
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Went backstage, hung out with John Cook there.

998
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And, uh, he was nice.

999
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But he was definitely like a major league mover and a shaker.

1000
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He was like, Bob Pittman.

1001
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah.

1002
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Big time.

1004
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
No.

1005
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

1006
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I mean, I, I worked at the channel for almost 10 years.

1007
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I met Tom Preston so many times.

1008
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's not even funny.

1009
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I, you know, 20, 30 times over the period of time.

1010
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I was there.

1011
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And every single time Tom would come to the studio or something.

1012
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
He'd come into the room and he'd say, hi, Adam.

1013
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hi, Julie.

1014
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How are you?

1015
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah.

1016
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He was good at that.

1017
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Nice to meet you.

1018
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah.

1019
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And how long have you been here, son?

1020
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I would have been every time.

1021
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And they'd say, this is Ken Clark.

1022
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
He's the, the VJ talent manager.

1023
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You know, you remember him?

1024
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You met him two years ago.

1025
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1026
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah.

1027
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Fine.

1028
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Guarantees, six months later.

1029
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He's good.

1030
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And who are you?

1031
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You know, well, you know, but a cloud follows Tom Preston in my book.

1032
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Hmm.

1033
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
There's a cloud that follows him, boy.

1035
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I think I know what cloud we're talking about.

1036
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Johnny Abbott.

1037
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

1038
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah.

1039
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, let's talk about that another time.

1040
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't want to talk about that.

1041
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And I was going to say that's a sad story because Johnny's

1042
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
somebody that I really, really liked and got a bit screwed over.

1043
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I loved her.

1044
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
She was, she was beautiful person.

1045
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
She committed suicide is basically what happened.

1046
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But that's for another show.

1047
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's a teaser.

1048
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Ken, that's a fucking clip.

1049
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I was MTV's fault.

1050
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yes.

1051
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I totally blame Tom Preston.

1052
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I said it.

1053
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I said it.

1054
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I said it.

1055
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
God damn it.

1056
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, all right.

1057
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Ken Ober and Colin Quinn.

1058
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We glossed right over him.

1059
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't know what happened.

1060
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm going to cover Colin Quinn's done quite well for himself.

1061
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Finally, there was a long dry spell there.

1062
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But then he wasn't through HBO.

1063
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He started to make some shit for HBO.

1064
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And then he hooked up with Ted Demi.

1065
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
He was also passed away.

1066
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah.

1067
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes.

1068
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Unfortunately.

1069
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And then it's Saturday Night Live for a few years.

1070
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Colin Quinn did the news, right?

1071
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Right.

1072
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Well, that was also because Beth McCarthy,

1073
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
who was a director at MTV for a hundred million years,

1074
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
wound up directing SNL.

1075
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
She probably still does.

1076
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Oh, she does.

1077
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

1078
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Beth and I were interns at the same time.

1079
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
She actually worked for Steve Leads for a little while.

1080
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That's right.

1081
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Production.

1082
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We have a lovely relationship.

1083
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Beth and I.

1084
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And then she went into the control room at one point.

1085
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Is it?

1086
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I can't remember.

1087
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You know, she ended up a assistant director and then later a senior director

1088
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and has now been at Saturday Night Live for a couple of years.

1089
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Maybe five, six.

1090
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
More than five, six years.

1091
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And primarily, I think they brought Beth in because she was really good with live music

1092
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and MTV.

1093
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Saturday Night Live's.

1094
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yep.

1095
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Music performances had never been.

1096
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But she learned everything from Milton.

1097
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But that's a.

1098
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
From the Lage.

1099
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

1100
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No, it was the King of Ditty.

1101
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
DV.

1102
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I mean, it club MTV, baby.

1103
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So wait a minute.

1104
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So there's a great connection.

1105
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So club MTV.

1106
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
There was this big thing.

1107
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It was Milton.

1108
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Lage.

1109
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Lage.

1110
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Lage.

1111
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And he was, he was Greek, right?

1112
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Wasn't he Greek?

1113
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah.

1114
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And he was.

1115
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And really cool Greek.

1116
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah.

1117
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And he was like he was smooth and slick.

1118
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You know, like, you wanted to hang out with him because he was kind of cool.

1119
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And he was, you know, who would laugh, kind of like that Mafio so way.

1120
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And very calm.

1121
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And he was direct.

1122
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah.

1123
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But when he was directing, he was like boom boom boom boom.

1124
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But he was funny about he wasn't an asshole.

1125
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
He was a boom boom is right.

1126
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Right.

1127
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Because he was doing club MTV, which was basically that was Julie talking about

1128
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
some music and then, you know, tits.

1129
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That's a best in angelating bodies.

1130
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And what was the club?

1131
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
What was the club?

1132
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
What was the name of that?

1133
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We used to shoot that at the play team, the play team.

1134
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Right.

1135
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Down on 14th.

1136
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Right.

1137
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It was for real.

1138
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And it was all the, it was like club MTV.

1139
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And, you know, then once a month they do four days of club MTV.

1140
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I think it was once every six weeks.

1141
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
They would run out there.

1142
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah.

1143
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And for three days.

1144
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And awesome.

1145
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah.

1146
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And they would do back to back to back.

1147
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You know, all day.

1148
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah.

1149
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Believe me by the 8th or 9th show.

1150
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Julie's Waba was dragging.

1151
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah.

1152
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It was out of baby.

1153
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah.

1154
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But anyway.

1155
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So there was this one chick.

1156
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And she was kind of like the leader of the dancers.

1157
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And her name was Camille.

1158
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Camille.

1159
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Camille.

1160
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

1161
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And Camille at one point.

1162
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Doing well for yourself.

1163
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

1164
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Wait.

1165
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm getting to that.

1166
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Don't blow.

1167
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'll let you do the punchline.

1168
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'll let you go.

1169
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And she had.

1170
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
She had plastic surgery done on her face.

1171
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
She had her breasts.

1172
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It just blown up to enormous proportion, which, you know, Milton totally egged on.

1173
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And once she first had her cheekbone implants put in.

1174
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
She hadn't taken out later.

1175
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
She looked like she couldn't.

1176
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah.

1177
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It was awesome.

1178
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It was really bad.

1179
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But, you know, she was endearing somehow.

1180
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And actually, boy, was she because what happened to little old Camille, the club MTV dancer,

1181
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Ken.

1182
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh, she married Kelsey Grammar.

1183
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Fucking crazy.

1184
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And she's now.

1185
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Isn't she hold on?

1186
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Wait.

1187
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
She is a lead spokesperson for, um, it's something disgusting.

1188
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And I have to do it with your butt.

1189
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Like you're at a bolt irritable bowel syndrome.

1190
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
What's he's posh now?

1191
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know, and she shows up in these people magazine pictorials.

1192
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, yeah.

1193
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
They're California mansion.

1194
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
They're mans.

1195
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Right.

1196
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And you know, and Kelsey Grammar is, of course,

1197
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Kelsey rolled his brand new Viper over, pulling into the driveway.

1198
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's wrong.

1199
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
He's, but he, you know, he's having a good time.

1200
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
He's got that English accent going.

1201
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So you think, like, you know, he's all proper and shit.

1202
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But he's like drinking and he's boozing.

1203
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And he's, you know, and he's having a good time in Camille.

1204
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, please.

1205
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
At the time, he, he went out and bought a brand new Dodge Viper when they first came out.

1206
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Rolled it over, pulling into his own driveway.

1207
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, yeah.

1208
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
She did quite well for herself, didn't she?

1209
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That was nice.

1210
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh, Lord.

1211
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, you know, we're at, like, 40 minutes.

1212
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So we should, we should leave.

1213
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You know, we got to cut it short.

1214
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We need people to keep coming back.

1215
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
For more.

1216
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So we're going to do more on the, on the mysterious Tom Freston cloud.

1217
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay.

1218
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I got to talk about that.

1219
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I really feel bad about that one.

1220
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Well, shit.

1221
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah.

1222
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I want anybody to have a think I'm making light of that situation.

1223
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
No.

1224
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But, you know, I've only written Camille.

1225
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah.

1226
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It is quite a scandal.

1227
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And it got buried.

1228
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
They got buried.

1229
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't know.

1230
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Well, big media company.

1231
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We should pop the car for that stuff.

1232
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah.

1233
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
We should pop that one.

1234
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We don't have a scoop.

1235
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
All right.

1236
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Well, we can talk about that one another day.

1237
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
All right.

1238
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's 130 here.

1239
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I got to go to bed.

1240
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And you've got a big day tomorrow.

1241
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Big day.

1242
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And then I'm going home flying home.

1243
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And I still have to listen to the Don Andrew Show.

1244
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Number 69.

1245
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And the Kenan script show number.

1246
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What it is.

1247
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh.

1248
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It's the Valentine's Day special.

1249
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We don't number him.

1250
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes.

1251
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Indeed.

1252
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay.

1253
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I can just hear Patricia saying, Oh, no.

1254
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Not a Valentine.

1255
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Exactly.

1256
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You said you had to fly up there.

1257
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

1258
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

1259
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, happy Valentine's Day.

1260
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Thank you.

1261
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You too, counting me.

1262
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay.

1263
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I will speak to you soon.

1264
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's always fun.

1265
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Chanting.

1266
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's good to remember old time.

1267
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Good times.

1268
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It is.

1269
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And talking to you and doing this.

1270
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Always remember things that I had long since forgotten.

1271
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So it's good.

1272
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Okay.

1273
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So you got your plugs in, right?

1274
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah.

1275
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
For the Kenan script show.

1276
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah.

1277
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Dusting my brain.com slash KSS.

1278
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Every Monday, new show.

1279
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay.

1280
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
All right.

1281
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'll talk to you soon.

1282
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And another daily source code tomorrow.

1283
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Y'all.

1284
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Bye.

1285
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Bye.
