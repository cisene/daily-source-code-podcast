1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 215

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
July 27th, 2005, it's the source code.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That would be your official daily source code, it's...

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's the show coming to you once again from back home.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Just got my butt off the plane.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That was about 116 million dollars worth of airplane.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I had strapped to my ass.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're back at the cottage.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And guess what?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's raining.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That was a mind-bender from a week of just absolutely beautiful weather in San Francisco.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
By the way, it was really nice here as well while I was gone.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course Patricia says,

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It happens every single time when you're gone and it's beautiful weather.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There you have it.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So it's chilly.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's like a high 50s right now.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's dank and damp and a little bit musky.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But I had a good sleep on the plane.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I slept in aggregate about four and a half, almost five hours.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I figured I'd put together a source code.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
See, we can keep it daily as the name of the show implies.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So once again, Virgin Airlines has done me justice.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Although the TSA is not done me justice.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll talk about that on the show.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know, that's the homeland security, transport security authority, whatever it is.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I've got some awesome stuff lined up for you.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Actually, not a half-ass show.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've got hit test number 50 in today's show.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Youngpalette.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Of course, that's worth the celebration.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've got a couple of promos lined up for you and a mash up as always.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But to kick it off, I want to play something that Abe Dove art from mashuptown.com.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Send me.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I first heard this song, I got to tell you, I got like a lump in my throat.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know, it wasn't quite that I wanted to cry, but I kind of did because it's

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
just so amazing to hear and listen to the lyrics of this song.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I'm a sucker for big power ballads anywhere.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Power rock songs.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Check out Cruise Box.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You'll dig it.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you remember way back last summer?

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
When mainstream radio was such a fucking bummer.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No ending music.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nothing seem funny.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Cleared channel motherfuckers didn't bother money, but somebody heard it wrong.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now you can have it all right.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I heard it on a podcast.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Rock and fucking radio you wanted.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You got it.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just download it and plot it on a podcast.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No one's gonna stop you telling MCC to stick it big in for revisions.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you remember your first computer?

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That piece of shit was like a freaking roller-roader.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now we've got Wi-Fi.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Downloading files fast.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Listen to everyone who's ever done on podcasts.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Listen to me.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now you're seeing each and every nation.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Radio is got to prove it's our imagination.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Need that song.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sing a loud mash it up and exit.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Breathe.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Fucking loads you.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now I'm gonna fix it.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm so bad.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I heard the call.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now you can have it all.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I heard it on a podcast.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Rock and fucking radio you wanted.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You got it.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Just download it and plot it on a podcast.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No one's gonna stop you telling MCC to stick it big in for revisions.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On a podcast.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Rock and fucking radio you wanted.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You got it.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Just download it and plot it on a podcast.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We know I was gonna stop you telling MCC to stick and kill you.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The relevance of ours.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The relation of ours.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The relation of ours.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The relation of ours.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The relation of ours.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're the machete.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're the machete.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,880
Tell the FCC to stick at kick and cruise box.

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
I heard it on a podcast.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Oh, man.

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,320
I must have played this song 20 times since yesterday.

99
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,240
I got it on email yesterday morning.

100
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,680
I'd already recorded yesterday's source code did that late the night before.

101
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,920
And I was like, oh, man, I can't wait to get up.

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,800
That's really, this song was the motivation for me to do this podcast today.

103
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
That is such a kick-ass song.

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
I think I'm going to have to mash it up and mix it and create a new opening for myself

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
with parts of that.

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,280
And it's not just because I mentioned in the song, which, of course, I'm completely

107
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,680
fucking flattered.

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
But wow.

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
I mean, it's a great song.

110
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
It's just cranking.

111
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,560
I played it for Ron.

112
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,280
We were waiting in line at the bank and I had it on the MDA, which, by the way, I've

113
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,640
found out now is called the Blue Angel.

114
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,360
That's the official product name for it.

115
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,640
The manufacturer thinks it was an HTC or something who makes it.

116
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,400
And we were just vibing in the bank and I came home, played it for Patricia.

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,600
She's like, wow, that's a great fucking song.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,800
And I can't get out of my head, man, as I heard it on a podcast.

119
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Love that.

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Love it, love it, love it.

121
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
It's a total fucking anthem.

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Fantastic.

123
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,280
So, let's see.

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,480
We got lots of stuff to talk about, even though I'm a little bit out of it.

125
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,480
But, of course, I have something I've been missing for a week.

126
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,680
Yes, it's right here.

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:08,320
So, my sense, say, oh, you know, you can get, you can owe deons in, say, oh, but, man,

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,920
I still kind of missed it, you know, it's like that perfect combination between not quite

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,080
a cappuccino, but not quite a regular coffee, and you can make it within seconds.

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,280
And I'm not getting paid by the company, by the way, for saying this.

131
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,520
I've sold a shitload of them through my website, but that's just people I hope are sharing

132
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
the experience of a sense, I'm making at least 300 bucks a month on selling these

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
things.

134
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,600
So, but I really do like this product, that's great.

135
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,760
And so, in the curry condo, which is now official, like half an hour before my plane, or

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,200
before I'd to check in for my plane back, we signed for the condo in San Francisco, where

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,360
I'll be spending a fair amount of time for the foreseeable future.

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,680
And so, there's a couple of, you know, it's an empty apartment, right?

139
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,880
So, we're going to have to, you know, get furniture and stuff like that, and oh, man,

140
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,520
lots and pans and forks and knives and plates and you name it and chairs, and, and of course,

141
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,120
they'll have to be a little studio set up.

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,080
And I need a goddamn San Seo machine, otherwise the home was just not complete without

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
it.

144
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:20,280
So, boy, oh boy, let's see, let me just tell you about, oh, the flight back, so Virgin Atlantic

145
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,480
once again, great service, God, you know, it's so perpendicular, 180 degrees, the opposite

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
of Virgin Mobile.

147
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,080
And, of course, we went through that, how poor that service is.

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,920
It's almost as if they heard me talking about them because, you know, it was just fantastic.

149
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,920
There was actually, the plane wasn't completely full, and, you know, Mr. Curry can

150
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,760
we make up, but this bed next to you, so that all you have to do is just kind of snuggle

151
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,800
up, and they have a nice little sleeper suits that you can jump into, and it was great.

152
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,360
Unfortunately, I've seen all the movies by now, so I hope that changes every month.

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,400
You know, I literally have said, and they have a huge selection of movies and television,

154
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,560
and I've seen most of it.

155
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,360
So, you know, landed, you get, yeah, I've gone through this before, right?

156
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,560
You get your fast track, a little purple card, which means you go home straight through

157
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,800
a special line for immigration through customs.

158
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,560
My suitcase, it was there, walked right out as a part of the upper deck service.

159
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,000
There's a limo waiting for you, the guy knew where to take me, it was perfect, perfect.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,480
And on the right home, the cell phone rang, the driver's cell phone rang said, Mr. Curry,

161
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,880
excuse me, it's Virgin, on the line, like, man, I probably left something on the plane, you know?

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,200
No, we just wanted to check and see if everything was okay, if any suggestions to make

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,320
our service better, like, well, yeah, change the movies, but otherwise, I'm very happy.

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,240
Now, what pissed me off is, you know, I bought this, was it two or three trips ago.

165
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,320
I bought this great new suitcase, this two me suitcase, which is indestructible, and it has,

166
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,360
and these, it has a TSA lock, you know, because if you lock up your suitcase, they'll break

167
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,800
the lock to go through it if they feel they have to search your lock.

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,800
And that's okay, I understand that, particularly my bag, it's all kinds of crap in there that

169
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,600
shows up up and scans, you know, I've got the craplet always travels in my suitcase and

170
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,600
chargers and you name it, but as a part of this suitcase is a really nice, expensive TSA

171
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,080
lock, and they fucking broke it off, you know, and until that's a plastic, what's the,

172
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,320
I have to say, we didn't know it here, and they put it up a little plastic tie on, it says here,

173
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,160
you know, to protect you and your fellow passengers, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

174
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,960
passing your screening, blah, blah, blah, as a part of this process, your bag was identified

175
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,800
for physical inspection. If your bag was locked using non TSA recognized locks,

176
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,200
C-A-S, what a C-S, a covenant aviation security, may have had to break the locks,

177
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,720
but the fuck, you know, this like a $20 lock that they broke, and of course the lock is gone,

178
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,800
so, you know, I guess it makes no sense, you're going to have to buy one of those locks,

179
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,600
it's just a scam because they broke it and it has big TSA letters on it, so

180
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:11,160
that was disappointing, but it didn't matter because I was home and my god Christina opened the door

181
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,720
because I didn't have my keys with me, and for like a split second I was like, who's this woman?

182
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:27,880
I swear to god, I got two chicks at home now. I'm believable, so the condo was approved,

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,840
Patricia Doria, I sent her some pictures over email and we already agreed that this was the

184
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,120
place that we should get, but I taken some video and some pictures and some details shots and the

185
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,320
video was really important because you can get a layout for kind of what the apartment is like that

186
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,400
you can't get from photographs and we now had to look quick by to eat and so yeah it's all good,

187
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,720
it's all good home fries, I did use the MDA, the blue angel to write down a couple of things I

188
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,280
wanted to talk about today in the show and by the way I am definitely liking this device and

189
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,200
apart my return I have ordered a new clip on carrying case, a hard case, so you can clip it on

190
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,200
your belt because I'm just deathly afraid that I'm going to drop this fucker somewhere, I've already

191
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:22,200
dropped it actually, it has a little ding in it, but I also, it's a little inconvenient, it's just

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,440
right on the edge of being too big, it's not too big to slip into your pocket but it's a little heavy,

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,080
so this has had a great case to go with it with a quick release, so I can look nice and geeky and

194
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,560
yet get to my phone quickly when it rings, extra battery which by the way is not a luxury because

195
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,160
it does last the day a full work day but it doesn't last the day in an evening, so the secondary

196
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:52,440
battery is necessary, there's still working on it and I got to say this is Windows Mobile 2003,

197
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,080
it's still, I'm not going to say it's buggy but particularly Wi-Fi stuff, it's still not quite

198
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,360
there yet, I find myself getting a little bit frustrated, probably one of every 10 times and just

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,480
hitting the reset button so that I can connect to a Wi-Fi, but I'm happy with it, I really am,

200
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,320
it's my life is now in it and luckily it synchronizes with my Mac, because of course I've synced

201
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,000
it up to the Mac and the crap-let it works both ways, so I got this great pocket Mac program which

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,920
doesn't, it's there's some things that aren't working in tiger yet but excuse me,

203
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,560
let's send sail moment, but I took a couple of notes because I listened to a ton of podcasts

204
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,040
on the flights about 10 hour flight, I listened to the bitty cast hadn't heard the girls in a while

205
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,400
and they've got a kind of the format down for their show while they're on the road,

206
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,400
they put plenty of live performances in there now which I'm digging and there was something really

207
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:00,360
interesting that I heard they were talking about that I didn't know about the U.S. Highway System

208
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,320
and I guess it was, I forget, was it Eisenhower? I think it was, oh and I forgot what they said,

209
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I think it was Eisenhower who installed the U.S. Interstate Highway System and this is something

210
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:23,480
I did not know that the even numbers go from north to south or south to north and the odd numbers

211
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,840
one while I'm saying it the wrong way around, the odd numbers go from north to south

212
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:37,400
and the even numbers go from east west to east, so Highway U.S. one is all the way in the west

213
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,920
coast and of course 95 is all the way on the east coast and then 80 which is kind of like in the

214
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,120
middle, I've been even number that goes from east to west and root 66 of course goes from east to west

215
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,960
and I thought that was fascinating that I didn't know that that grid system was build up that way

216
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,600
and I kind of felt stupid because it makes so much sense and you think that that's something

217
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,640
I've driven a lot in this day something that I would have known but learn something new thanks to the

218
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,120
biddies, hey Adam Scott here for MapleAllRadio.com, I want to tell you about my podcast called

235
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,840
So here's what the schedule looks like for the next week and a half. Recuperation today

236
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,160
after I'm done with the show and I almost don't feel like doing the show notes but I will

237
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,520
am going to force myself. So I'm going to do a pretty tomorrow, plenty of calls lined up. You know

238
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,720
who call me Charlie Rose? That's cool. I definitely want to be on the Charlie Rose show. That's

239
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:41,640
going to be fun. So there's lots of interviews and lots of stuff that's lining up. Then Friday,

240
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,320
I'm sure we'll do some pod show business, everyone. We had some great meetings in San Francisco

241
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:55,080
so part of the small, at this point small core team that we have all flew out and we talked a lot

242
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,200
of strategy and I was it was good. It was really really good but particularly because San Francisco

243
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:08,040
just it has a good juice, you know. Then this weekend the wing commander who's birthday to us today

244
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,560
unfortunately he's going on vacation and I really want to get some stick time in so he has a

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,480
backup pilot. His name is Yamp and Yamp is not an instructor but of course I'm officially licensed

246
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,800
now so I can you know I can fly and he can go along with the safety pilot. He's going to pick up

247
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:32,200
my in laws at Rottenham Airport Saturday morning. He's going to fly the 182RG which is still

248
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,400
located in Antwerp because you know the wing commander won't let me have the plane. It might

249
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,400
position until he thinks I'm good enough to fly across the the channel all by myself which is a

250
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,320
good thing I believe. Then Yamp is going to take me we're going to fly around for an hour or two

251
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,160
and he's going to fly back and so the in laws are coming then Monday Patricia and I are going to

252
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,960
go to London we're going to stay overnight in London. We're going to go to the we've been invited

253
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,960
to the Playboy Party UK so I'm looking forward to that and I've been approved to do a sound

254
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,680
seeing tour. I have no idea what this party is about or what it's like but I think it'll be kind of fun

255
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,240
and we'll turn it off after the party because you know as I said we're you know dude we get to stay

256
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:24,760
in a hotel just the two of us hey that's going to be fun. And so the in laws will be here and then

257
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,240
Friday we're going to leave we're going to go to the States it's vacation time so I think I've

258
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,680
gone through the schedule more or less but the idea is first we're going to go to New York

259
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,120
stay there for a couple days go to Jersey look up the old neighbors hang out a little bit in the old

260
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,880
neighborhood you know it's just to see some folks in New York remember now it's vacation so please

261
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,160
don't go emailing me like hey let's hook up let's talk with me I'm trying to have a little bit of

262
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,840
vacation then we're going to go to San Francisco we'll stay in hotel for a couple days and we're

263
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,680
going to start furnishing the apartment we're probably going to stay in San Francisco for a good week

264
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,280
then we're going to go to Vegas which is going to be a shitload of fun and then from Vegas probably

265
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,400
go back to San Francisco and fly from San Francisco back depends on what the flights are from Vegas so

266
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,640
it will be a two week vacation and I got a lot of good response about the idea of having

267
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,640
members of the pod squad and other podcasters take over the hosting duties for for most of the

268
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,320
shows guys actually there's a lot of stuff that we're doing other producing so we have four hours

269
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,080
of day on serious I'd love to hear match wine scene do a day or dawn and drew you know and rock

270
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,960
will geek and so that's going to be fun it's a Steve Gilmour should do a day too you know and so

271
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,000
I I really want the the pod squad to take over I don't see see Chapman whatever you know

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,720
well there's plenty of time for people to take over the duties in those two weeks

273
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,760
speaking of duties maybe yeah we can get Chris from from the daily download to do it as well

274
00:20:52,840 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm thinking that maybe even the we could do something fun with the pod finder as well

275
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,800
because it's just a lot of work and what I don't want is to be on vacation if say okay well I

276
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,280
got to go back to the room now because I've got to go record something I will do the daily source code

277
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,640
and of course that'll be vacation source code so we'll we'll see if we can break the format up a

278
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,360
little bit do some do some cool stuff let's see also on the way back I was listening to the

279
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,160
rock and roll geek show Michael Butler had a great interview with Tim Ferriss of in excess I know

280
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:35,000
those guys pretty well when Michael Hutchins was still alive they did a couple of concerts that I

281
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,960
hosted I've interviewed them before I think I when I we just moved to New York in 87 and we saw them

282
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,120
at the beacon theater which was although I really liked the band I was disappointing because that

283
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,760
a lot of tape running there it wasn't definitely was not all live that we were hearing the drums

284
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,160
were for sure they were on tape and he talks about there which I have not seen yet he talks about

285
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,760
there the reality show which is kind of like an American idol type show I guess where they're

286
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,840
looking for a new lead singer it sounds like it's cooler than it sounds and Michael Butler is

287
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,360
now a fan of that show so it was good interview and some good insight into the show and I actually

288
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,800
want to check it out now that I've heard that interview and along with that comes a mashup that

289
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:30,680
that just kind of appeared serendipably it takes a new sensation

290
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,800
international note but I'm also like the microphone because I'm a school and I mean I

291
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,840
ready to stay with me because I take this to all the way and I don't know if it's up to be

292
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,600
let's see if what I choose or leave is down and I don't know if it's up to all the

293
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:05,880
comments and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the

294
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:58,600
I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the way down and I don't know if it's up to all the

295
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:15,100
this.

296
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
It's the end of the world

297
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
It's the end of the world

298
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
It's the end of the world

299
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
It's the end of the world

300
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
It's the end of the world

301
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
It's the end of the world

302
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
It's the end of the world

It's the end of the world

343
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
yeah

344
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
Yeah, sticking your ear

345
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,260
You know, if you have zero energy level, this shit doesn't pump you up.

346
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,140
It takes a new sensation mash up on your daily source code today also a special day

347
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,980
because we have hit test number 50.

348
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,900
Let's say, uh, it's time for celebration, of course.

349
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,900
But before we get to that, we've got backtracks podcast number four lined up four, backtracks

350
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
podcast.

351
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,940
So you think, you know, your hits backwards and forwards?

352
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
I like to think so.

353
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Yeah, right.

354
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,940
You're listening to the backtracks podcast exclusively on the daily source code with Adam Curry.

355
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Hey, Adam.

356
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
Hey, how you doing?

357
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Let's get right into this week's quiz.

358
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
I'm a little flush ready.

359
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Yeah.

360
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Are you ready, Adam?

361
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
A little fuzzy today.

362
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Okay.

363
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Here we go.

364
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Alright.

365
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
Number one.

366
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,940
I love you.

367
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
I love you.

368
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
I love you.

369
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Oh yeah.

370
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
I love you.

371
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,440
I love you.

372
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,940
It's amazing how you can hear it.

373
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,940
Uh, uh, we got the beat, the gogos.

374
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,440
Uh, time's up.

375
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Number two.

376
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Number two.

377
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Number two.

378
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Number two.

379
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
I know this one too.

380
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Number two.

381
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Number two.

382
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
This is true.

383
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Definitely, uh, uh, uh, men at work down under.

384
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Time's up.

385
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Number three.

386
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Oh, sorry to see.

387
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Okay, I don't know that one.

388
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
It panps up.

389
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Okay here we go.

390
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Okay. Here the answer.

391
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Number one.

392
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Are you.

393
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Yeah I got this red grain.

394
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Number one.

395
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Let me find you.

396
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
We got the beat.

397
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
We got the beat.

398
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
We got the beat.

399
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
We got the beat.

400
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,180
We got the beat.

401
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,180
And here's number two.

402
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Pretty sure I got this one right.

403
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,180
That's right, it's down under.

404
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,180
And now number three.

405
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,180
I have no idea what that is.

406
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,180
After the love is gone.

407
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
So how did you do Adam?

408
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
Two out of three.

409
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,180

Backtracks podcast.

413

Spin it back.

414
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Man, the production on that is amazing.

415
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
It's like a wall of sound that just hits you.

416
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Cool guys.

417
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Thank you very much.

418
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
I appreciate it.

419
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
This is your daily source code.

420
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Listening to the cinecast.

421
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
I don't know if you've heard that podcast.

422
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,180
It's a really good movie review podcast.

423
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,180
Sometimes a little bit too long for me.

424
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,180
But they always review at least one movie that I'm interested in.

425
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,180
And if you would ask me what is one of my most favorite movies of all time.

426
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I'd have to say it's Willy Wonka, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder.

427
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
And there was something about that movie.

428
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
I can watch it over and over again.

429
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
I really really enjoy it.

430
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,180
And I've been looking forward to the remake, which is Tim Burton.

431
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
I think Danny Elfman did the music.

432
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,180
I think he did the music, right?

433
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,180
And of course, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.

434
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,180
And apparently, and I take these guys' word for it, it sucks.

435
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:35,180
And the part that sucks is the Johnny Depp performance that he really just somehow, from what I was hearing from the cinecast guys,

436
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
really really missed the mark on that.

437
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
I don't know what you're feeling is.

438
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
You might want to let me know if you've seen it or not.

439
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:49,180
But I'm afraid to go see it now because I've such a good feeling about the original that I'd hate for it to be destroyed.

440
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,180
And then I think, well, you know, maybe I should give it a chance.

441
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,180
But I got to tell you.

442
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
Uh, I'm thinking I'm going to take my boys off.

443
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,180
My husband has been hunted, but he doesn't know it.

444
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,180
He holds a secret in a power that could change the world, but he doesn't know it.

445
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Setting this Scottish Highlands Tom Corbin appears to be a symbol tail of a lost boy in his growing attachment to his rescuer.

446
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,180
The beautiful Catriana.

447
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,180
But for Tom Corbin, the rabbit hole is a grave and a dead have something to tell him.

448
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Created by Paul Story, Tom Corbin is a world's first novel written for podcasting.

449
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,180
It's family friendly and enjoyed by young and old.

450
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,180
It's a little different from most sci-fi and deliberately sets a thoughtful pace.

451
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,180
It takes you from a tiny corner in Scotland to events at Span the Universe.

Most of our high spots were coming to us now by TV.

454
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,180
But not this one serious 148 Adam Curry's odd show.

455
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180

460
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Portland Jazz Jams.

461
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:18,180
Pod shows are profound and powerful in their propensity to perfectly portray the

462
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,180
The personification of jazz through the medium of sound.

463
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,180
We're glad you came around as we lay the ground for the new technology we found to bring

464
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:36,180
jazz through the medium of sound.

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:42,180

480
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,180
Okay, I know you're on the road, but let's have a bit of fun with this hit test.

481
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Three intros and this is number one.

482
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,180
Alright, kick and surprise.

483
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180

I'm already starting.

485
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
I'm going to blow number 50.

486
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
I can't believe it.

487
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
I'm sorry, Yarn.

488
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
I have no idea.

489
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,180
And number two.

490
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:21,180
It's either we are family or rockwell.

491
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,180
And the final one is number three.

492
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Hey.

493
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180

00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Don't you forget about me.

496
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,180
I wouldn't dare, Yarn.

497
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
And times up.

498
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,180
And this is answer number one.

499
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,180
The first one and hit test number 50.

00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180

You are my one tattoo.

502
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
I never would have guessed it.

503
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,180
If you're fine.

504
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,180

You are the one I've noticed this goes to.

00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
What the heck was that for two?

00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,180
Give me the thrill that I'm addicted to.

513

We're together.

522
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
As we walk.

523
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,180

I'm going to play that FCC here on a podcast song.

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,040
Again, yeah, I really tripped me out in love with it.

571
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040

00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200

587
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,560
Gmail.

588
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,000
The size of Gmail is increasing, but not as fast as we've seen it increased before.

589
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,240
So I'm still just on a very verge of having to start to the lead stuff.

590
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,640
