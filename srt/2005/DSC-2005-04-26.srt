00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Deadly source code for Tuesday, April 26, 2005.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yo, DJ!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi, yo, Joe!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Next day, yo!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yo, DJ, has only just begun.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Can you do this?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We don't need no sticking turns, man.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's Tuesday.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're at the cottage.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a fuzzy cast.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everybody?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fuzzy cast.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Because I am extremely fuzzy.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hold on a second.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We just make sure we're not clipping on the microphone there.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Everything else set up.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We got the sleep in a bit.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Christina wasn't feeling good.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So they let me sleep until I recorded it.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
10.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There's normally I take Christina to school.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Which I was a little worried about the levels here.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hold on a second.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm seeing some one-two.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's just make sure we adjust all that perfectly for you folks.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, normally I'm up bright and early.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Take Christina to school.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Get the papers.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Get the coffee going.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I've kind of skipped overall that.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the first contact, almost the second human contact I had this morning,

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
was with EZNet.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
My internet service provider.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Once again, crap going on.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're not going to believe this.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yesterday I got a phone call from someone from technical support.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It sounded like an engineer from EZNet.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And he said, and this was what was weird.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He said, hi.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So we're all out of four megabit.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We're just going to hook up to SDSL.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Whoa.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's like an engineer from EZNet.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And he said, and this was what was weird.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He said, hi.

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So we're all out of four megabit.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We're just going to hook up to SDSL.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Whoa.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Whoa.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What just happened here?

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What happened to my four megabits?

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's working, right?

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Long story short.

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're not quite sure what has happened.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But my line, as you remember, went down a couple weeks ago for about an entire week.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then it came back magically.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But indeed, it turns out that I have now only a one megabit line.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've been paying for four, but I have a one megabit line.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And now I'm going to stir up some shit with EZNet.

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This just drives me nuts.

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You know, you buy a business account.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You get all these big promises and service level agreements.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And it's all going to be a wonderful thing.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Takes months to get it hooked up.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then all of a sudden, the old bait and switch, you know.

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And oh, we're sorry, well, we can't provide you with four megabits anymore.

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then just try calling into one of these places.

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You know, you have like 15 different phone numbers.

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And it's all dropping to the same voice mail metrics of switches.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And, you know, usually I always wind up calling sales,

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
because they're the only people who ever answer the phone, right?

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You never get the accounts department.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You never get the technical support department.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So now I've got a guy.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I don't even know if he's technically in sales or not,

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
but he gave me his direct line.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He's really working on it.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But God damn, it makes me so angry.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wow.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Just imagine five years ago, I was already thinking we could do this podcasting type stuff.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I was thinking video at the time, man was I silly.

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We still didn't even have the basic, you know, last mile requirement

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
figured out yet.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And then what's going to happen?

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Pretty soon, cities everywhere will be completely wi-fi.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Will we even need these ISPs anymore?

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Will just be one big giant ISP.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Will it be a part of your taxes?

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You know, this is going to get interesting.

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Very interesting.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm just to fed up with this.

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm really fed up with it.

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So of course I have two lines here at the cottage.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I guess I'll get one of those.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And thank you by the way, everyone who sent me information about how to combine two different networks into a single internal network.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's a couple of boxes out there that do it ranging from like a hundred to three hundred dollars in price range.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So I'll probably just get one of those and combine the two one megabits for now until they figure all this out.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And I'll probably need it for fail, fail over safety because, you know, when you get start going,

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
when you start stuff with them, then things start to get disconnected and reconnected.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I'm in for hell again.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can tell you.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm in for hell.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But maybe some of the hellishness will happen while I'm away because we made plans yesterday.

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to step on the big, big red virgin bird tomorrow night, Wednesday night,

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and fly off to New York, two meetings in New York, then over the weekend.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm going to go out to the west coast for two meetings on Monday and Tuesday, which means I think we'll be able to,

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
maybe schedule some kind of drink or get together or I don't know, somewhere out on the west coast.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We can all just kind of hang out everyone who wants to show up.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Maybe I should do an official podcast meetup.

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Maybe that would be the way to do it.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So I'm a little, yeah, a little out of sorts today.

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Right now it's 10 minutes past 12.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I still have my bathrobe on.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I know that's not necessarily the image you want to conjure up.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I've got my bathrobe on and then I have my brown egg boots.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know if you are familiar with the eggs.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
UGG.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They're called eggs because they're ugly.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But they're made of, what does the deal with these eggs?

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They made of like organically grown sheep or killed few mainly or whatever.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Or they used every single bit of the sheep.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Whatever.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Some sheep had to die for me to have these wonderful ugly yet extremely, extremely comfortable boots on.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I have two pair, one for outside, one for inside.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's how much I love them.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So I guess what they say in the mainstream media is true.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You know, we're just guys and gals in our pajamas.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Really?

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, like a lot of us.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you like it in common ring?

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, get the fuck out because we don't think that shit.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They said we want some to get supporting bath, music, and some day we won.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The simians did a good podcast show.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Get the feeds as podcasts.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't say that they checked on you.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh yeah.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So let's say, I think they have a comedy podcast.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And of course, as with all the daily source code shows, from the show notes,

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you'll be able to find links to a promo's played in the show.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And if you have a promo, send it off to adamantcurry.com,

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
put in the subject line DSC for daily source code, DSC, space promo,

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and then the name of your show.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it'll get routed to the right spot in my email box.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I'll be able to find it again.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm using the cast blaster once again on the PC tablet.

158
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I figured out something which I thought,

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
why was pretty much assured it wouldn't work.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wanted to play just a nice memory tune for you.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Something that'll put me in a good mood.

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I went over to the iTunes music store,

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
bought myself exactly what I wanted.

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That experience is always wonderful.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It downloads.

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But of course, it's only authorized to play on this computer in the authorized players,

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
which would be iTunes.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So I can't play it in the cast blaster,

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the cast blaster fortunately does know how to record

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
from other applications while we're running.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, man.

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This just put the smile on my face already.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Steely Dan, really into the ears.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To get you going on your daily source code.

175
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good morning.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're a relaxing summer.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can see it fit and flat.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So you grab the pieces of something that you think is gonna land.

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, you wouldn't even know a dime

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and if you held it in your head.

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The things you think are precious, I can understand.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you real in in the ears?

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So in a way the time.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you gathering at the geese?

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Have you had enough of mine?

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you real in in the ears?

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So in a way the time.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you gathering at the geese?

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Have you had enough of mine?

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can tell me you're a genius since you were 17.

191
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In all the time I've known you, I still don't know what you mean.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The weekend and the college didn't turn out like you planned.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The things that pass the knowledge I can understand.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you real in in the ears?

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So in a way the time.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you gathering at the geese?

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Have you had enough of mine?

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you real in in the ears?

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So in a way the time.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Are you gathering at the geese?

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Have you had enough of mine?

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Have you had enough of mine?

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Have you had enough of mine?

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Have you had enough of mine?

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Have you had enough of mine?

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Have you had enough of mine?

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Have you had enough of mine?

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Have you had enough of mine?

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Have you had enough of mine?

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Have you had enough of mine?

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Have you had enough of mine?

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Have you had enough of mine?

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Have you had enough of mine?

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Have you had enough of mine?

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Have you had enough of mine?

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Have you had enough of mine?

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Have you had enough of mine?

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Have you had enough of mine?

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Have you had enough of mine?

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Have you had enough of mine?

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Have you had enough of mine?

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Have you had enough of mine?

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Have you had enough of mine?

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Have you had enough of mine?

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Have you had enough of mine?

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Have you had enough of mine?

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Have you had enough of mine?

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Have you had enough of mine?

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Have you had enough of mine?

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Have you had enough of mine?

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Have you had enough of mine?

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Have you had enough of mine?

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Have you had enough of mine?

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Have you had enough of mine?

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Have you had enough of mine?

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Have you had enough of mine?

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Have you had enough of mine?

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have you made enough of mine?

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Have you had enough of mine?

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Have you had enough of mine?

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Have you had enough of mine?

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Have you had enough of mine?

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Have you had enough of mine?

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Have you had enough of mine?

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Have you had enough of mine?

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Have you had enough of mine?

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Have you had enough of mine?

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Have you had enough of mine?

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Have you had enough of mine?

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Have you had enough of mine?

251
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Have you had enough of mine?

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you have enough of mine?

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,440
Stealing Dan, Reelin in the years and a daily source code for April 26, 2005.

254
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
It's Tuesday.

255
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,680
I'm here at the Curry Cottage in Gilford in the UK.

256
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,840
Another great day, rain outside, not very nice.

257
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,240
So I must admit it'll be quite a nice little change to get out and get back to New York

258
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,280
and also onto the sunny left coast of the United States, even though the trip will be relatively

259
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
short.

260
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,480
Now, don't go email me saying, how do you do that?

261
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,680
Why are you playing licensed music?

262
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,160
What I tried to think of in these cases is this is a really old song.

263
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
You probably might be able to find this in the record store.

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,240
I talked over the intro, talked over the outro, bought it for 99 cents, only sharing

265
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
with my friends.

266
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not broadcasting anywhere.

267
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
I've made it unusable.

268
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,240
Clearly, we have to do something about that.

269
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,600
Just give me an option on iTunes.

270
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
Just an option says, buy a podcast license.

271
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,680
That will be really nice, or maybe the record company as well.

272
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,800
We're working all of that.

273
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,880
It's really nice, though, to hear a high quality digital music file, because when you

274
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,880
download from the iTunes music store, it's an AAC, it's not an MP3.

275
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,400
So different compression technique, it's a higher level of, or actually a lower level

276
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,800
of compression, I think.

277
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,560
So the file size is bigger, but the quality, man.

278
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
You forget so quickly.

279
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,440
That's one of the things that I've noticed, you know, whereas we've forgotten totally what

280
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,600
can be done with audio, and particularly with radio, which we're now rediscovering with

281
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,280
podcasting, we've also kind of forgotten what good quality is.

282
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,000
I've never been an audio file, I've never got into the gold connector as all that stuff,

283
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,880
but man, if it's sound is good, it really does, just open up your brain.

284
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,760
It's like breathing oxygen, pure oxygen, instead of just fresh air, you know what I mean?

285
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,400
Or the air around us, typically fresh air, it's so incredibly nice.

286
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,960
And yesterday I was talking about the blind, well, let's go out the blind community, I hate

287
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
that.

288
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,600
Anyway, but blind people, and how podcasting could do so much for them, media wise, man,

289
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,640
I've been delugeed by emails of organizations and all kinds of people who are interested

290
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,720
in helping, and it's just great, it really is.

291
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,160
And what's great about it is, anyone can get started with this, anybody can get a podcast

292
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,560
going, go to ipodder.org, there's many helpful places there that, you know, links and

293
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,760
stories and articles that help you get started, regardless of what kind of computer you

294
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
have.

295
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,600
The basics are an internet connection and a computer with at least a sound card or that can

296
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,120
either has a built-in microphone or you can plug a microphone into.

297
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,560
And then essentially you can get podcasting, and you can even podcast through a telephone,

298
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,000
there's some services out there that will allow you to do that.

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,120
Like openpodcast.org, if you're not necessarily looking for your own domain name, but

300
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,560
even what is it, risen.net has a phone interface, RIsZZN.net, Libsyn, is it Libsyn?

301
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah, Libsyn.com, man, there's all kinds of places.

302
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,760
So let's get it going, seriously, and when you have promos and stuff, send them to me, so

303
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,200
I can point people in the direction, you know, let them know what's going on.

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Got a couple of the great promos today, well, maybe not the best of promos, but certainly

305
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,200
interesting podcasts, I'd like to point out to you.

306
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,960
So don't worry about writing stuff down and rewinding and trying to get the URLs.

307
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,520
All of those will of course be in the show notes for today's podcast.

308
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,040
Yes, I did my show notes a little bit differently.

309
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:38,880
I used the Inline Outliner of my weblog software to create the outline right in the

310
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,040
post itself.

311
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,840
We're still working on, I mean, obviously with the opml part is very important, it will

312
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
become important.

313
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,120
Somewhere down the line, we're going to figure out how to incorporate all that stuff.

314
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,880
So I do want to continue to make opml documents, but I do like rendering just an outline

315
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,280
rendering in the post itself, so that you really have your show notes attached to the same

316
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,760
item that is your podcast, so you have your enclosure, which is your MP3 file, you've

317
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,000
got the description, which talks about what's in the show, you've got your title, etc.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,240
So I've been changing some stuff around.

319
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,580
Also, today's show will be coming from a different server and a different network all

320
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
together.

321
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,760
So we're stepping off at least temporarily to see how it works, stepping off of the dot mac infrastructure

322
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,520
which I've been using for many months now, quite with great results, except for the header

323
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,560
information, which has been breaking reception of many of the podcasts on different iPodders

324
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,440
like Doppler, for instance, which actually isn't Doppler's fault, it's correctly identifying

325
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,280
the incorrect information being sent from dot mac.

326
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,680
So hopefully this will have reached you and I would certainly appreciate any type of report

327
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,400
if stuff broke or if this broke, then you're not hearing me, right?

328
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,600
So you'll probably email me no matter what.

329
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Just our name, people have been extraordinary story, thanksgiving day, I hope that it will

330
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
be.

331
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,760
If you wrote it in my committed suicide, there will be people like me who have been

332
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,480
a trouble with a dark fly.

333
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,520
Oh, I'm a raging alcoholic, the dancers are really good and bad.

334
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,720
I hate our boss, but I love seeing all the fly, shix.

335
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,040
The small world podcast, everyone's got a story to tell, what's yours?

336
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,040
This is the website at smallworldpodcast.com.

337
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I gotta tell you, this is...

338
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Whoops, this is an awesome, awesome podcast.

339
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,480
If you haven't heard WGBH's Morning Stories, which Tony Khan hosts and produced, it's very

340
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,680
much like that only, it's without just remove all the production part, right?

341
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,040
And it's just people who are being interviewed with variety different qualities of microphones

342
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,680
and setups and surroundings, which gives a very real-life feel to it, which of course it

343
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,360
is because these are real people.

344
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,520
Pretty little if any editing and people just tell these amazing stories about themselves

345
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,480
and it's enthralling, you just hear them like, oh my god, you know, wow, listen what

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
happened to this person.

347
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,120
Of course a lot of it is not necessarily great stories, but stories, man, that is still

348
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,560
that something that's in our DNA isn't, it's just storytelling and passing on information

349
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,200
embedded in stories and everyone loves a good story, particularly if it has a happy ending.

350
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:45,720
Of course you know, I'm an American guy, I'll say move, but in Japan, I'll say more.

351
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,760
Hi Adam, and are you listening to the Daily Source Code?

352
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,720
I'm Terrence Young, host of the Kobe Beef Show, a podcast out of Japan, about my life in

353
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,560
Japan, and also featuring a very wonderful Japanese language corner that I would like

354
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,280
you to listen to now.

355
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:16,600
It's the end of the time, let's Japanese!

356
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,040
Today's word is Bottakuri, Bottakuri, which means rip off.

357
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,080
For example, Sotava Bottakuri, that's a rip off.

358
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,120
So next time you want to rip someone off or someone is ripping you off, you can use the

359
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,840
word Bottakuri, Bottakuri.

360
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
That's was today's the over time episode.

361
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,960
Thank you very much!

362
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
Bottakuri, hey, easy now!

363
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Enjoy that!

364
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Bottakuri!

365
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
My podcast, Kobe Beef.

366
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,960
Bottakuri.

367
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,960
That's Kobe, that's beef, dot blot spot, dot com, thanks Adam, there you go, Bottakuri,

368
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
it's a great one.

369
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,240
I can't wait until if we really push this pod save music concept up the chain, it's

370
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Sony Records.

371
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,240
I get to talk to the Japanese CEO and say, hey dude, your music is Bottakuri, you know?

372
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Bottakuri!

373
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Bottakuri!

374
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
Bottakuri!

375
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Bottakuri!

376
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Bottakuri!

377
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,900
Sent to me by CC Chapun from the Aksorn hash pod, cazz details follower, but check this

378
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
out it rocks the house!

379
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,720
yeah!

380
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,220
i moved on without me, maybe one day!

381
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,900
see things the same.

382
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,760
feel sorry I ever felt this way.

383
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,380
feel it sorry.

384
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,380
No one else to play, hey yeah

385
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Time on my side, and after all the dreams

386
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,380
That no one understands for me

387
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,380
I'm feeling fine with this simple dream

388
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,380
And no one understands for me

389
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:29,380
I never saw it coming

390
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:36,380
I expect it, it's really somehow

391
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,380
Feelin' sorry, I never said I can

392
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,380
Feelin' sorry, I never said I can

393
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:55,380
Time on my side, and after all the dreams

394
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:01,380
That no one understands for me

395
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:08,380
I'm feeling fine with this simple dream

396
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,380
And no one understands for me

397
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I'm feeling fine with this simple dream

398
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:50,380
And no one understands for me

399
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,380
Time on my side, and after all the dreams

400
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:03,380
That no one understands for me

401
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,380
I'm feeling fine with this simple dream

402
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,380
And no one understands for me

403
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:28,380
I'm feeling fine with this simple dream

404
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:35,380
Whoa, just pick it in your ear

405
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,380
Oh man, I love that

406
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,380
No one understands, it's Birmingham from Florida

407
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
It's off the CD, life in the stars

408
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,380
And of course you can find a link to their album

409
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
You can actually buy it only five bucks

410
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
You can buy their CD right off the website

411
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Oh man, you want to tell me that that isn't good

412
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,380
I really love it, thank you CC Chapman

413
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Hopefully it'll be sending me some more

414
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
This is awesome, totally

415
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
And I guess if you email the guys

416
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
They'll happily give you permission

417
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,380
To play that track or other ones on your podcast as well

418
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Not bad, not bad

419
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,380
This is Dan at an all-feet of the Florn.net podcast

420
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Did you ever wonder what would happen

421
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,380
If a poet astronomer turned information security geek

422
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,380
Got his hands on Garageband and took advantage of unused bandwidth

423
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,380
Well, find out at the Florn.net podcast

424
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,380
It's my own little brain dump, poetry corner, coffee shop, soapbox and boombox

425
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,380
Caffeine is worshiped, snark is encouraged and BS is not tolerated

426
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,380
Stop by, listen to the Florn.net podcast at Florn.net slash podcasts

427
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
You're seeing you

428
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Alright, so actually what I'd planned on having yesterday or today was

429
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,380
The next strategy cast with Ron Blumen myself

430
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,380
So now I'm not sure if we're going to do that today

431
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,380
This afternoon for air tomorrow or if we're going to do it while on the road

432
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,380
Well together, I'm going to bring my full gear

433
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,380
So I have everything that we need to record

434
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,380
Because it's getting very, very close

435
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,380
I know we've been stringing each other along for quite a while now

436
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,380
But we actually have most of our ducks lined in a row

437
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,380
And I'm ready to start talking about some of the stuff we're doing

438
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,380
Remember, we're mainly about listeners now to start off with

439
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Certainly we need to get more people listening to podcasts

440
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,380
We have to make it easier, have to have more avenues of distribution

441
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Have to get more word out there basically

442
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,380
So that's, that's what we're starting

443
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,380
And that's what we'll be talking about in the next couple of days

444
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,380
I promise

445
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,380
Okay, I'm going to keep it a little bit short today

446
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Because I do have a lot to do

447
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,380
Again, I got like a two hour late start today

448
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
So plenty of stuff to take care of

449
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Before the East Coast wakes up

450
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,380
Which is actually probably just about awakening as we speak

451
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
That's really, that's the only bummer

452
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,380
Even though I'm only five hours separated from New York

453
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
I do a lot, I have long days

454
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,380
All the Skype and conference calls which take place

455
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,380
Now around one PM to PM East Coast time

456
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
So that's eight nine o'clock here

457
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,380
And then you know, you're finally wind up

458
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
It's like, hey, it's the one AM again, damn

459
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,380
So the extra hours were welcome this morning

460
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,380
But man, I'm behind

461
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Hey Adam, it's Dr. Joel, that's the creator

462
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380

Our program will cover news updates

469
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,380
With commentary and opinions

470
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
It'll be interviewing our Thritis patients

471
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,380
Speaking of medical experts about the latest treatments in research

472
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,380
So we invite our Thritis patients

473
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
And their family members and friends

474
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,380
To listen to our podcast at ourthritiscentral.com

475
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Thanks a lot

476
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
All right, Doc

477
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Okay, so check that out

478
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
There's a doctor doing a podcast

479
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
And he's actually selling exclusive

480
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,380
Kind of go to the website and I'll put the links in the show notes

481
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,380
He's selling exclusive content

482
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,380
For I think like $20

483
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,380
You can get a specific types of content

484
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
Which are also a specific podcast

485
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
So he has like a general podcast for free

486
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
He's got a real business

487
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
And I really believe in this

488
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
And what a wonderful topic

489
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Something that so many people deal with

490
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,380
Personally, I've found that

491
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,380
Lots of people like marijuana

492
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
To take care of all the issues

493
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,380
For the hard practice

494
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,380
But and you know what?

495
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I don't have any problems with arthritis

496
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,380
So I'd love to hear your views on that

497
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
Good doctor

498
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
That would be actually pretty cool

Because it is all about pain management

503
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,380

505
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,380

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,380
And the archives

And of course the latest podcast

521
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,380
And I said we're going to be on a new server for this show

522
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,380
So we'll see how well that works out

523
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
I'd love to hear feedback on that as well

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,380

All right

529
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
I'm going to get this thing up to the bird

530
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
Take care everybody

531
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,380
