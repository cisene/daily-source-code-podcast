00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The Daily Source Code Thursday, January 20, 2005.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,760
Yes, Mr. Corey. Yes, this is ten from Starbucks on the manager here, sir. And I'm calling

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,800
to apologize, this is somewhat embarrassing. So the actions of one of our former, and I do

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,560
emphasize former assistant managers. Apparently, this person who I will remain

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:39,080
nameless had a mate at BT. And the two of them conspired to interfere with your efforts

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:49,440
to get broadband at your home. So according to my notes here, they were misguided to say

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,440
the least in their efforts to prolong the exposure our store was getting on your show.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm not quite sure what that means, but that's what it says here. In any case, I do

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,680
apologize and I'd love to offer you three Starbucks for the next year, but this is England

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,560
and I'm afraid the best I can do is offer you my sincere apologies. So I hope you all

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,560
accept them. And now I'm afraid I've got to get on the phone with BT because apparently

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,560
there's several homes on your street that are now receiving broadband who never ordered

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,560
them. So have a good day, sir, and cheers.

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm proud of you casting with Adam Curry.

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,080
Hey everybody, it's the source code for Thursday. Thursday, January 20, 2005, coming to you

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:57,640
from the Ocaro hotel. In Amsterdam, boy, this is maybe a little bit funky. So we're in

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,560
the Laughalier microphone, so I cut down on the baggage rate on the plane.

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:13,560
It's been a weird day. It's really got some interesting news on telephone calls today.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I've kind of been enjoying this room that I scored completely through the weblog.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Watch some of the inauguration, like I could watch anything else on television.

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:43,560
And yeah, just chilled out a little bit. Got a little re-energized.

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,760
Okay, so I actually didn't start to record. I did a little bit of... I tried to do some

23
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,560
sound seeing recording this morning, but it just didn't work out. It was a real hassle

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,560
because I think at first I thought, it's actually really easy to put the receiver,

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,560
while it's receiver in my bag along with the I River recording everything.

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,560
But then I thought, really, when it comes to the sound seeing stuff, I want to be able to hear exactly

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,560
what it is that you're going to hear, because it's totally different that you're ears

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,560
here without listening, listening all the way through the recording device.

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,560
So yeah, and that would mean that I'd have to have all this stuff with me and have to take

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,560
it off going through security, and I just decided to ask for it. I don't know how to do that.

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,560
But maybe another time, another flight. It was another un-eventful, easy jet experience.

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Although there's always that, I don't know where it is. Maybe the, well, you know,

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
actually they're just a very well-run airline, I guess. And at the very last minute,

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I was thinking like, wow, it's 10 o'clock, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 15.

35
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Maybe they should change the, you know, weight for gate announcement to either delayed

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
or to give us the gate. And then all of a sudden, it just, you know, does pop up,

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
and then it's real efficient, boom, you're on board.

38
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Loved it again, completely. And, you know, that whole thing, you know, you throw out

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
your own trash and they come through the aisles with the trash bags.

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
And, you know, so even with your fellow passengers, like, hey, can I borrow your newspaper,

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,560
a guy next to me said, yeah, sure, go ahead. You know, here's the pieces that I've already read.

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,560
And then he said, yeah, the, some candy, whatever, you know, can I offer you some?

43
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,560
It looks like you're kind of like, you're all buddies, you know, on easy jet.

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Totally digging that. So, what's it? Well, of course, I have a lot of stuff written

45
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,560
down and stuff in, in my outline for show notes that we can do today.

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I want to say a little bit about this, about this hotel room.

47
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
First of all, what happened is, I posted on my weblog as I've been doing recently,

48
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,560
you know, who knows a decent hotel room in X, X being the place

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,560
that I'm going to travel that has good Wi-Fi.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,560
And so far, the web is always steered me in the right direction, both for the room

51
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,560
and for the connectivity. And through this blog post, the PR manager for the

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Akura Hotel in Amsterdam, which is, it's beautiful hotel. I mean, I've been here many times.

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
There were actually, I don't think I've actually, oh, yeah, no, Patricia and I actually stayed here

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,560
when we had our first night together. Oh, yeah, that's right, baby.

55
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,560
And so they rebuilt a number of floors and the 22nd floors, the first one that's done.

56
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,560
These are junior sweets. And no one has ever slept in them before.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,560
In fact, there's no one else on the entire floor, which is kind of creepy at the same time.

58
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
But they really did this right. I mean, so I got an incredible deal on this.

59
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm not, not free, but I got a great deal.

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,560
This is exactly the kind of room you want if you're away from home.

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,560
And you need your kind of like your office space, you need to really comfortable bed, you want to be.

62
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
And this is, it's also a guy room, you know, it's got this wood paneling.

63
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
It's totally, that's actually, that's something I just noticed.

64
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
This is a very much a guy interior, not a chick room at all.

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
But they got the nice, the tulips, very nice touch there.

66
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:29,560
And it's very cute. But you know, then they've got the massive plasma screen flat screen, which, you know, I have a flat screen company.

67
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,560
But I'm definitely not a 16 by 9 guy, which, you know, is the extended stretched out screen.

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Because many of the broadcasts that I watch are 4 by 3, which is the regular television screen size.

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
And then these plasma screens, they stretch it out.

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
And I don't like it. I don't like seeing down. I want to see what people really look like. It's weird to look at that.

71
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,560
So then if you switch it to 4 by 3, then of course you have these black banners on the side either side of the screen.

72
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,560
So anyway, I'm not going to mess with the settings. It's fine.

73
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,560
And there's also, I thought it was an LCD, but it is a little mini plasma that's in the bathroom as well. It's cool.

74
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,560
And the service is great. And I'm able to crack a window open. It's really windy. It's been very windy in Europe.

75
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,560
It's been windy in the back in the UK, which I was telling me today.

76
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I got a great view of the entire city. That's really nice. It was foggier earlier on.

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,560
So this is, yes, this is like the ultimate dorm room. You know, it couldn't be any better.

78
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
So I'm totally enjoying that.

79
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,560
How to meeting up with the bunker today with Crystal my PA assistant, well she's one of PA.

80
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
She really does a lot of crap.

81
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Take care of a lot of shit.

82
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,560
And see, well, there's a phone call that I got, which I want to talk about later on.

83
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,560
First, let's just give you a little quick little sound seeing two or of the room.

84
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Because I hold on.

85
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
There we go.

86
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,560
So I'm going to go with the window here for a second.

87
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:22,560
If you can hear the wind holling.

88
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
It's quite a down a little bit.

89
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
So this is the bed.

90
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,560
And walking past the desk into the hallway.

91
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
This is the entrance hallway.

92
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Now I'm walking into the bathroom.

93
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,560
And you can hear the little flat.

94
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
It was a matchline, Philips, matchline, flat TV.

95
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,560
It's a, I don't know if I made it.

96
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
There's LCD.

97
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
It's definitely not plastic.

98
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Or it is plastic.

99
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Yeah, there's LCD.

100
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Cute though.

101
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I have snook her all.

102
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Yeah, it's really nice.

103
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,560
It might actually take a bath.

104
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Now what they also did very well in this room is, the plasma is, and it's a very,

105
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
it is a guy room.

106
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,560
It was totally business room.

107
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,560
So the first channel when you boot up the plasma screen is an info channel for the hotel.

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
The next channel is CNN.

109
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Smart.

110
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
That's what everyone wants right when you walk in.

111
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Next one is CNBC.

112
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,560
The Sally Crochet City Group CFO.

113
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
She's kind of cute.

114
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Maria Bartaromo.

115
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Have you ever seen her?

116
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
On CNBC.

117
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,560
She's cute.

118
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Hmm.

119
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Talk numbers to me, baby.

120
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
But now she looks all like flat and pudgy.

121
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Because of the plasma.

122
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Hmm, okay.

123
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
So the next one is Sky News.

124
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Then it's the hell this is.

125
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
This is BBC.

126
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
They probably got a lot of English people staying here.

127
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
It makes sense.

128
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
They're at right.

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
So here's BBC 2.

130
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Okay.

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Then BBC World.

132
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Now of course the BBC has their 16 by nine shit all straightened out.

133
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
So the screen immediately went to the right proportion.

134
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
That's a big problem with this stuff.

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
These guys saving money.

136
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Most of the commercial stations don't do it just because it's expensive to install that shit.

137
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
You know, the encoders or whatever the hell it is.

138
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Okay.

139
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
So now this is where they fucked up.

140
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
So I got like four empty channels.

141
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Then we hit the local commercial RTL RTL 5,

142
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
SPS6, our old station.

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Here's Jamie Oliver's that's RTL or net 5.

144
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Then we go to German.

145
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
The German net works.

146
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
This is Spanish.

147
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
TV is Spanish.

148
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh, then of course we have an Asian channel.

149
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't know.

150
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
It's got like 15 different subtitles.

151
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Okay.

152
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
TV 5.

153
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
That's French.

154
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
Right.

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
We know Italian.

156
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Discovery channel.

157
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
We're like no audio.

158
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Then we got audio.

159
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Okay.

160
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Lane.

161
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Then we have, what's this?

162
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Okay.

163
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Some kind of info channel.

164
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Then we have MTV.

165
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Not playing music videos, of course.

166
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
The music factory.

167
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Not playing music videos, of course.

168
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Then there's the Snooker game, Euro Sport.

169
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Then there's Bloomberg.

170
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Bloomberg's kind of cool.

171
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,560
It's kind of like a weblog with a video blog in it.

172
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Oops.

173
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Just lost our host.

174
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,560
I was like, Bloomberg TV is kind of interesting to watch.

175
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Maybe a movie channel.

176
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
What is this?

177
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Oh, porn.

178
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Yep.

179
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Yeah, baby.

180
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Oh, cool.

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Okay.

182
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm not going to tell you what I'm seeing.

183
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Do you have your own little fantasy there?

184
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,560
This is a good sound seeing experience.

185
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Alright. Let's see if there's more.

186
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Oh, there's another one.

187
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Oh, hold on.

188
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,560
You got to get some better sound here.

189
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Yeah.

190
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
It's cool. I don't have to pay for it.

191
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
See, these guys are smart.

192
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Just give that shit away exactly.

193
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
There's more channels.

194
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Alright.

195
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
This is the boring part of the porn movie.

196
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Now it looks like that was it for porn.

197
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
What?

198
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
What?

199
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Back to porn?

200
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Okay.

201
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
We'll back up.

202
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Let's back up to the first one.

203
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
No.

204
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I want to go back.

205
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
How'd that cost you?

206
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay.

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Alright, that's enough of that.

208
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
You've had just about enough.

209
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Okay.

210
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Right.

211
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Good.

212
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Well, I've wasted about 14 minutes of your time so far.

213
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Let's have someone else help us out with some

214
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
stuff.

215
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Let me see.

216
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
What was this?

217
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Oh, I think.

218
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah.

219
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
If this is what I think it is, then.

220
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Yep.

221
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
The security is planned for the balls in the parade.

222
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Characters will be positioned by presidential motorcade when George Bush is

223
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
sworn in for his second tour.

224
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,560
That is told just like the first says Michael Moore.

225
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Brad and Jen may not divorce.

226
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Just have a trial separation.

227
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Brad still wears his wedding ring.

228
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
That could be another care of the invocation.

229
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Unless Brad did have an affair with Angelina.

230
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
That would remove the but they were so in love with Tina.

231
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,560
A 67 year old woman had a baby.

232
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,560
The oldest mother in his story.

233
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,560
She took fertility pills for nine years.

234
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,560
They be she lied about her age of his own.

235
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Lazy 63.

236
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,560
The inauguration will go ahead to spline plan protests against the Warren Iraq and the cost

237
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
of wanting and dining Bush's guests.

238
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Not one damn dime will be spend on January 20th.

239
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
A professor's money.

240
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
There knows maybe money.

241
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
But they won't buy cleanest.

242
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Whether the weather is cold or sunny.

243
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Stay tuned for late breaking.

244
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
That's the tap dancing.

245
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Yeah, baby.

246
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Love to hear that.

247
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
The tap dancing podcast news.

248
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm sure there's going to be a new one after the inauguration today.

249
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
So I'll try to get that on tomorrow's daily source code.

250
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Or you can pick it up on open podcast.

251
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,560
It doesn't ever come through with ID three tags identified.

252
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,560
So you're going to like catch it and search through all that stuff.

253
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Let me see.

254
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
It's like late for me here.

255
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
It's 9.38 p.m.

256
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

257
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
That's UK time.

258
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
So here it's 10.38.

259
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
And I'm just kind of tired.

260
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
You know, I had room service.

261
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
It's kind of weird.

262
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It's hotel rooms.

263
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
I'm not a big hotel room fan.

264
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
So it is nice.

265
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
You know, I had this hotel room.

266
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Because I'll trick it out.

267
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
But in essence, it's like,

268
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I like having people around.

269
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
And there's no one here.

270
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
And I had a lonely dinner all by myself.

271
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
I had a steak sandwich.

272
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Let me just remove the porn for a moment.

273
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
That's a little bit distracting.

274
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Just a little bit.

275
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,560
So I don't know how much of the following story I've ever told.

276
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,560
But I'm not going to go into it too in depth.

277
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
A number of years ago,

278
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
I had a partner.

279
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
His name,

280
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
a Simon Cavendish.

281
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Or so we thought his name was.

282
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,560
And I'd known him for a number of years.

283
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,560
And he had made some money.

284
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,560
And with an ISP that he sold.

285
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
And, you know, I'd made some money with my company.

286
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
And I sold.

287
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
And, you know, we'd always wanted to work together.

288
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,560
And so we created a number of companies,

289
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
including an aviation company.

290
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
And, you know, we had a lot of interest.

291
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Writing on, you know, some trust.

292
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,560
And all of a sudden one day he freaked out.

293
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
And it was like, you know, I don't have any money anymore.

294
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Okay.

295
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
So he's broke.

296
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
That's one thing to deal with.

297
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
But my name isn't Simon.

298
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
It's, you know, it was irrelevant.

299
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
I've been wanted by the Scotland yard.

300
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
He was a British guy.

301
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,560
You know, I've done jail time for Grand Theft Auto.

302
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,560
And manufacturing MDMA in a whole country graph.

303
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,560
And he sent this email to everybody.

304
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,560
You know, all employees, bankers, financial contacts,

305
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
the aviation industry.

306
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
So that pretty much destroyed a lot of shit.

307
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,560
And I'm still dealing with a lot of throwback from that.

308
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,560
And so, of course, we were in all kinds of legal hassle.

309
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
It was all bullshit.

310
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,560
I mean, he was, it was bullshit.

311
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
But anyway, took out a call today.

312
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
He died.

313
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Motherfucker died.

314
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,560
In Cambodia, where he was hiding,

315
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
like God dammit, you motherfucker.

316
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,560
You couldn't even, you know, can't finish anything,

317
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
including this, you know.

318
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,560
So it was funny because I got the call and I was like, you know,

319
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,560
I've gotten the someone died call before,

320
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
but I didn't have any kind of shock reaction with this.

321
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
I was just like, fucker.

322
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,560
So, and of course, then I felt a little different later on.

323
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
You know, you go, it's weird.

324
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
It's just weird.

325
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
That's something you don't expect.

326
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,560
And the weird thing is, he has a claim against me,

327
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,560
which continues because he sold that claim to some fucking lawyer.

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
He's a weird ass country man.

329
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,560
So the dead guy is still suing me,

330
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,560
and though he has no leg to stand on literally.

331
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Some other guy should, should the, should they win a suit?

332
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Which won't happen.

333
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Would actually get the dead guy's money.

334
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Is that a fucked up world?

335
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Anyway, I've written that off, fuck it.

336
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
So tomorrow I'm going to go up to Grandmaster View.

337
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
That'll be good.

338
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Hang out with some of the guys.

339
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
You know, hard-working.

340
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
That's a tough business.

341
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
This flat screen business is telling you.

342
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Got this fucking podcast.

343
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Just telling you that, whether they're no good.

344
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
And let's see.

345
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Let's play another promo here.

346
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
This is one of my favorite podcasts.

347
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I really like this one a lot.

348
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
So everybody else.

349
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
This is Richard Smith from yesterday at Radio Ball.

350
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,560
And we have moved to our brand new web address on the internet.

351
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,560
You can reach us at www.rjs.com.

352
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,560
That's www.rjs.com.

353
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Tune in for some great old-time radio.

354
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Gotta tell you, I've really gotten my,

355
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
now that the broadband is back and cranked.

356
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
I've been able to listen to so much more.

357
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
I feel so good.

358
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
And of course, I'm glad that this hotel has excellent

359
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
connectivity as well.

360
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Just so much to listen to and there's so much coming

361
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
through on audio.weblogs.com.

362
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,560
And even email goes so much faster,

363
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
although I'm still kind of swamp with that shit.

364
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Oh, man.

365
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I finally caught up on Madge Weinstein podcast.

366
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Oh, man. I love it so much.

367
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
When it's Madge Weinstein and it's not scripted,

368
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,560
you know, this guy is great.

369
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
What was that?

370
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Someone in the hallway?

371
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm going to try and call Madge Slash Richard

372
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,560
around midnight Amsterdam time.

373
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I think, yeah, right.

374
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,560
That's the only time that we can really connect.

375
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
So, because I've just been, I've been dying.

376
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Some of this stuff.

377
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
I mean, the quote over the week definitely was

378
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Madge Weinstein saying,

379
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Gentlody and some crowning.

380
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
That was just too much.

381
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Again, I'm kind of sick.

382
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
And I've been totally digging using these,

383
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,560
or playing the podcast on my eye river,

384
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,560
which is getting tremendous mileage to one double-a battery.

385
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Storage is sufficient.

386
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,560
In fact, I kind of because I've set it up so that

387
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
it can't go over like a gigabyte,

388
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
which is exactly what I have,

389
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
and it works perfectly.

390
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
It really does.

391
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
And I've been talking about the eye river.

392
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I've got an email from Michael Ellsdiffer,

393
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,560
who says that there's the rock-box,

394
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,560
rock-box project,

395
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
which is at rock-box.org,

396
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
ROCKBOCK.org.

397
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Of course, find this in the production show notes

398
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
for today's podcast.

399
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,560
And they are actually doing some interesting stuff,

400
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
hacking the firmware.

401
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
I think what I've seen is that essentially,

402
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
they've created an open-source version of firmware

403
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
that will let you play back and record.

404
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,560
It's fucked up.

405
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
We'll have to recreate the wheel here,

406
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,560
because the playback and record that I river already

407
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
does is great.

408
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Just like to have a couple of different functions,

409
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
and have a few other things hacked in there.

410
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
And I'm seeing more and more people

411
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,560
figuring out how to do bookmarking,

412
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,560
and then Doug K is put up some script that I've heard about,

413
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,560
which seems complicated for me to put anywhere

414
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
as a PHP script or whatever.

415
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
But you can actually point to a piece of an MP3 file.

416
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I haven't tried it out, but apparently it works.

417
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
And the eye river also,

418
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
if you turn it off or it goes off or powers down,

419
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
it power back up,

420
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
it remembers the spot that you were at,

421
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
and it stays right there,

422
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,560
which I'm sure has something to do with it being flash-based,

423
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,560
instead of a hard disk.

424
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
And if you notice at the beginning of the show,

425
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,560
and now everyone's kind of doing this new show tags.

426
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,560
This was something that I don't know who started this.

427
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
It was when the Apple shuffle came out,

428
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
which of course has no screen,

429
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,560
you don't know which podcasts you're listening to.

430
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,560
So if you have more than one daily source code on your iPod shuffle,

431
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,560
then you can't always tell from how it starts off,

432
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
which show it is.

433
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
So I'm doing these show tags.

434
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
I'm hearing Don and Drew do them.

435
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,560
And Don and Drew, if you haven't heard their episode

436
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,560
where they received a shuffle from one of their listeners,

437
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
they got a great audience.

438
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
So you got great fucking listeners sent,

439
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,560
sent them straight from the Apple store,

440
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
an iPod shuffle,

441
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
and they reviewed it.

442
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,560
And these were the first people that I've heard

443
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,560
talk about who actually used it and played with it,

444
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
and turned it around,

445
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,560
and Don tried to threaten to turn it into a barret

446
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
for a hair.

447
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,560
But it sounds like a pretty decent machine actually.

448
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
And that is, I think, the verdict that Don and Drew gave

449
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,560
on the iPod shuffle is it's okay.

450
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,560
It's a good little box for the money.

451
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
And it also remembers where you left off

452
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
in a podcast.

453
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,560
That was definitely something that was worth mentioning.

454
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
So that's a coffee,

455
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
which is cold by now,

456
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,560
but I need to get something running through my veins.

457
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Because, of course, you know,

458
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
the minute I hit Amsterdam,

459
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
taxi Eric who picking up he always has,

460
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
has something to smoke ready to go.

461
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
So if I don't have meetings,

462
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
which I suppose I have a meeting,

463
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
but I got canceled,

464
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,560
and then so I just went to do all the admin stuff

465
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
with Crystal,

466
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,560
and then came over to the hotel on the afternoon.

467
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,560
So, yeah, I've baked it up a bit.

468
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,560
That's Amsterdam for you.

469
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,560
From Amsterdam, let's go over to London.

470
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Email from Chris,

471
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
as he just started listening to the Daily Source Coden

472
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
as iPod,

473
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
bloody fantastic and weirdly addictive.

474
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Yeah, you'll get over it.

475
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Anyway, it seems that other people send you funny stuff

476
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
for the show you may have heard this already.

477
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
So, Bennett, if not, Bennett,

478
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
throw it toss it in the bin.

479
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
If not, if not enjoy,

480
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
not sure who did it.

481
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
It made sense to me,

482
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
but if you ever use the tubes,

483
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
I'm sure you have, it's bloody hilarious.

484
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
This is about the tube,

485
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
is the subway in London.

486
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
It's titled London Underground,

487
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
and it's from Adaption.

488
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Some people might like to get a train to work,

489
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
or drive in,

490
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
and have been over a mug.

491
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Some guys like to travel in my bus,

492
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
but I can't be bothered with a phone.

493
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
But the bus today,

494
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
I gotta take my bike,

495
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
because once again,

496
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
the tubes aren't strike.

497
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
The greedy bus,

498
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
it's one extra pay.

499
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
The sitting on their asshole day.

500
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Even though they're in 30k,

501
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,560
so I'm standing here in the pouring rain.

502
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Where the fuck's my fucking train?

503
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
London Underground.

504
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
They're all lazy,

505
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
fucking useless,

506
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
come to London Underground.

507
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
They're all greedy,

508
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,560
can't so want to shoot them all with a rifle.

509
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Oh, by the way, this is not safe for work.

510
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
London Underground.

511
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
They're all lazy,

512
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
fucking useless,

513
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
come to London Underground.

514
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
They're all greedy,

515
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,560
can't so want to shoot them all with a rifle.

516
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
London Underground.

517
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
London Underground.

518
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
London Underground.

519
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
The flaws are sticky,

520
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
and the seats are damp.

521
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Every platform has a fucking tramp,

522
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
but the divers get the day off,

523
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
when,

524
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
where we'll wait for,

525
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
working in London Underground.

526
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
While we're awake,

527
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
London Underground.

528
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Take your voice to cut

529
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,560
and shove it up your asshole.

530
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Oh man.

531
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
London Underground.

532
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
What was that?

533
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
That was really good.

534
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I quite like that.

535
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Adaption.

536
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Thank you very much for sending that in.

537
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
And please, if you've got

538
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,560
tunes, podsafe music,

539
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
audio comments,

540
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,560
let me know in the comments.

541
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
I'm going to show you

542
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
some of the things I've got to do

543
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
in London Underground.

544
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
I've got some,

545
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
now I'm getting some cool ead Gmail

546
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
addresses that I'm going to be able to use

547
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
pretty soon.

548
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
I'm working on the sound seeing stuff.

549
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I haven't quite figured out how I want to do

550
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
or how we can work,

551
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
you know, work this together,

552
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
or maybe just become a human aggregator

553
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
and just provide an RSS feed of,

554
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
you know, cool sound seeing podcas.

555
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Because I've received so many,

556
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
you know,

557
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
you know,

558
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
you know,

559
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
I do want there to be a place

560
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
where you can find it.

561
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
So maybe we make that a separate feed.

562
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
In fact,

563
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
that's exactly what I'm going to do.

564
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Maybe I'll even do that tonight.

565
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
So,

566
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
okay,

567
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,560
we'll definitely just write that down.

568
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Hold on.

569
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
If I don't write it down,

570
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,560
RSS feed or

571
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
sound seeing.

572
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
And I'm not going to do a website.

573
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
I'm just going to do an RSS feed.

574
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Right.

575
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,560
And the notes for it will be in the description field.

576
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Make it just real, real simple for everybody.

577
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
If you're new to the daily source code,

578
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
and by the way,

579
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
you know,

580
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
I've gotten into the habit now

581
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
if someone said me email

582
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
that I were a corresponding about the show

583
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
and you know,

584
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
whereas in

585
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
back in the day,

586
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
when I was doing radio,

587
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
you'd say,

588
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
hey,

589
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
hey,

590
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
what do you keep listening?

591
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Well, you'll think,

592
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
hey,

593
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
now I'm like,

594
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
hey,

595
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
stay subscribed,

596
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
really?

597
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Because that's really what it is.

598
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Keep in people subscribe.

599
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Interesting word,

600
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
by the way,

601
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
subscriber.

602
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Subscribers are a big measure

603
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,560
of a lot of internet companies.

604
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Yahoo is measured by subscribers.

605
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
And subscribers don't,

606
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
hotmail subscribers,

607
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
you know,

608
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
MSN,

609
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
messenger,

610
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
God.

611
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
You know,

612
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
it's interesting,

613
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
is that messenger,

614
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
I think everyone has a messenger account,

615
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
everyone I know,

616
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
and it's like,

617
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
it must still be the

618
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
raining,

619
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
instant message client.

620
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I even have,

621
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
you know,

622
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
someone wants to,

623
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
I don't use it,

624
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
but if someone wants to,

625
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I can certainly fire it up.

626
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
And it does keep all of your contacts

627
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
in its accounts.

628
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
So whenever you,

629
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I've seen people log back in

630
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
after two years,

631
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
and all of a sudden,

632
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
they've been re-acquainted with all

633
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
their old buddies from work,

634
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
whenever they last used that MSN accounts,

635
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
they've been really interesting,

636
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
pretty damn interesting stuff.

637
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
But,

638
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
so those of you who have just joined

639
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560

one thing we talk about here,

642
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
a lot on the show is,

643
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
is Cowbell.

644
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Morning, Adam.

645
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
This is Tunnel 2,

646
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
from the LSN podcast,

647
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
over at,

648
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
blog,

649
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
blog,

650
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
hashtag,

651
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
smartman.

652
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
And,

653
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
well,

654
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm not going to talk about that,

655
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
now,

656
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
basically,

657
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
what I'm going to,

658
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
So,

659
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
is this Stigginson,

660
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
yes,

661
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
the Bruce Dickinson,

662
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
is a TV show,

663
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
an L4 Discovery channel,

664
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
its called Flying Heavy Metal,

665
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,560
its on a Wednesday,

666
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
is Wednesdays and it's Wednesday.

667
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
So it's on on Wednesday,

668
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,560
9 o'clock from 9 o'clock from 9 o'clock,

669
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
about topic of planes,

670
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
jet engines,

671
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
and the like,

672
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
today,

673
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
you start at the 707,

674
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
or

675
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
kind of remember the first thing is,

676
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
But that is totally cool.

677
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,220
Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden is doing a show about planes and jet engines and cool

678
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
shit like that.

679
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,060
So, I'm going to see if I can record that.

680
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:14,180
I guess this is from the UK, I mean, okay, so who is Bruce Dickinson of Bruce Dickinson

681
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,180
of course is from the Skit from Saturday Night Live with Will Ferrell and Christopher

682
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:23,220
Walken, which is the Skit by itself is great in the videos floating out there, I think

683
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,780
of linked to it before on the source code.

684
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,860
But what I love even more is the original More Cowbell, don't fear the reaper, the

685
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,260
Coventry mix and it was recent to me, I've had it before because that was the first time

686
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:41,940
I was introduced to the whole Cowbell concept, Chris Copeland sent it to me and I just got

687
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,940
to play it for you right now because even if you've heard it a thousand times, you just

688
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
can't get enough of fucking Cowbell.

689
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,540
Don't fear the reaper, take one, roll, run, one, two, three, four.

690
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:13,740
You sure that was sounding okay?

691
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
I've been honest!

692
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,920
Fellars, sounding great..

693
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:40,720
I could use the little more calmer, I could use the little more calmer, I got to have

694
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:57,040
more calmer, I got to have more calmer, I could use the little more calmer, we're going

695
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:24,680
to want that calmer, I got to have more calmer, I got to use the little more calmer,

696
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:53,960
I got to have more calmer, I got to have more calmer, I got to have more calmer,

697
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:16,760
I got to have more calmer, I got to have more calmer, I got to have more calmer, I got to have

698
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:31,620
more calmer, I got to have more calmer, I got to have more calmer, I got to have a

699
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:41,620
The last time I checked, we don't have a whole lot of songs to teach you the Caldas.

700
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:59,620
I guess I have more Caldas.

701
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Yes, what?

702
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
I got a fever.

703
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:15,620
And the only person who's more Caldas.

704
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Oh, man.

705
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
That is just so legendary.

706
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,620
I love it so much.

707
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,620
Excellent.

708
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Great to hear that again.

709
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
I am just totally wiped out.

710
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
I've got to tell you.

711
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
I'm really, really tired.

712
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,620
I'm just going to turn the big fat ass plasma towards the bed.

713
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Hop in.

714
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
I'm going to cruise through the channels a little bit.

715
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Get some sleep.

716
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,620
I'm big picked up tomorrow at 11.

717
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,620
And I don't know.

718
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,620
Everything that kind of messed up on my first appointment got canceled today.

719
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,620
And then the weather has been so shitty that even though it would be nice to do a

720
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,620
sound seeing tour of parts of Amsterdam, even in bad weather, the wind is just too strong.

721
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Even the wind screen I have on this lovely or mic would just wouldn't cut it.

722
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
I know it wouldn't work.

723
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
So we'll see how it is tomorrow.

724
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:15,620
Maybe we can do something because we're getting towards the weekend.

725
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,620
And we're going to kind of slow the mood down just a little bit.

726
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,620
But wait first, let's do some of this.

727
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,620
This is always fun to be a trivia before we close out the show.

728
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Hello everyone and welcome to mostly trivial.

729
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm your host Brian Pippa.

730
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Today's category is one hit wonders.

731
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:40,620
In 1982, what band had a number one hit with the song, Come On Ileens?

732
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,620
For bonus points, here's a question only the band members, Dick Clark and Adam Curry will know.

733
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,620
What number one song did come on Ileens knock off the top spot?

734
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,620
Okay, Dexie's midnight runners.

735
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,620
Come on Ileens.

736
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
I guess I'm stuck.

737
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,620
I'm no Dick Clark.

738
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,620
The answer is Dexie's midnight runners.

739
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Ileens was a girl that songwriter and band member Kevin Rollen grew up with.

740
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
I just loved that song.

741
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,620
I mean, come on, let's be honest.

742
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,620
First of all, remember the video for that and they were wearing like these,

743
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,620
they were these whacked out guys from down under who actually, I think they look kind of,

744
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,620
they had a good vibe going on, but the thing that was weird was the, you know,

745
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Mr. Greengene's suspender pants, you know, the overalls.

746
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
That sucked.

747
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
That looked stupid and lame.

748
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
I hated that.

749
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,620
And the whole thing about that song was it was like, come on Ileens, right?

750
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,620
You're like, you know, come on, come on.

751
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,620
Everyone knows it.

752
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,620
That's why that song became a hit to start off with.

753
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,620
It got the attention because it had that hook in it, you know, it's like everyone

754
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
to come on Ileens.

755
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,620
We're all singing it, you know, come on Ileens.

756
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,620
And we're laughing and we're smiling.

757
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Our parents are going, oh, the kids have a nice little song with the

758
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,620
Congolung to their relationship became romantic when the pair was 13.

759
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,620
The band.

760
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,620
Ooh.

761
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
I'm boy.

762
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,620
This name was inspired by the infediment drug Dexie drink.

763
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
Okay, that I did not know.

764
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
You said, you got me on that.

765
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,620
Now, about who who was bumped off the top spot.

766
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,620
Who did that?

767
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
What was the question?

768
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Who were they bumped off?

769
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,620
And the song knocked off the number one spot.

770
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,620
The song knocked off the number one spot.

771
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Gosh.

772
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,620
Here the wind.

773
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,620
Yeah, now's really picking up.

774
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,620
All right, I give up.

775
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
Michael Jackson.

776
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,620
Oh, Billy Jean.

777
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
Yeah, of course.

778
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
You should ask him any more.

779
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,620
Can you found it songfacts.com?

780
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,620
To suggest a trivia question, leave me feedback.

781
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Comments.

782
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Questions?

783
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,620
Is it mostly trivial.com?

784
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
Thanks for listening.

785
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,620
So before I leave you for today and we're almost at the perfect weight.

786
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,620
Almost 40 minutes.

787
00:38:53,620 --> 00:39:02,620
I've been privy to a couple of screenshots of the new iPod or lemon version.

788
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,620
And here there's also a new iPod or X version coming out.

789
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,620
I haven't seen anything from that yet.

790
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,620
But stuff's looking really good.

791
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,620
And there's some great features.

792
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
And I can't wait to try them out.

793
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,620
In fact, I'm also buying a Windows machine for a number of...

794
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,620
I don't know if I told you about this.

795
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
But one is to get the Skype phone for Patricia.

796
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,620
And also, I want to try out some of these Windows iPodters because, you know, shoot.

797
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
And I'm still in the minority here.

798
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,620
And I'm really not seeing a lot of progress.

799
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,620
And a lot of the stuff that we need to make podcasting really fucking simple.

800
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,620
You know, we've seen some interesting tools.

801
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
I haven't had an update on Maccast Live.

802
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
I really like that.

803
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
And I really want to try that out.

804
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
But, you know, go to have a Windows machine.

805
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
And I guess I got to figure out.net.

806
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,620
I guess I just kind of installed that like Java or whatever.

807
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,620
So that should be too hard.

808
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,620
But I'm definitely going to get a Windows machine.

809
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,620
Because I feel like I'm not totally living in the world where a lot of people are.

810
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,620
And we still got to figure out, you know, how to make it easier to just create a podcast.

811
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Including your podcast feed and everything just kind of work.

812
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,620
So I've been thinking about that.

813
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,620
So I'm thinking about you, y'all.

814
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,620
You know, that's just the love I'm saying.

815
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,620
I'm excited.

816
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,620
I'm so excited.

817
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
I'm so excited.

818
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,620
I'm so excited.

819
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,620
So I'm so excited.

820
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,620
I'm so excited.

821
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,620
I'm so excited.

822
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,620
I'm so excited.

823
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Oh, yeah.

824
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:33,020
For the Thursday, January 20th, and it was a fun hangin' out with you for a couple of minutes here tonight.

825
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,220
Okay, hope you had a good time.

826
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Tomorrow, I'll figure something fun to do.

827
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
We'll come up with some shit that we get into.

828
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,220
Right now, I just got to go to bed at this time.

829
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,620
Actually, I'm gonna see if I can get an earlier flight back to our night.

830
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,420
Maybe I'll figure out a way to record that.

831
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,420
They will put the microphone through the X-ray machine for our time.

832
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:01,220
And once I'm through that, then I pretty much can just go on the plane with a transmitter, right?

833
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:11,020
I know it doesn't interfere with any of the antibiotics because we've tried that in all kinds of airplanes.

834
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,020
I guess.

835
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:20,220
Alright, feedback was np3 feedback at gmail.com.

836
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,820
And out of the Prairie.com, I just want to send out an email.

837
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,020
And of course, the weblog is www.prairie.com.

838
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,620
I'll see you tomorrow for the thank god it's Friday edition of the Daily Source Go.

839
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
Bye-bye.
