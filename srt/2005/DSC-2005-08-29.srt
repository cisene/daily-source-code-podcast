1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sherechari 230.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're DJ.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm your DJ!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We don't need no sticking friends, you?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I gotta tell you, just keep on getting fun,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or doing these shows.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a source code for Monday, everybody.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How are you? How are you? How are you?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And that would be Monday, August 29th.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We are awaiting the arrival of Katrina in New Orleans.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Southern states there, not much news as of right now.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is 2 p.m. in the afternoon in the cottage.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's where we're bringing you the show from today, once again.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It looks like plans have changed once again.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll be off to Nueva Yorker.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think on the 5th of September for just a couple days,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
then I'll come back.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh yeah, it gets even better.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then I'll go off to New York Chicago Santa Fe.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, it's gonna be a real busy month, the month of September.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Besides the fact that it's my 41st birthday on the 3rd.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't think you're supposed to celebrate the 41st.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Isn't that like a plastic plus,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
birthday, 41, something like that?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Damn, I'm home.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I did a lot of production work over the weekend,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
created the 5th of the supposedly 4 episodes

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
of the Spike Lee Inside Man podcast.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There was an awesome human human,

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
our shadowcaster went back on the set

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
by a special arrangement with Spike,

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
who just did not want to do only 4 episodes.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And we got some great stuff, some great,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
a lot of safe footage,

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but it is audio footage of actual shooting on the set.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And of course, Spike goes off again as usual.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So feel free to look out for that in your iTunes

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
if you're subscribed to the Inside Man podcast.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I got a new production system,

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
which I'll talk about, using a new outliner.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And that means incredibly well organized today.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're going to kick it off with a mashup.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's from the Agro1 week over at mashuptown.com.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Agro1's got Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson under pressure.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,040
mashups and purchasing tracks from that little bit later on the show.

151
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,640
Podsafe, the music on the way, of course, plenty of promos, and as I said, I've really got

152
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,160
my production set up all everything's together now and it really motivates me, I really feel

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,080
like doing, I want to do a show, I want to, yes that I had my the digital audio workstation,

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,400
I had, I was using it as a remote to control deck on the other Mac so I could actually

155
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,600
control the faders by using the faders on the, on the workstation.

156
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,600
That was cool, I mean, I've known it's been possible for a long, long time through MIDI,

157
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,800
it's basically you turn it into a MIDI controller, but it really, you know, it saved a lot of

158
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,440
time actually on setting volumes and stuff, but it was just fun, I've got the crapload set up on

159
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,520
the top shelf here, I've got it wired through the board so if anyone were to call on Skype,

160
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,600
I mean, literally now I can see my mail coming in, I've got my Skype set up, I even worked on some

161
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,480
of the samples, the on board samples that you can load into the workstation. Now of course the

162
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,760
stuff that I want to load in is more than the memory will allow, but it has a couple of

163
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,760
interesting little bits preloaded in there, you heard the one at the beginning of the show.

164
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
Okay, all right, maybe it wasn't all that spectacular.

165
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,680
Lots of stuff from the mail bag, as I've been scurrying between 98 and 100% on my

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Gmail allocation, Jeff Garcide said he listened to the August 24th podcast and was wondering

167
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I thought he would share his experiences about his British Airways flight from Moscow.

168
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,680
Now we've talked about this that Gate Gourmet has gone on strike and there was no food on the flight,

169
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,920
and there are no food on any flights on British Airways. I don't think that they've gotten

170
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,960
it back into full swing yet. As Jeff writes, while the plane was being refueled, I wonder what

171
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,240
it was refueling, it was refueling in Germany or somewhere. The stewards and stewarders had gone

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,640
out and purchased food for the passengers. Each passenger was then given to bag of food,

173
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,840
so as they boarded the ple-reboarded the plane, in the bag was an Apple banana,

174
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,400
canopy, sandwich, and a Mars bar. Personally, Jeff thought it was the best selection of food

175
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,120
you'd ever had on a flight anywhere. So much nice to be able to eat when he felt like it rather

176
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,600
than the slice of time that they have to put the food in front of him. Yeah, okay Jeff,

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,520
I have to agree with that. Patricia, by the way, is someone who always takes a couple sandwiches

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,960
where they're on any trip. Any flight, it doesn't matter what she's doing, she always takes

179
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,760
long a couple of sandwiches with cheese and just stuff that'll keep for a long while and I must say,

180
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,680
many of the time have we enjoyed that sitting in an airport terminal waiting for a flight.

181
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
Before I forget, I don't have a promo for it, but there is another digital

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,080
flotsam that's been released. PW Fenton, who of course produces the pod show on serious and

183
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,600
is quite a wheel within the pod show organization when it comes to pulling out the promos and the

184
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,560
pod cast and the pod safe music and the mashups. Definitely check out his new addition of digital

185
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,800
flotsam. It's a short one. It's like 17 or 18 minutes. It's, uh, what was I think it's titled,

186
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,520
growing up a geek in a society that worships jocks. Any nerd will completely love this episode

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
of digital flotsam. So make sure you check that out at digitalflotsam.org. Of course,

188
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,680
all the links to the show will be included in the show notes for today's podcast at dailysourceco.com

189
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,000
or www.curry.com and then do it in the new format because I'm now using my new favorite outline.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,080
I've always been using frontier or radio user land and I'm the outlineer, which I think is a

191
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,680
Mac only product is really fantastic. It's has so many incredible options and you can output

192
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,800
your outline as dynamic HTML. So my thought is I'm going to get back into the hang of

193
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,920
releasing both the OPML for the show notes as well as inline show notes in outline or format with

194
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,880
nodes expanded and collapsed so you can immediately go to the stuff that you want and if, you know,

195
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,840
or the the top line stuff and if you need anything any additional info just expand the note. I think

196
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,920
I do that with an eye frame. I'm going to have to play around with that a little bit. But that is

197
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,760
all for later. First we have some promos. Welcome to 101 uses for baby wipes. Okay. It's a podcast

198
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,280
about parenting from a dad's point of view. I know that. With your host Dennis Gray. Thanks,

199
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,080
radio and answer Jeff. On the podcast we'll explore news and current events related to parenting

200
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,800
in the internet age. Oh yeah. Lighthearted topics for discussion, some fun guests,

201
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,280
little pod sake music stirred in. And of course a special segment each week featuring things to

202
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,560
do with all those baby wipes you bought at the big box megastore just before your kid finished by training.

203
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,800
To the dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad. My son, he's five. He runs the mixing board for me. So how can I

204
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,760
go wrong? I'm not going to join this red thing. Hope you'll subscribe and listen in as we follow

205
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
a reluctant father's journey through parenthood. You know I'm going to join that red thing.

206
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,000
You can find us on the web at one zero one uses for baby wipes.com. I know that. I know that.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,480
I know that. Thanks for listening everybody. Oh, we're also on the pod safe music network.

208
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Man, I tunes. Thanks, everybody.

209
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Hi, Joe. Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:55,040
Hi, this is MB, the host of Ferry Till Corner. Ferry Till Corner is a new podcast where we feature

211
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,120
classic modern and original fairy tales that are safe for the whole family. Here at Ferry Till Corner,

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,200
share of scary and maybe gruesome events, but it's all good. Only the bad people have bad

214
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,280
stuff happen to them. Things like having your eyes plucked out by pigeons or heels and toes cut off

215
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:29,200
by a knife. So join me in Ferry Till Corner. You can subscribe to the feed at feeds.feedburner.com

217
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:49,760
happen a long time. It was messing around with the outliner. And then I pulled. Shit. I pulled the

218
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
mouth. Oh, there. Oh, I see what happened. Of course. What is that damn thing? All those widgets?

219
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,280
Man, I hate it when that pops up. Okay, let's see if we can get the, uh,

220
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,840
you know, maybe I just rolled that promo out again because that did kind of suck. Hold on.

221
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,400
Let me see. We'll do the the Ferry Till Corner podcast again if you don't mind.

231
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,120
It was you've got mail, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Never seen it before and of course,

232
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,320
the minute you see the movie you know what's going to happen in the end and you still sit there

233
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,840
and watch like a more on. But it was kind of cute. Meg had the little bookstore around the corner

234
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,760
and it was basically a kid's bookstore. I remind of me of that promo. Back to the Gmail bag,

235
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,760
plenty of comments. This is really cool when you do something on a Friday and you wait over the weekend.

236
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,840
The comments just keep rolling in. So last week we talked about the accuracy of the GPS receiver

237
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,000
that I used for a couple of my flights and when the plane was basically stationary it was recording

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
it as if we were bugging on all over within a hundred yard radius of actually where the plane was

239
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:09,920
and I think it was a PW sent in that the US government purposely sends down some kind of

240
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,360
scrambling stuff with the signal. What apparently this is called Selective Availability Dithering.

241
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,400
And I got several emails. I just wanted to share a couple of with you. Here's one from

242
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,520
pilot Mike from the pilot cast. It says you should know that the Selective Availability Dithering

243
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,240
for the GPS signal has been gone since its removal was ordered by President Clinton in 2000.

244
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,480
It has not even been restored in wartime. It goes on to say it's a competing GPS system called

245
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,840
Gaida Leia. I think we've talked about that before, which is being set up by the European Union

246
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,520
specifically. So they have a system where well where the US doesn't have the awesome which.

247
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,360
And then there's another one. Another GPS system called WAS wide area augmentation system

248
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,640
and local WAS where ground-based GPS transmitters and repeaters are being installed to get the

249
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,640
kind of precision needed for precision approaches. A.O.P. that's the aircraft owner's pilot

250
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,560
association president Phil Boyer demonstrated using a new WAS approach at Frederick Maryland

251
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,440
compared it to ILS instrument landing system. You said it was amazing. Okay. So I actually

252
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,640
subscribe to the pilot cast. It's kind of cool. I've been subscribed to a number of aviation

253
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,120
podcasts and some of them just seem to seem to go away or are very very infrequent.

254
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,440
Typical lazy ass pilots, but I'd like the pilot cast. Greg Grusby says kind of the same thing

255
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,160
goes back to a 2000 and the removal of Selective Availability built into the GPS system. He says

256
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,640
by the way and we'll talk about this later. I have purchased original back catalog tracks after hearing

257
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,520
remixes and mashups on the daily source code. He says I'd rather buy my music on iTunes music store

258
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:56,400
than any playsells. Thank you very much Greg. And the final from Robert. Let me see if he says anything.

259
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,400
He said well he says I work with GPS on cell phones all day. I can tell you that your listener

260
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,360
that said commercial GPS is less accurate than military GPS due to induced errors is bullshit.

261
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,080
There we go. And basically the same thing. Selective Availability. So I guess that's called triangulation.

262
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:19,200
We got three people saying that it has not been turned back on. This is kind of interesting.

263
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,720
Military GPS is better because the GPS satellites actually transmit data on two frequencies. Only

264
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,520
one of which is available to commercial GPS receivers. Okay. That's new data. Military units

265
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
listen on both frequencies. The reason for this is that large source of errors caused by

266
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,000
ionospheric interferences in the atmosphere. I think I have that this morning. Just before I

267
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,520
didn't my daily download. And then I was at about smart bombs. Bombs are moving entities. The

268
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,440
last source of GPS errors called multi-path reflection with a GPS single bounces off of objects and

269
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,560
causes the receiver to see duplicates of the signal. Okay. So clearly it's listed a lot of

270
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,880
bits and bytes to be fixed out. But if you're wondering why smart bombs were that email is for you.

271
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:15,440
So also now I'm going back to posting the actual emails into the outline with all the links

272
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,400
and all of that integrity left in there. So hopefully you'd like the new format of the show notes.

273
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
Then I got an email from Wichita, a brother for you probably heard his five minutes with Wichita

274
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,640
podcast. If not, you've got to listen to it. He interviews the biggest stars in country and western

275
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
and bluegrass. And it's only five minutes. And if they say the secret word, then they get the

276
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,040
place them horrible trick on. And it looks like Wichita is reaching out a bit of his email. Why don't

277
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,760
we do this as a podcasting community, podcasts for hurricane victims? Let's all do two to three

278
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
minute podcasts that won't inspire people to give to the red cross or food banks or whatever

279
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,280
organization they choose to help these folks who are going to be without food, water, shelter, clothing,

280
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600
medicine, and Lord knows what all else this thing could get ugly very quick. So if we want to

281
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,840
prepare, we'd be ready to do what we do best to help them. We've got a big infrastructure now

282
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,560
as Wichita with millions of listeners true. Let's put ourselves in our podcast to the side

283
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,400
for a minute and put links to these organizations, whichever ones you choose as the main focus

284
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,160
and links on our sites. Okay, so there's a whole instruction email that he sent and I totally agree.

285
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,800
So I shall do tofully put in some links because we will have victims of the hurricane,

286
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:38,160
not necessarily casualties per se, but just imagine, you know, I've heard reports where

287
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,440
people don't expect to go back to their homes for a month. It's hard to imagine what kind of

288
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,560
devastation could be heading for New Orleans and for Louisiana in general. So God speed to all

289
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,000
and please support your red cross and other organizations that will be on the scene.

290
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,000
A hoi Adam says Caroline, in the daily source code today, this is from last week, you mentioned

291
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
that you hadn't gotten any feedback from teenagers. Yeah, I mean, I was talking about how

292
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,960
what a common bond we have as parents in the podcast where I can, you hear my daughter come in

293
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,680
and hear something she says and people will immediately email and identify with the situation

294
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,480
of the scenario. So Caroline says, here you go, I'm about the same age as Christina,

295
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,920
2015 and a couple months, and speaking as a teenage girl and oldest child, I can tell you that

296
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,520
fathers are no picnic either. Your relationship with her actually reminds me a lot of mine with my

297
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,440
dad and although I love him dearling, he's a hassle. It's just job the knife in. My parents

298
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,560
haven't experienced a child grow up before and it seems to be harder for them to let go of me

299
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,120
than for me to renounce them. Oh, well, gee, I'm sorry, they're Caroline. I guess I didn't

300
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,560
find the manual either. Also worth mentioning, I think, is that in my case, much of the insulin

301
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,760
and rebellion is calculated. We teenagers are smarter than you think. After 15 years of living

302
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,160
under the rule of parents, I love this language. We have learned how to manipulate,

303
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,120
play Kate and annoy you in ways that I don't think you understand or maybe my parents are just

304
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,360
easy. Whatever the reason I think that us capable and intelligent teenage girls are vastly

305
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,920
underrated, I don't really know what Christina is like, but I would bet that she has things much more

306
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,880
under control than you believe. Thanks for your great podcasts. If not for your love of teenagers,

307
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,200
Caroline. Well, that's very nice, very appreciated that you responded. I totally believe that.

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
And Patricia and I were talking about it last night. You know, when I said, well, when you were 15,

309
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,880
what were you doing, what you into? And then she said, and I said, well, yeah, so why would that be

310
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:56,480
any different? I think the thing that's a little bothersome these days is what kids are into and

311
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,000
what's important to them. Now, of course, most of that has to do with commercialism and with

312
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,800
commercial television, I totally believe, but also I was looking through the Vogue today, the latest

313
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,880
edition of Vogue, which is it's thicker than a Bible. It is, of course, the fashion Bible,

314
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,400
but it's thicker than a Bible. And it's all advertisements, which is, and it's a, what a great

315
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,360
gig. I mean, what a fantastic publication. Basically, your advertisers pay for the content because

316
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,240
that's what it is. It is all advertisements with a few bits of editorial thrown in between and by the

317
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,160
way, who cares about the, they've been doing gadgets in the Vogue now as editorial or advertorial

318
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,960
and whatever you call it. So it's really about the, about the pictures and every single one of them

319
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:51,200
is all sexually oriented. Not one is different. It's all women laying down, you know, showing leg.

320
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,320
And it's all beautiful stuff. I totally love it, but, you know, when, when that is what the entire

321
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:04,400
fashion Bible consists of, you know, you got to start expecting kids to be influenced by it.

322
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,000
Turn on MTV. Please turn on MTV and watch it for an hour. And, you know, and people say,

323
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,720
oh, don't watch MTV in the more exciting music videos. They most certainly do. And they're at

324
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,200
very important hours. And go and watch what's going on. It's all about being in the club and being

325
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,880
successful and having the chicks and got, got your cars and got your crib and being back in the club

326
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,600
and it's all about the club and it's about the drinking in the club. And, you know, what do we expect?

327
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,440
Look at the example we're setting. I didn't have those types of examples. Of course, I wish

328
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
I had at the time, but, so we got to provide some balance. I think that's, that's the main thing.

329
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,080
And that's probably balance in viewing habits, which I think we can totally change. I think we can,

330
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,920
you know, I loved it when when I was a kid and they said, your brain's going to rot from television.

331
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,880
It's going to rot away. Don't sit too close. No more than an hour a day. Or your brain will rot away.

332
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,080
You know what? Let me put that in my show notes right now. Time once again to hold on.

333
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:27,040
The Zen TV experiment. If you don't believe me, that the television is bad for your health,

334
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,400
do the Zen TV experiment. I guarantee you you will not be disappointed. Probably about once a month

335
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,240
I pointed out, just read it, take a look at it. Maybe even if you do half of the Zen TV experiment

336
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,560
tonight while you're watching TV, I think you'll understand what's going on with your brain.

337
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,280
I'm Mini Paul and I produce a podcast about minis. Not the shiny new,

338
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,480
but very variety, but the old classic ones which have been around for 45 years. I talk about the

339
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,760
goings on with my own 1966 Morris Mini and all the mini related shows I tend up and down the

340
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,880
90 Kingdom. You can join me at www.miniPaul.co.uk.

341
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:24,240
Hi Adam, this is Al. And Kathy from www.WidVid12.com, the wedding videographer's podcast.

342
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,080
WidVidTalk has 30 shows uploaded with a half dozen more strapped to our belts. You mean recorded

343
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,880
and ready to upload? Yes, Kathy. You know Adam says with 16 million tons of airplane. Oh,

344
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,720
have a mind. Adam, we're fans of the Daily Source Code and we want to wish you a very happy birthday.

345
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,400
Yes Adam, happy birthday. Oh, thank you. Now that's the way to get your promo played,

346
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,520
dammit. And of course Saturday we had Christina's birthday. She turned 15 birthdays are a real

347
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,480
big deal in the Netherlands where people come up and congratulate every member of the family and

348
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,920
they'll say congratulations with your daughter's birthday or your niece's birthday, your granddaughter's

349
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,600
birthday and they always do big decorations and presents and everyone calls all day and people

350
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,080
come drop by and visit. Of course no one can drop by and visit that easily from from

351
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,520
back home, but there were plenty of phone calls and we all slept really late, which was nice.

352
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:27,520
And Christina had a girlfriend stay over and then she invited John out to dinner and she

353
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,760
wanted to have a posh dinner. So we went to cafe de barri and it was great. And they were all grown

354
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:44,480
up and stuff. Friends as Adam letting you know, I'm a Senseo Connoisseur as well.

355
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,920
Hold on, I need to have a little sip while we're talking about it.

356
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
From listening to your show, I discovered this product. I'll tell you this podcasting shit works.

357
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,320
And so last weekend, I took my cash down to a local department store and got one.

358
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,280
And here in Australia, the pods work out to about 33 cents each, so it's cheaper in the long run than

359
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,240
getting takeaway coffees from a cafe. The dark roast pack is quickly becoming my favorite.

360
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,400
It would be good to know what your roast is. What's your preference?

361
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,800
Also, if there is a Senseo or coffee podcast out there somewhere, you know, the agency for Senseo

362
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,080
did call us and I know that of course we responded. I haven't heard anything about it, but you know,

363
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,520
we should really put together a case study with the source code and with Senseo. And what that can

364
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,080
mean to a brand and what it can mean to sales, you know, I don't know what's going on with them.

365
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,400
I'll have to ask KJ, see what's going on. It would be cool. I mean, I've been doing it just for

366
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,440
the love of the product. And I make about, you know, like a hundred, 150 bucks a month on selling

367
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,440
Senseo's and people also click on the Amazon link on curry.com and buy other things through it.

368
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
And we'll be talking about affiliate programs and just a little bit on the source code,

369
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,480
because there's some exciting stuff to share regarding that.

370
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,880
Barstools, I've been, I've said that I needed a barstool after standing on my feet all day

371
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
on Friday Thursday and really noticing that that's not going to work.

372
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,800
So there's a couple of suggestions that came through, I'll post that in the email gray.

373
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,600
I'm actually sent me a link to the bombo barstool. I've received offers from people who sell

374
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,160
barstools and which, of course, I said, yeah, sure. Send me a barstool. I'll promote it on the show.

375
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,320
No problem whatsoever. And Brian, I'm going to say, Sherry or Shiree, Sherry, I think.

376
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,240
Mr. Curry says, that makes me feel so all.

377
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,720
Mr. Curry, love, Delta Sherry, Charlie, got turned on to iPod when stationed in Iraq,

378
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,960
just heard the August 16th show. I love this about podcasting. It's so,

379
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,200
me just says the delivery is a synchronous, so is the listening. And people catch up,

380
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
you know, they listen to old shows and sometimes like, wow, what's this person talking about?

381
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,800
It's something from a show from weeks ago or even months ago.

382
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,800
So this is, this is the August 16th show when I talked about Iraq and the war against Terry.

383
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,080
He says, you've used about the Iraqi people are right on target. I was stationed up a

384
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,480
grime after the scandal broke. Thank you. And most of the detainee prisoner population weren't

385
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,760
Iraqi. Mostly, they were Syrian. After all, how can a group of insurgents galvaned across the

386
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,800
country unfunded? The Iraqi people are so poor. They couldn't fund this type of terrorism. My

387
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,120
thought is that the Syrian government is afraid. They are thinking, first Iraq, then us.

388
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,480
Syrian culture is economically politically and religiously a mirror of that of Iraq.

389
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,000
Just my two cents. That's all. Love the daily source code. I remember you back from the

390
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,560
days when MTV actually played music videos. Well, they played them with different themes

391
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,560
then in the club and cars that bounce up and down. Although, I wouldn't mind having one of those

392
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,160
cars that bounces up and down. I think those are. Those are definitely kind of cool.

393
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:02,320
Yeah, so Syria, huh? Yeah, I would believe that without a doubt. I mean, I think it was it now

394
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,920
officially proven or not that the Syria was responsible for Pan M flight 103.

395
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,960
And, of course, that's going to be interesting because Tony Blair, we didn't

396
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:19,360
we see him just a few months back, make a nice to, um, good doffy. That's his name, right?

397
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:27,040
Or is that Libya? Fuck, man. Syria, Libya. Jesus. Okay. I think I have to go

398
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:35,120
polish up a little bit on my geography. The obtuse angle. Steve DuPont dot com.

399
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:43,760
Now, say, tone, minus Gary, do you see? It's cool. It's not what? Who is why?

400
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,880
Holy moly, that's pretty good. Uh, can you argue that the fact that the trees are made of dirt?

401
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,120
An air?

402
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:03,120
Is a lightning bolt air tight? In terms of just being a show.

403
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:11,760
Now that's funny. The obtuse angle. Steve DuPont dot com.

404
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,640
All right. Time for some pod save music now on the source code.

405
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,440
Some different that I picked up from the pod save music network. The bit of reggae.

406
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:32,640
There's a beast from the east. No one can tame him. There is a child running wild.

407
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,920
No one can name him. I remember what the club I said.

408
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,440
Yeah, yeah. Thank you for more days. You must be a topi.

409
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Topi. Topi. Yeah. Don't know, not topi.

410
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,840
Shut your try. Plus all the wild. There's a flower, huh, she said the, huh.

411
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,400
Yes, that's the, huh. Yeah. Always the love.

412
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it's a love, it

413
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,260
takes my breath open um we're just keeping your wall

414
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,680
keeping the bond

415
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,080
then nothing, nothing will break my heart

416
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,040
I say it's the air

417
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,200
Cause I'm saying now I see what I'm telling you

418
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,040
Tell me

419
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,160
Tell me

420
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,840
Tell me

421
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,180
air

422
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,100
But don't matter what it's a scam

423
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Look around chimes, she said love, yes there's love, well, always alone, always alone,

424
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:25,100
yeah, always love, always love, always, always, still remember what that could not forget.

425
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Who makes my heart not to happen to yet?

426
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll come up with you that's not my taste though.

427
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Take my breath away just keep in your want.

428
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Even you know, but I remember what they kind of must say.

429
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Back in the morning, didn't you know, she would have told me, you know, don't tell me, she said tell me.

431
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Yeah, we're gonna talk like you don't try, you know, you're the smile from love, she said love,

432
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:15,500
I guess there's love to be up all the way from all the way

433
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:25,640
Always, always, yeah I always love always love always

434
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:37,500
I love and love always love always love always love always love always love always love always love

435
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,600
All in Love

436
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,360
Scott Church and always love discovered on the Podsafe Music Network

437
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,720
Podsafe Music Network.com. The place where artists and podcasters come together

438
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,440
so you can get Podsafe Music you are allowed to play on your podcast and of

439
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,400
course point them back to the artist site and the circle and the loop is then

440
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,840
thereby closed. We're near in our 35 minute mark talking about biodiesel and now

441
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,800
with the price of oil, 70 bucks a barrel and we have established that this of course

442
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,120
is supply and demand and you know demand is just big and supply is just dwindling and

443
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,080
now the Gulf production is closed 650 million barrels a day that won't be

444
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,880
produced so we're getting a lot lower and dipping into the reserves and I've

445
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,880
heard a lot about biodiesel I've read a lot about it it apparently is more

446
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,240
expensive than regular diesel but you can basically grow your own fuel and wouldn't

447
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,600
work for a lot of farmers in the United States and then I get a couple of

448
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,880
couple of emails the first one from Jurgen Schlunt from Germany atom and you last

449
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,240
daily source code you mentioned to buy a diesel and use biodiesel don't do that

450
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,280
now he says it's cheaper than normal diesel I don't think so because you shouldn't do that

451
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,120
here's why biodiesel is a synthetic product made out of rapeseed and methanol okay

452
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,360
I thought you could just take a crap and it would basically make your car run

453
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,720
although the molecular structure is similar to diesel it may damage your engine

454
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,880
diesel fuel may out of oil has a lot of lubrication capabilities for the special injection

455
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,440
and pump parts of it oh okay so this is a good point actually you don't just want to buy

456
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,080
any old diesel and throw it in there that I know is is true

457
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,080
he even says Volkswagen does not approve their current diesels for biodiesel the old ones are

458
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,960
approved though so maybe just buy an old car it goes on and says there's huge German diesel

459
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,400
community on the internet with these topics I'll discuss very contrary but most of the young

460
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,840
most of the people agree to my opinion that is not worth saving 10 or 15 cents for a leader of biodiesel

461
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,360
I know it's to me it's not about the price I mean the price is expensive I mean I have the Audi A8

462
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:01,400
4.2 liter you have no idea Jesus Christ we went flying just the other day it was like 350 pounds

463
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,360
to fill up the plane I mean who am I to complain right but I do remember a very different time so

464
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm not too worried about a little bit of extra money but if it's going to you know

465
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,920
in the long run if it's going to ensure us of a fuel option to keep cars and and there lots of

466
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,880
planes by the way with diesel engines and even helicopters these days and I'm all for it

467
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,920
and I'm seriously considering getting as something that will accept biodiesel I think it's a

468
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,560
it's a lot more friendly yeah we grow our own fuel and inclusive for S Pen I wonder if he's

469
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,760
related to or if he is Sean Branden's brother forget biodiesel check out bio heat for home heating

470
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,120
eliminating another avenue of fossil fuels and he put a couple of links in there to bossen.com so

471
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:55,240
you can find that in the show notes at the A's podcast and then finally buying from iTunes after

472
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:01,400
hearing a mashup or a hit test at least on the daily source code lots of email about that I was

473
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,640
overwhelmed just a quick step Paul Stringer says to random notorious purchased spurships literally

474
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:15,000
about 10 seconds after hearing the mashup mark cats I frequently purchase songs on iTunes after

475
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,280
having heard them on daily source code in the hit test great to hear that music in the memories

476
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,040
it rekindles congratulations Paul I'm a heart surgeon enrichment virginia I'm likely older than

477
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,800
your average listener if I can be a resistance from the standpoint of medical information

478
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,720
in your continued progress promoting podcast and peace field of contact me oh mark hey mark

479
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:41,480
let's do a podcast you know what let's do a heart podcast Patricia has has a bilateral artery

480
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:48,280
that is clogged and I'll ask her if she is any questions you bet you and you know we'd love to get

481
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,760
more medical professionals in the podcasting I mean there's such a wealth of information to be given

482
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,920
out and it could also be good for business I guess Antonio Rosario Adam thought you let you know

483
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,600
that after listening to the hit test on your latest podcast I too went to the iTunes music store

484
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,160
and bought earth wind and fires fantasy while I was there I picked up four more of their songs

485
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,400
that I was surprised they did not have my collection yet so hell yeah the hit test sells songs

486
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:21,080
see let's see do I have more I got I'd have so many um and my new system is working

487
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,920
Adam I've purchased four songs from iTunes after hearing them in mashups you're right it's a

488
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,560
great way to promote back catalog I hadn't thought about rock steady by Arita Franklin for years

489
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,160
her to snippet in a mashup went to iTunes downloaded it dragged my eye pod done and then there's a

490
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:42,120
little plug in there for the chub creek pod cast this is this is really phenomenal I mean if this is

491
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,080
just the the people that felt they should respond then the percentage of people actually buying

492
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:53,560
back catalog through iTunes after hearing a mashup or after hearing a hit test I think is fairly

493
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,640
sizable Kevin Crossman won't even further yet purchased to Rob Costlo tracks and Stevie Wonder

494
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,720
superstition after hearing booty booty what is booty station that was a mashup also downloaded

495
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,400
lots of mashups and pod safe tracks that you play you know the kind of stuff you can't purchase

496
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,720
even if you wanted to would happily happily happily purchase mashups if I could I think that

497
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,120
we've got something here I really do if these mashups are actually enticing people to buy the original

498
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,880
tracks that's fantastic unfortunately I'm in our Australia says Brett Rand don't have much option

499
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,040
for buying music online I think there's a couple but it's windows media player DRM stuff and we're

500
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,240
100% Mac house so that's a that's a barmer he says I'm looking for earth winded fire fantasy love that song

501
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,640
okay so he would do it if he could I didn't know that the I thought that iTunes music store was pretty good

502
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,120
in Australia apparently not and Frank Hurfs finally referring to hit test driving track sales

503
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,720
question yes I have bought a lot of music for my teams after listening to the daily source code

504
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,720
main reason that I did it after hit test and night years before simple I didn't know the

505
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,520
name of the band of the song young plays a lot of great songs from the 70s the time when I grew up

506
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,640
I've always liked this music but it's too young to keep in mind the artists when they were at the

507
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,040
crest of their fame 30 years later I hear these great songs again but today there's a big difference

508
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,840
you and young can tell everyone from whom the music is and and that's fantastic with this knowledge

509
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,720
iTunes helps me find what I'm looking for and usually it takes only a few minutes until the song is mine

510
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:27,000
and this is a big thing that we talk about it pod show it it appears that so many people are driving

511
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,840
pod casting and music sales with text you know where's all the music where are all the shows that

512
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,720
how women like the source code you know we've got to have many other shows of people driving

513
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,720
you to places and as you can tell it works the hit test sells back catalog

514
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:52,600
podcasting with battery I suppose you think you know when you use it yes I know what do you

515
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,400
test young bollet

516
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,480

532
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,720

Answer number two, Chris Ria.

534
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720

Oh yeah. Also, something from 86.

And high above.

544
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Really great song to end up this. It has number 52.

545
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
Well, that's it.

546
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I'm going to trim this file to get rid of the silence at the beginning and at the end.

547
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,720
And as soon as I can, I'll try to upload it to the server.

548
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,720
Well, it's always two addresses.

549
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,720
Hit us at gmail.com for feedback and young.lid.com.

550
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,720
J-A-N-P-L-E-T.com for information about the hit us and the hit us podcast.

551
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Okay. Well, this is the first for me recording the hit us on a train.

552
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,720
Hopefully it's not fine.

553
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,720
And it's good enough to upload it to the server.

554
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Okay. We'll see you next time for 53.

555
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,720
So until then, bye-bye.

556
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,720
All right. Young for that.

557
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,720
Selling back catalog faster than a speeding bagel.

558
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
With the hit test.

559
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Thank you very much.

560
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,720
Y'all love that cast blaster on the train.

561
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,720
Work perfectly.

562
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
And Y'all has some great news.

563
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,720
You should check out his weblog at youngpolet.com.

564
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
He's got some great things going on.

565
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,720
He's starting up a radio school, a broadcasting and podcasting school

566
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,720
in the Netherlands under the auspices of Veronica Radio.

567
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,720
So that's very cool and very happy for him.

568
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,720
And part of that basically came through the podcast.

569
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,720
So you go, you've worked out.

570
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,720
And I think Y'all is going to be spawning a whole bunch of great new podcasts

571
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
from the Netherlands.

572
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
Very, very soon.

573
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,720
And for now, it's time for me to cut out of here.

574
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
What are we at?

575
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
46 minutes.

576
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Bit long.

577
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,720
It's a daily source code for Monday, August 29, 2005.

578
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,720
And I plan on having a show every day this week

579
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,720
because production has lightened up a little bit

580
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,720
and everything's all kind of squared away.

581
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,720
So I can get into my email.

582
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,720
And of course, I got that new outlining system.

583
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
I'm so happy with it.

584
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,720
Totally enticing when it comes to setting up a show, putting it together.

585
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,720
So I'll be hopefully setting this up with an eye frame.

586
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
So you can easily access it in the show notes.

587
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720
I have no idea how that's going to work out.

588
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,720
We'll find out.

589
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,720
And thank you very much for subscribing to the daily source code.

590
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,720
You can find the podcast feed at dailysourcecode.com.

591
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Just search for Adam Curry or daily source code in iTunes.

592
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,720
That's probably one of the easiest ways to subscribe to podcasts

593
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,720
and to find them.

594
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,720
And of course, this is my weblog at www.curry.com

595
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,720
for comments and feedbacks and show notes.

596
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,720
Feedbacks.

597
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Feedback of course.

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,720
Adam at Curry.com, please.

599
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,720
If you're going to send me all your feedback,

600
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,720
stick it up on a server somewhere

601
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,720
and just send me the link.

602
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
Alright, I appreciate that.

603
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,720
And if you've got a promo to submit, send it off to submit at podshow.com.

604
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,720
And I'll put it through the funnel.

605
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,720
We get into the podshow on serious.

606
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,720
We can get stuff into the pod finder on iTunes

607
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,720
and eventually find its way into the daily source code.

608
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,720
I'll talk to you, everybody.

609
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Thank you very much for listening.

610
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,720
Stay subscribed.

611
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,720
Bye-bye.

612
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:41,720
One other podshow podcast.

613
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,720
Stick it in your ear.
