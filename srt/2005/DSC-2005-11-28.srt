1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta, Sierra Charney, 2-80-7!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are no secrets.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Only information you don't get higher.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Korean.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The next generation radio concert in my ears.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm sighing into this genre.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It balls you and Madalemy should.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good morning, Madalemy.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's Monday.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Start of a new week.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're getting very close to the holiday season.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Which means it's time to start cranking up the Christmas tunes.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Checking out the pot-safe music network over the weekend.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not the only one with these thoughts about Christmas songs.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not the only one wanting something different,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
something new to celebrate the holiday season.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Jill Park is on my frequency.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you hear what I hear?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Check this out.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Cool.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Do you hear what I hear?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you hear what I hear?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you hear what I hear?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you hear what I hear?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you hear what I hear?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you hear what I hear?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do you hear what I hear?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you hear what I hear?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you hear what I hear?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you hear what I hear?

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you hear what I hear?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do you hear what I hear?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Do you hear what I hear?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you hear what I hear?

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you hear what I hear?

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you hear what I hear?

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you hear what I hear?

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you hear what I hear?

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you hear what I hear?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Do you hear what I hear?

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you hear what I hear?

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you hear what I hear?

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you hear what I hear?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you know where I am?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're through the sky, shall we go?

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you know where I am?

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, a sun, the sun,

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I am at the sea with a voice

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As big as the sea, with a voice

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
As big as the sun, yeah

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, a sun,

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am at the sea with a voice

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do you know where I am?

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, a sun, the sun, yeah

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In the clouds warm my head

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you know where I am?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hey, how's it going?

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's the sun, the sun, the sun

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's be your sun, the sun

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, a sun, the sun, yeah

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, a sun, yeah

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, a sun, the sun, yeah

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We're through the sky, shall we go?

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Do you know where I am?

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, a sun, the sun, yeah

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In the clouds warm my head

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,400
To the people of the way

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,920
How it sends you and I say

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,880
Before peace, people of the way

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,080
Oh, it sends you and I say

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,280
Hey, you shine the shine

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,720
He's giving it the power

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,720
He's giving it the power

77
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Hey, you shine the shine

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,720
He's giving it the power

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,720
He's giving it the power

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:54,720
He's giving it the power

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,720
He's giving it the power

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,720
He's giving it the power

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:16,720
He's giving it the power

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,720
He's giving it the power

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
How much asked does that kick?

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Jill Park, do you hear what I hear?

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I hear the quintessential Christmas song

88
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
From the pod save music network

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
We'll be talking a lot about that today

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Good morning, good afternoon

91
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Good evening, wherever you're from

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
It is indeed nearing the Christmas season

93
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,720
The high street lights have been illuminated

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
In the high street and gilford

95
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
And starting today, I hope

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I still have to win on confirmation of the setup

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
We'll have a new feed, a new podcast

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Feeders, you can find at xmus.podshow.com

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Every day I'll be unleashing a new pod save Christmas song

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
And I was thinking about this last night

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
So basically I want the concept here

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Is to release a new Christmas song from the pod save music network

103
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Every single day, put it into this feed

104
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
So you can essentially just use it to fill up your iPod

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
And at the end, I'll make sure that we have the full complete feed

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
With all songs that will probably be what

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
25 or something, no

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Almost 30 songs

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,720
I'll re-publish that so it'll be like an archive

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Now it would be

111
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I think it would be too

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,720
You know what, I'm really thinking of the radio stations that you hear

113
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
The during Christmas time

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,720
They send all the disjockeys home and they just play Christmas music

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Which is really nice, although it's extremely repetitive

116
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Often

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,720
But you can just kind of turn it on and you'll have a nice little Christmas vibe

118
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
So I'd like to give you some stuff to fill up your iPods

119
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
And you don't need to play with for Christmas vibe

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
And what I'm looking for is Christmas greetings short, please

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Very short Christmas greetings from podcasters

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
And podsafe musicians as well

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
So I can mix those over the intros

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
And so when you play it back to back

125
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
It'll be like this nice, big long holiday greeting card

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
So if you feel like doing that, drop it into promos.podshow.com

127
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Drop your Christmas greeting in there

128
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Just a very generic high

129
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
It's selling so from the so and so podcast

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Merry Christmas

131
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Or any other holiday message you wish to convey

132
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,720
So look for that, Xmas.podshow.com

133
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
The same request, they went out simultaneously

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
For podsafe the queen.podshow.com

135
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Christina's getting really serious now

136
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
About, about coma second

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Just I'm still frigging around with this microphone

138
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,720
It's too good for the board, that's my problem

139
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
So Christina's podcast

140
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
I have a feeling that what she's going to do is

141
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,720
She's going to want to work on the look and feel of her

142
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Show site first before she does the actual podcast

143
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
But she was even out last night

144
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Or yesterday afternoon she came around home before

145
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
7, of course

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,720
At a local rehearsal slash recording

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Soundstage with some local emo kids

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
She said we're rocking out

149
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
She says that she's going to get an MP3

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
From them, played on the show

151
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
So she's really, she's into it

152
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm excited too

153
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
It's fun to work with kids like that

154
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Because of course I'll be doing all the engineering

155
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
By special request

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Last week we talked about free talk live

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
And how someone had questioned whether they're

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Calling for podcast Ali votes on their radio show

159
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
If that was fair play or not

160
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
So we talked about that in In Bernard of the show

161
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Rode and give some feedback

162
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
It says in regards to your question about our radio

163
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Listenership, actually our week, this is the good thing

164
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
I really love this

165
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Our weekday radio audience is likely smaller than our podcast audience

166
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Though our Saturday show has now over 10 radio affiliates

167
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Plus to address your email is concerned

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
The nature of radio listeners precludes most of them

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
From voting for us

170
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Most of them are in the car, which is the last place

171
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
They're likely to visit our vote page

172
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I disagree with that

173
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Oh boy do I disagree

174
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I think lots of people are listening in the car

175
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Whether it's on the radio or on a podcast

176
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
And they just remember they go home and they vote

177
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
This is kind of the cool thing

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Is if you have an RSS feed of your show notes

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Eventually that will combine someone's field of vision

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
That's the way it's supposed to work or kind of

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
And then they'll say oh yeah that's right

182
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I'm in browsing mode no I might go over and vote

183
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Nonetheless your email seems to be missing the point

184
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,720
We do call votes from other sources beyond podcast listeners

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
That's good for podcasting

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
That's why we have a trade deal with podcast Ali

187
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Because talking about podcasting on the radio can only help podcasting

188
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Not hurt

189
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Similarly driving listeners to vote

190
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Also increases their chance of poking around podcast

191
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Ali and sampling other shows

192
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Oh you know what I totally agree

193
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,720
I think it's fair no matter how you do it

194
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
You know that's what growing an audience is all about

195
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Jeez look at what some people on TV will do to get an audience

196
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
This is all stuff from last week

197
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
I had an note here to talk about

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,720
What was this more iTunes problems Allen says

199
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Doesn't necessarily have to do with podcast

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
And listening to daily source code 285

201
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
And you just talked about the iTunes music store problem

202
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I've been receiving errors that say

203
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Quote credit card processing is temporarily unavailable

204
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
You may continue to browse the store

205
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Please try to make your purchase later

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Allen goes on to say I think I'll send an email

207
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
To the iTunes support team to see what they have

208
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
And response but I'm thinking the same thing

209
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
They must be losing a lot of sales

210
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Well of course they're losing sales

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
And I'm sure that they're not happy about it

212
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Yeah and I want to

213
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I didn't really have the time to respond

214
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
In great depth about

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Mads Weinstein's issues with iTunes

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
But I just want to reiterate

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
That you know iTunes is not the be all and end all of podcasting

218
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Nor do I think what we're doing right now is the end all and the be all of the end of the be all

219
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Of what podcasting can do

220
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,720
And I think you know look we we fought against

221
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Everything and also corporate radio look how far we've gotten there

222
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Now let's not let's not put our dependency on iTunes

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Or any other company for that reason

224
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Not pod show not Microsoft not iTunes not Google

225
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
There's something much bigger going on here

226
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
And good stuff

227
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Stop well let's just say stuff that people want to hear

228
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
They find it that that's the beautiful thing about the internet

229
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Is it just does kind of work

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Of course you can always take out some television ads

231
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720
That'll be better than iTunes trust me

232
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Maybe a little bit more expensive

233
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,720
I think it was two trips ago to San Francisco

234
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Where I played what was I guess is the first orgasm fed by RSS

235
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,720
From the horror cast

236
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,720
The Sacred Horror host of the horror cast

237
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Michael Butler rock and roll geek show you might want to check out his latest episode

238
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,720
He doesn't interview with her and talks about the sex industry and sex workers

239
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
The Michael's quite an interviewer

240
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,720
He's really I'm not just impressed

241
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm often humbled by how he gets his interviews to really open up

242
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
And talk to him about all this amazing stuff

243
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
So you may want to check that out

244
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
I didn't pull a sound clip from it

245
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
It's all good trust me it's all good

246
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,720
And boy does the Sacred Horror have a sexy voice

247
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Oh my goodness

248
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Brand

249
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Hey Adam

250
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I mean this and you talk about crazy people

251
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Which is a movie I absolutely love

252
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I thought of another movie that's been floating around the net for a while

253
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Called Truth and Advertising

254
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Oh that's right

255
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Oh yeah, I actually had some audio feedback that I wanted to share

256
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Here listen to this

257
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Hey Adam this is a brand

258
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
And I hope you're having a wonderful Thanksgiving

259
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I do the journey to the center of dot com podcast with my buddy Steven

260
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Both of us actually work for an advertising company

261
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,720
I've been listening to you lately talk about crazy people

262
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Which I think is a fantastic movie

263
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,720
That is one of my all-time comedy classics

264
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,720
And I just every time I see certain products like jaguars

265
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
And stuff like that I think about

266
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
The tag lines and things from that movie

267
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
But I thought there's also a movie that's been floating around the net

268
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
That you may not have seen

269
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
And that's called Truth and Advertising

270
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
That's just a spot on parody

271
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Of what it's like

272
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,720
See working and advertising for some of the craziness that goes on

273
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
I put a link in the email that I sent to you

274
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
But if you do end up spending this on the DSC

275
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Then I'll go over and put it in the show notes

276
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Everybody else can check it out

277
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
It's pretty funny stuff

278
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
So anyway, thanks for listening

279
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Keep up the good work on the DSC

280
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,720
And if you ever want to hear intellectually stimulating right left talk

281
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Without the acrimonious

282
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Invective or partisan hackery

283
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Come check us out

284
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
At journey to the center of dot com

285
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Thanks

286
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Thanks Brent, appreciate it

287
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
And in fact after this show

288
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
The minute I'm done while I'm still uploading

289
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
I'm off to go get my hand jobs from women I hardly know

290
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
The cruiser is ready

291
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
The money has arrived

292
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Everything is taken care of

293
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I can go pick it up

294
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I love that movie you sent me

295
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Let's see if it works in audio only

296
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
And please do I love that

297
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Self perpetuating show notes

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
So you'll put the link in

299
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Let's see if it works if we just listen to this

300
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
It's basically a series of conference rooms

301
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
It's imagine Boston legal

302
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
That type of office

303
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Those type of conference rooms

304
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,720
And then imagine advertising people

305
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
We've talked about fan

306
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
We've talked about having sex with

307
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Oh

308
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh, hi time

309
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm just interrupting to instill some fear

310
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
And to humiliate Bob here

311
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Okay

312
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I would say John well here

313
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Can I pop by your office

314
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Say around fiveish to kiss your ass

315
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Sure

316
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Bill, do you want to shut your tongue up my ass

317
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
And give it a few tools?

318
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Absolutely

319
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
I give you a hand job in a stationary closet

320
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
If it meant a good review

321
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Great

322
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Well carry on you over paid jackasses

323
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Go to hell

324
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Well

325
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Sorry to be the mean in front of you

326
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
As I was saying

327
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I've tried to come as many ideas as I can

328
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Into this brief

329
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Because I'm really too weak

330
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
And too stupid

331
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
To make a decision

332
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
So let me ask a question

333
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
In order to give the illusion

334
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
That I actually give a shit

335
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Yeah

336
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
What we're trying to communicate

337
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
We hear really is near

338
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Pairty performance

339
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Right

340
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Okay

341
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Now this is a term that is used as a blatant attempt

342
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
To mislead consumers

343
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Because we're really too cheap to improve our products

344
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
For me lish

345
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Yes we are

346
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,720
So Bob I'm trying to act like I'm making a contribution

347
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
When clearly my role is

348
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
It'll find it unnecessary

349
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
No no that sounds good for a catcher

350
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Awkward

351
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Uncomfortable drink with the client

352
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Anyone?

353
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I'd love to

354
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
But I have to go snorkel

355
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
K enough strippers tips

356
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Thanks

357
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
But I'd rather be burned alive

358
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Here comes the pitch by the director

359
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Basically I doubt the best approach

360
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Would be to repeat exactly what you told me

361
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
The first call

362
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
And shout all the words around the bed

363
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Wow

364
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
If I wasn't such a fucking hack

365
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I'd present that thinly veiled cow

366
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Telling

367
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Do anything original to say it all?

368
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Original

369
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
No

370
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
But I will make references to German expression

371
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Ism

372
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Use meaning as terms like edgy

373
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
And suggest

374
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Disgustingly overused blue green transfer look

375
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I wouldn't have mentioned swing until lenses

376
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
But I just discovered they went out for years ago

377
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Okay

378
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
That sounds

379
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Incomprehensible

380
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm going to suggest the change to the treatment

381
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
To confirm your degree of spinal stress

382
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I'll agree to that change

383
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Ignore once I get the job

384
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
So you will be our puppet

385
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Sure for the most part

386
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Just as long as you allow me to illusion of being in control

387
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
And serve the hack failed filmmaker that I am

388
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Great

389
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Well

390
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
To be fun producing this way

391
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
On our culture now

392
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I look forward to sleeping with you

393
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I look forward to sleeping with you

394
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Yeah me too

395
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I hope that worked for you

396
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
You really got to see the video

397
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
It was extremely well acted

398
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
And it is so precisely

399
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
It's a fantastic translation of what really goes on

400
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
In the advertising business

401
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
In the advertising agencies

402
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
When the clients are involved

403
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
And the directors involved

404
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
It's

405
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh my goodness

406
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
It's spot on really

407
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
And the more I think about it

408
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
The more I'm liking this whole honesty thing

409
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I really am

410
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm liking the honesty about the products

411
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
This crazy people had made us laugh

412
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I mean we're still in over this movie

413
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
What 30 years after it was made

414
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
There's something there

415
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
What about you, PD Love

416
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
He had him PD Love with Lovehouse radio

417
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Just a couple comments

418
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
One on advertising

419
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I am getting used to the commercial advertising

420
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
That you're running

421
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
But it was really a big fan of the more subtle

422
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
advertising

423
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
In fact it's a night watching

424
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Lost on TV

425
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
They had us in CO

426
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
And I was waiting for the nice looking lady

427
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
To burp

428
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
During the advertisement

429
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
But that never happened

430
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
But getting used to the new stuff

431
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Still like the old stuff

432
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Also on the topic of pod show

433
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
When can we expect some damn announcements

434
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Very eager and anxious for

435
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Learning a little more about that

436
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
About the pod show delivery network

437
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Or PDN or whatever you're calling it

438
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
But interested in getting some more information on that

439
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
So if you have a time frame

440
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Please share it with us

441
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Let us know

442
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
And I'd be very interested in getting Lovehouse radio on board

443
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
So if it's anything like the pod safe music network

444
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
You definitely got to hit on your hand

445
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
So I love the pod safe

446
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Love the PMM

447
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
And we'd like to see the PDN

448
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Again thanks for everything

449
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
And talk to you

450
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Yeah right I'm PD Love

451
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Well it looks like

452
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
A lot of changes will be incorporated

453
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
By Christmas time for the pod safe music network

454
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
You know we're working on there

455
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
We want to go to sales

456
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
And of course the unlabel will come along with that

457
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
That'll be around

458
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Just after the first of the year

459
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
We have a separate group working on the pod cast

460
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Delivery network the PDN

461
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
And the first invites

462
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,720
I think about today

463
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Or this week

464
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
To get people

465
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
The first batch in

466
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
These are people that we've already talked to

467
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I mean

468
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
When you set up a service

469
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Which is which incorporates a lot more than just a technology

470
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
There's a lot of the promotions

471
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
The marketing

472
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Audience growth

473
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Sales

474
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
All that stuff is in there

475
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
You know you got to start slow

476
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
You kind of make sure you do things right

477
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
And you need the right people to help you with feedback

478
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
So we try to get a good cross section to pod cast

479
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
So it's all on the way

480
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I don't know if we'll have a lot of Christmas gifts

481
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
But certainly by the new year

482
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
When one stuff will really be up and rolling

483
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm very excited

484
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
We're working

485
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Very hard

486
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
And we've actually become

487
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
A much tighter knit group

488
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I don't know what it is

489
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
But this last visit that I had

490
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I just felt like

491
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Everyone's kind of slipping into place there

492
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
And it's feeling it's feeling pretty good

493
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
The vitra

494
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Viagra

495
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
See you

496
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
We find it's a whole studio

497
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
We find it's a whole studio

498
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
We find it's a whole studio

499
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
We find it's a whole studio

500
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:01,720
If this load of shit is what your inbox sounds like

When I said a pod father

514
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
I come to you one of this day

515
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
To ask you a favor

516
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
I am a lowly podcaster

517
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
I have a family podcaster

518
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I do with my wife and my four bambini

519
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
And my children

520
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,720
We have had a trouble getting the people

521
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
To listen to our show

522
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Pod father

523
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
We are at this advantage

524
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,720
We have the children on our show

525
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
We are directed

526
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
We do not swear

527
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
We do not talk about it this eggs

528
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,720
How are we to compete with the bigger podcast

529
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
That have the little red

530
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Explicit logo next to their name

531
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,720
They are so popular

532
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,720
The listeners lack it to hear about this eggs

533
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
No

534
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
They lack it to hear the F word

535
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Pod father

536
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,720
We cannot offer that on our show

537
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,720
If I am a friendly podcast

555
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
No

556
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
With your help pod father

557
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Those are people who will find our show

558
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,720
We are the 6620 West Kidcast

559
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,720
You will find us in iTunes by searching for 6620 West

560
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I do not see a pod father

561
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
I do not see

562
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
My son

563
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I had big plans about creating this whole response to that

564
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Hey

565
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
You know what I am missing?

566
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
I am missing

567
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Yeah

568
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
That is what I am missing

569
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
So I had this whole

570
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
This whole plan

571
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,720
And then I got busy with something else

572
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
No worries

573
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
I think that

574
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
That is too much

575
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,720
I have really been considering a whole new setup here

576
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
This is pissing me off the way this thing works

577
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
It is not flexible enough

578
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I want something

579
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
The mobile setup I am happy with

580
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
But you know this Yamaha workstation

581
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
It is still not exactly what I want

582
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
So I am going to start rethinking that

583
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Somewhere next year I am going to rebuild the whole

584
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Podcast complex

585
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
But anyway

586
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
In the new year my son

587
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
In the new year

588
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Is when we will take care of all of your problems in your requests

589
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I will make you enough for you

590
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Cannot refuse

591
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
We have been talking about

592
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Ask at BMI and their stance on podcasting

593
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Versus

594
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
And really the the issue of copyrights

595
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
That you sign over to them or assign them

596
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
And I have gotten lots of feedback

597
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
We heard about the Dutch Buma Stemera

598
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
We heard about the German Gema

599
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
And now

600
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
You are not going to believe this

601
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
This is exactly what I was

602
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
I joked about this happening

603
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I fucking joked about it

604
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
And it is not happening in the US

605
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,720
But listen to what is going on in the rest of the world

606
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
ERO

607
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
And ERO is from

608
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Oh

609
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
Where is ERO from Finland

610
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Adam if you think that Gema

611
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Is strict on secondary rights and stuff like that

612
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
You should come to Finland and see Tiosto

613
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Which is the Finnish version of Ask at BMI Tiosto

614
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Tango Echo Oscars here at Tango Oscar

615
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Let me give you a few examples how they make things hard on artists

616
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
We made a promo CD with my band a month later

617
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
They sent me a letter that's Tiosto

618
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
With this humongous form I had to fill out

619
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Just to make sure the material on the album was made by us

620
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
And I had to send the one copy of that CD

621
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
So they can check it out and make sure of that

622
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Okay

623
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Well it depends on if you burn the CD at home

624
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Or if you burn it a factory

625
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
If you do it a factory

626
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
There's like automatic processes that go into place there

627
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
So that may have been what happened

628
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
Two

629
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
We played a gig at a local bar

630
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
We alone arranged the whole happening

631
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Which featured lots of local bands and stuff like that

632
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
All the bands played their own material

633
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,720
And we divided the income from ticket sales equally to all bands

634
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Then six months later Tiosto sends me a letter again

635
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
With this gigantic form

636
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Which I of course had to fill out

637
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
They asked which songs we played there

638
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Not just my band but of all bands

639
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
They said that all the bands played their own copyright material

640
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
But that wasn't enough

641
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
We had to pay them for playing our own stuff in there

642
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Point three

643
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,720
If I make a podcast I can't ask any rights from any band to play their music

644
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
If they've copyrighted their music with Tiosto

645
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Even if you make a compilation and give all the profit to charity

646
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,720
You have to pay Tiosto their share

647
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Which of course is sent back to the artist

648
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Which in most cases send the money to the charity organization

649
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
In a nutshell

650
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Tiosto sucks ass

651
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,720
That's a fine finish expression there

652
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
If you want some income from your music

653
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
You had to sign up with Tiosto

654
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,720
But that makes it impossible for you to promote your music for free

655
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Now my band doesn't have any more anything

656
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Any more anything to do with Tiosto

657
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
But we still need to fill a form now and then

658
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Okay, so essentially what is happening here

659
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
With the European rights organizations

660
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
And so far we know it's the same

661
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Also it's for the Dutch, the Germans and the French

662
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
When you sign up with their version of ASCAP BMI

663
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,720
You are not allowed to give away any other rights to anyone

664
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
So you cannot say to a podcaster

665
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Hey go ahead take my stuff and go and play it for free

666
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
That will be a breach of your contract with that rights organization

667
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
This is fucking nuts

668
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
It's really nuts

669
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,720
So you know it's like a it's a conundrum I guess

670
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Or yeah or the catch 22

671
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
No, it's a conundrum I think

672
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
And this is weird

673
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
So I feel you know that we need to address this issue

674
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
I'm not quite sure is there one central organization

675
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
I didn't find it I didn't find one central organization

676
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,720
That that works across all of these rights organizations

677
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
But this is wrong

678
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I mean if it's your property then you should be able to change that license

679
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,720
However you want I think I recall properly that somewhere

680
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,720
It is a constitutional right of these

681
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Of these organizations to be the only one to collect or not collect I guess

682
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
On artists copyright royalties

683
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
It's

684
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
It's fucking nuts

685
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
It's what it is

686
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Hey Adam I recently started the Buckeye Drive Time podcast

687
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
The format is very simple three pod save songs and three promos

688
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
With all of the introductions up front

689
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
And links to the music on the website

690
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,720
When you introduce the promo deal on pod show

691
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
I was deleted

692
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Now I didn't have to run around all over the place looking for promos

693
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Unfortunately many of them are geared towards your daily source code show audience only

694
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
With like a high atom or some other

695
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,720
VSC specific content in the promo

696
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,720
It would be great if folks could provide a generic promo as well

697
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,720
So that I could go ahead and insert them into the show more easily

698
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,720
I genuinely want to promote pod cast and the show promos are the best way that I know about getting it done

699
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Great job with the pod safe music by the way

700
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Music.potshow.com is just absolutely what I needed to be able to get this started

701
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,720
So it got me up and run it and I hope to get to your promos

702
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
And as I can put one together for my own show

703
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
In the meantime, shameless promo number one is

Open to the soul

713
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Oh, our sugar stow

714
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Biggest town

715
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Just to pursue the perfecting loneliness

Just so go get it at me or say

724
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
Gotfossio.com

725
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Hi, this is Scott from American cliché

726
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm always amazed that some of the things I run across online

727
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Read a newspapers or see on TV

728
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Whether it's some sort of bizarre news story

729
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
A slice of pop culture

730
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
An emerging musical talent

731
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Or some random active stupidity

732
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
I never seem to be at a loss for something interesting

733
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
That's sort of the premise for my show

734
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
American cliché

735
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,720
It's basically a crash course in pop culture

736
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
And obscure internet buzz for the week

737
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Give me 30 minutes

738
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720

It's truth really stranger than fiction

743
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Or is that just an American cliché

744
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720

Hello Adam, I'm Dan O'Leary

770
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
And I'm a pilot for a regional airline on the west coast of the United States

771
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
And would you believe I have a podcast

772
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
It's called Hotel Coffee

773
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,720
On Hotel Coffee, I talk about the daily life of an airline pilot

774
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Things to do in great places to eat in the cities that I stay

775
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
And in each episode I feature a song from the pod safe music network

776
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720

Thanks for listening

780
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,720
And may you always have blue skies and tailwinds

781
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Everybody around these mad at me

782
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Because I keep recording everything

783
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
But that's okay

784
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Because my podcast is a surf gravity radio

785
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
And that's what we do here

786
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Straight recordings

787
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Pads safe music

00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
All kind of stuff

790
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
You never know what you're going to tell me

791
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
To come on over to suring.com

792
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Check it out

793
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Say you like me

794
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Yeah well

795
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Hey man, there's a lot of pilots doing pod casting

796
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Use the most out of lighter

797
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Right on

798
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
A lot of pilots doing pod casting

799
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Hey, and I'm going to be flying Friday

800
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Yahoo, Yahoo, yeah

801
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Fucking who I cannot wait

802
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Last trip before she gets disassembled new engine

803
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
A black edition gets put in

804
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Whenever the hell that means but I paid for it

805
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
A new interior, new upholstery

806
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,720
So it's going to be probably four to six weeks then

807
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
It gets shuddled over here

808
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
And I get to have it at my disposal

809
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
I cannot wait

810
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm excited

811
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Is it about aviation and pod casting?

812
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Why does it go together so well?

813
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Or is it maybe just when you have a 10-speed bike

814
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
You see everyone driving 10-speed bikes

815
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Could be or maybe there's really something to it

816
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Oh, Adam, this is Robin

817
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
And this is Suzanne

818
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
We are insideworks.com

819
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,720
That's INSYTWBORKIF.com

820
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Just heard your pain in the plane pod gas

821
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
We've got a good chuckle out of that

822
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Because I had a story from my Air Force career

823
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Suzanne and I met over in Europe

824
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,720
I was flying the AT&T and a body of pent-orders

825
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
And it's suffocated

826
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
We left there, got married and moved to

827
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Southern California Georgia Air Force Base

828
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
On this particular day I had dropped off

829
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
I had VIP in Tucson, Arizona

830
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
And I was flying back

831
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
So low across the Mojave Desert

832
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Back towards Georgia, California

833
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
But in the hour of the flight I had to pee

834
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Well the OV10 did come with a relief tomb

835
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,720
AKA the Champagne class

836
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Use for that exact purpose

837
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
I unstrapped and unzipped

838
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
And I started using that Champagne class

839
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,720
I felt so good but it started to back up

840
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
And overflow

841
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I had a problem

842
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Also at that moment I realized

843
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I was still sitting in an armed ejection seat

844
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Oh my gosh

845
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Honey, that would be really difficult for me

846
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
to understand as a new bride

847
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
If there had been an incident

848
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Why my husband's private parts were hanging out

849
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
While he's flying

850
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
I went nowhere to make it that

851
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
So I did put in the safety pin

852
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Into the seat

853
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
I had to come up with plan B

854
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Because I still had to pee

855
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I crimped the relief tube

856
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Just like a garden hose

857
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
But that didn't work

858
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I fumbled it

859
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
And there was a golden shower

860
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Right in the cockpit

861
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Ew

862
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Yeah pretty nasty

863
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
Plan C

864
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Add some six acts

865
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
I double-bagged him

866
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I wasn't gonna have any more golden showers

867
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
No mistakes

868
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I started filling up the six act

869
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
It felt great

870
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Roll it up very carefully

871
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Set it over on the canopy rail

872
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
And I was a happy guy

873
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
About a half an hour later

874
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
I noticed two things

875
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Something started to smell

876
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
And the bag was expanding

877
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Why was the bag expanding

878
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Well it was summertime

879
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Mojave Desert

880
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
No air conditioning in the OV10

881
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
It was hot things

882
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
We're expanding

883
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Oh my gosh

884
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
So it's like a bag of popcorn

885
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
And a microwave

886
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
That's right

887
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
It was about the blow

888
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
I had to come up with plan D

889
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
The OV10 had an overhead eyeball vent

890
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
And instead of blowing

891
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
I turned it around

892
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
And put it into the suck mode

893
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I carefully unrolled it

894
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Top of this bag

895
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Helped it up to the vent

896
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
And it worked great

897
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
It was sucking here

898
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
And right out that vent

899
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Leave it in a big ol' striped

900
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
And the top of the canopy

901
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Well it was this time

902
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
It's golden arches over the canopy

903
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Yeah golden arches

904
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
It was working great

905
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I was a happy guy

906
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Until it got to the bottom of the bag

907
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
It was sucking so hard

908
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
It tore a hole

909
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Right in the bottom of the bag

910
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
And there was a second golden shower

911
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
In the cockpit

912
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
At the time it was not funny

913
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
But I did think

914
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Someday

915
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Someday

916
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
This is going to be funny

917
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
But right now it's not

918
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Well Adam

919
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
I think this is the day

920
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
He does funny

921
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
It's funny for me

922
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
So from one pilot to another

923
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Here's the peeing

924
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Plains

925
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
And podcaf

926
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
And tailwind

927
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
To you, Adam

928
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
It's super new

929
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Everyone wishes me tailwinds

930
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Love that

931
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Dude

932
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
That's a harrowing story

933
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
It would have been better

934
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
If you would check it out

935
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
With your weiner hanging out

936
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
They would have made the story

937
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
So much better

938
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Speakin' of that skydive radio

939
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Sends in for the MM50 naming context

940
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm gonna wrap this up pretty soon

941
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Because I haven't gotten anything better

942
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I don't think than the porta potty

943
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Uh

944
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
See Adam

945
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
The MM50 really sounds as crisp and clear

946
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Just said

00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720

I don't think last one here for today.

996
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:42,620
As Adam Curry Blastle Park, the old music and recording industry, you need to listen to it

997
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,020
happen on the revolutionary Adam smasher speakers.

998
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,020
No, I don't think so.

999
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,020
Oh my goodness.

1000
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:54,620
Hey, I got tons of people sending me this link about biodiesel.

1001
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,340
Apparently there's been a breakthrough in creating it from vegetable oil.

1002
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,340
There's a link on treehugger.com, of course, that's where you'd find that kind

1003
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,340
of news.

1004
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,700
But it is very exciting because now all of a sudden, biodiesel is really coming to the

1005
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
forefront.

1006
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,220
Now that they're seeing an improvement in efficiency of creating the biodiesel from

1007
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,460
vegetable oil by 10 to 15 percent, man, I so have to get a clunker diesel in San Francisco.

1008
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,780
I promise you, we're going to do these experiments.

1009
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Hi Adam.

1010
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
From the Mac generation.

1011
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,260
I'm leaving you this message because we have a kind of a problem.

1012
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,060
In our podcast, that is in French and about the Macintosh.

1013
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,220
We feature every week, Potsiff Music from the Potsiff Music Network, of course.

1014
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:44,260
And we realized very quickly that there's not a lot of artists, French speaking artists,

1015
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,740
registered in the Potsiff Music Network.

1016
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,740
So with Xavier, that does the podcast.

1017
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,740
Hey, get me Vanessa Paradie.

1018
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,540
Okay, get me Vanessa Paradie.

1019
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,420
As you really unclear, get them into the Potsiff Music Network.

1020
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:01,180
With me, we recorded a message in French for your French speaking listeners.

1021
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,540
So it would be nice if you could play it.

1022
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Bonjour Siril.

1023
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540

1024
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,140

Bonjour Adam.

1029
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,140
Bonjour.

1030
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,940
Alors Siril, je crois que tu n'appell, alancer, en direction des artistes francophones.

1031
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,900
Oui, exactement.

1032
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,660
Sur le podcast de Macgineration, on passe à chaque épisode.

1033
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,220
Donc chaque semaine, de la musique, d'un artiste francophone, c'est possible.

1034
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,460
Eh bien, je l'ai un certain oeuvre.

1035
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,100
Bon, des maybe sing, l'am just a big hair, the fact.

1036
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,260
Donc, on choisit la musique, Potsiff.

1037
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,180
Donc, indirectement, on a choisi le Podsiff Music Network,

1038
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,900
que pour aller chercher toute cette musique.

1039
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,580
Comme ça, on est sûr que la musique correspond

1040
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,500
en licence qui nous permet de l'utiliser sur le podcast de Macgineration.

1041
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,180
Et le problème qu'on a, c'est que les artistes francophones,

1042
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,460
bah, on en a vitefeltour, il y en a très peu.

There's all the rediscover scum and fell and all right

You've got to try everything and the book to make you forget if I said

For the steaks that I made were in the past if I could take it back

00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,220
and flashbacks.

1101
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,020
So we really get more of the music out there.

1102
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,860
Very, very excited about it.

1103
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,180
And yesterday, I unleashed a promo,

1104
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,180
which was my acting attempt at Howard Beal,

1105
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,180
if you remember the movie Network,

1106
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,180
got a lot of interesting audio responses to it already.

1107
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,180
I had him.

1108
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,180
This is Ed from Ed's Mixbag.

1109
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,180
I was getting up out of my chair.

1110
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,180
I was about to shout

1111
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,180
when an inner voice took over and said

1112
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,180
but I soon got a hold of myself,

1113
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,180
when I realized it was just another Adam Curry pod show.com promo.

1114
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,180
Hey, Adam, it's Zen from the Zen Show.

1115
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,180
Listen, right after the release of your most recent promo

1116
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
quit your day job,

1117
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,180
I practically went freaking mental with all of this hype.

1118
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,180
Now, I'm waiting as patiently as I can,

1119
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,180
but you gotta check out this segment from my show.

1120
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,180
It went into today's episode

1121
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,180
and what I'm gonna do here to kind of set this up is

1122
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,180
I'm just gonna play the tail end

1123
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,180
with the part that really caught it hooked me.

1124
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,180
And then I'm gonna launch into about two minutes of comment.

1125
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
I know that's a lot of time to ask,

1126
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,180
but just hang with me.

1127
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,180
Check out this is from today's show.

1128
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,180
Are you ready for the audition?

1129
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,180
Step up and take it.

1130
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,180
Yes, God damn it, I'm ready!

1131
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
I'm telling you,

1132
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,180
I'm gonna sound like a maniac right now

1133
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,180
because up into the last like,

1134
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,180
I don't know, ten seconds,

1135
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,180
it's like, okay, this is kind of strange and weird.

1136
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,180
And then they tell you all about it.

1137
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,180
You know, quit your day job,

1138
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,180
start doing this for a living,

1139
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,180
and however they're gonna have you do it,

1140
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,180
I don't know.

1141
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,180
I hear that last part and it goes from, yeah,

1142
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,180
yeah, okay, yeah, whatever this is going on.

1143
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,180
Oh yeah, you know,

1144
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,180
and it's like totally takes off for me.

1145
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,180
And I'm like,

1146
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,180
tell me what the hell to do!

1147
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,180
Because I wanna do it.

1148
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,180
Well before I was ever in the internet,

1149
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,180
right out of high school,

1150
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,180
this microphone became my best friend.

1151
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
And I had a lot of good friends and people's,

1152
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,180
but I mean, you know,

1153
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,180
you do it through high school,

1154
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,180
you make the date tape,

1155
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,180
the love tape,

1156
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,180
or you just start screwing around with recording your voice,

1157
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,180
you start creating tapes with other friends

1158
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,180
that are doing the same thing.

1159
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,180
Yeah, we were gags,

1160
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,180
but it was expression.

1161
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,180
It was the way we expressed ourselves.

1162
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,180
It was the only way we could not be judged

1163
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,180
by the people that didn't freaking understand us.

1164
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,180
And then you leave it behind.

1165
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,180
And you start with your life.

1166
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,180
And you move on,

1167
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,180
and you do the daily doldrum,

1168
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,180
and you forget where your passion is.

1169
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,180
And that's a tragedy.

1170
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,180
So now I've been doing this for over a month now.

1171
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,180
It's gonna be coming up actually on two months here.

1172
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,180
And like a blink of an eye, two months.

1173
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,180
I'm ready to quit.

1174
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,180
I'm ready to quit my day job,

1175
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,180
and do this,

1176
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,180
or do something like it,

1177
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,180
or just follow this thing,

1178
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,180
to wherever it takes me.

1179
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,180
It's a little frightened,

1180
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,180
because I sound crazy when I talk about it.

1181
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,180
But, yeah, there it is.

1182
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
It's out there.

1183
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,180
I'm just, I'm ready to scrub toilets

1184
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,180
for the opportunity to do this.

1185
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,180
All right, so.

1186
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,180
Adam could teasing me.

1187
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,180
I'm ready to do it, man.

1188
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,180
Whatever it is.

1189
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,180

we're all waiting with Bated Breath.

1194
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,180
We're hyped up.

1195
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,180
We're ready to take this audition.

1196
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,180
Tell us what to do, man.

1197
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,180
Take care.

1198
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,180
I'm mad.

1199
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,180
I want to quit my day job.

1200
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,180
Hi, Adam.

1201
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,180
This is Rich Palmer,

1203
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,180
I just wanted to let you know.

And the good is,

00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,180
just keep doing what you're doing.

1208
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,180
Nothing else is required.

1209
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,180
Another pot show pot cast.

1210
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,180
Stick it in your ear.

1211
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,180
I want to quit my day job.

1212
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,180
I want to quit my day job.

00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,180
I want to quit my day job.

1216
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,180
I want to quit my day job.

1217
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,180
I want to quit my day job.

1218
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,180
I want to quit my day job.

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,180
