1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Transmidders, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh god, we're casting with Adam Curry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, finally, a source code.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It still exists.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, I got lots to talk about because we are still not connected.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But we don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We got the podcast.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Your source code for Thursday, January 13th, 2000.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Whoah, boy.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My goodness.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's all you.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's been quite a few days.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Last time we spoke was Monday, which was was it.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That was the temp.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That was the last podcast from South Beach in Florida.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Since then, I have been, well, pretty much in transit.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My back just aches from sitting on airplanes, sitting in cars,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and doing anything with actually exercise.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And of course, it's a throwback to the motorcycle accident.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And you've got to exercise that shit.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You know what I'm saying?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No matter what, 40 minutes for you on the source code.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let me see, what is it?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm trying to think what's best to start off with.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, maybe I just tell you a little bit about the trip

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
where I've been, why I've not actually been able to record a source code.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I got to tell you that I actually did have a chance doing that yesterday.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And the car as I post on curie dot com with taxi Eric,

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
as I was going from Amsterdam to Antwerp to close on the sale of the castle.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I was just so tired.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I've been sleeping.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm like a super model now.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You know, not eating.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sleeping everywhere I can.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Every limo.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, shoot.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I forgot.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't have any limo.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's overrated.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So left Monday after winging by the apple store to pick up an ice skin for Christina's iPod Mini,

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
because apparently they're all sold out here in the area.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I didn't know there was an apple store in the area in the Gilbert area.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then went off to the to the airport.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Of course, my flight was delayed.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But what was cool is that I guess that's this is probably the perfect time.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Maybe here's the secret to British airways.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you want to get an upgrade.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
First of all, you've got to travel at the right time of year, which around Christmas

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
time with a winter time to Miami is clearly a very desirable time to fly.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The tickets.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I got the world traveler, which is like economy, but economy plus so that if you want to, you can

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
change your ticket.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which I thought might, you know, could actually be one of the possibilities being in

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
South Beach and the meetings we were having.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There was a possibility maybe we'd go up to New York or maybe I'd go directly back

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
to Antwerp, which of course didn't work out that way.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I had to go a day later, which screwed it up.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So anyway, what you want to do is you want to have that world traveler so that you are

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the first in line before the real economy tickets.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If there's an upgrade possibility.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And combined with the fact that it's in the winter time and everyone wants to fly

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to Miami or it's flying back or it's traveling to and from Miami.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They're overselling the economy seats.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So if you were calling on the way over, I got upgraded to first class on the way back.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I got upgraded to business class or club as they call it on British Air.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And that means that you do get a sleeper seat, which is not quite this.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It used to be different.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I remember the first class sleeper seats and you get like a little mattress.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They put down for you and they put sheets in and they folded back and you get

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
little pajamas.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is when they had, I don't know if you care about this shit.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But it was interesting.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They had a for a while.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This great offer.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You could fly with the Concord from London to New York and return first class on the sleeper

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
seat on the 747, which is the overnight flight.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For a total of, I think, if I was, this was back in the, so this was 90.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Most of this was 90.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No, this was 2000.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, before they took the Concord out, maybe it was a little bit before that.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But it was no more than like, I think it was $4,000.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And of course, this is pretty all the new pricing and all these wonderful airport taxes.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Please don't, don't think it's a fucking tax from the government.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's just a way of airlines sucking more money out of you and pretending it's something

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
due to the government by calling it a tax, which it's not.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's just landing fees and more costs that they're writing off as a tax.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's what they're telling you.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They have to pay the airport of fee.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean, that's always been that way.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You always have to pay the airport of fee per passenger or per weight of the plane.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If I land with a rinketing plane, I also have to pay a fee.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But now they're basically just passing it onto you and calling it a tax.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Anyway, so don't get me started again on that.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the, so it's not comparable to what it used to be.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But still, it was nice to lay down almost completely vertical.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I almost fit entirely between the footrest and the headrest.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So it was better than nothing.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But arrive needless to say a little bit, you know, broken.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am 517 after all.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And there was no lovely little, what do you call it?

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mattress to lay on.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And of course, you know, it's an overnight flight.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is the jet lag flight, right?

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I got home and there's all kinds of crap going on with the, with the closing of the house,

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
which was the next day and Antwerp and there was like a taxation issue.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, you don't want to come home after that flight and have to talk taxation issues.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And then of course, as it sold, then Christina's horse princess or pony actually,

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it has to be brought over.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So that's this Friday.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And so just all kinds of things to coordinate.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My god.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What horrible things to have to coordinate.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not really complaining.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm just letting me in my life.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And then the next day, I was up early to go to Antwerp.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And the only choices I had were drive two hours almost to London City,

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
which has a direct flight on the VLM Airlines to Antwerp.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Or go to Gatwick.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Actually, yeah, go to Gatwick.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then I had taxi Eric drive me down, which is probably about an hour and 15 minutes.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And of course, an hour and 15 minutes back.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I was able to see a couple other people on the way, such as my friend's purple rain in Brida.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Remember I've spoken about them, my Moroccan friend.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I wanted to talk a little bit about actually about easy jet.

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But first, oh yes.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Of course, we've got some cadence for you.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And I apologize in advance.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have not been very good with my show notes.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I had kept this one because I knew that I wanted to play it.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But not quite sure where I got it from.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's called testicular fortitude.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Enjoy.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
45 minutes or 45 seconds of cadence.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Just good enough.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I support out.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The testicular fortitude and other cadence on the daily source code, apologies.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just don't know where it came from.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And of course, the title of that reminds me of the my pods forecast, which I played a couple of.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, maybe a week and a half ago.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's the podcaster that does stock picks and most recently lottery numbers.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
By consulting his testicles.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Shoot man.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I got to find that.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's coming through on openpodcast.org.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I think if you go to my podsforcast.com.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And actually, what's most amazing is the math that he uses behind coming up with the yes,

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
no path to finding out the path to choosing numbers.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Please listen to that.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It will be well worth the time.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So about easy jet.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I never actually flown on easy jet.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And this is a very short hop to go from London to Amsterdam.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's about, I can totally guess you really know flying no more than maybe 35, 40 minutes.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Of course, the, let's just say in our altogether, depending.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And that's really from takeoff to landing.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And it just depends on, you know, road and weather conditions, obviously.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I'd been on British Airways.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I'd done KLM, of course.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And as I was reserving this trip.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I was doing that in South Beach.

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was looking at the ticket prices.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And, you know, of course, what happens is when you do a round trip.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You book on January 12th to go to Amsterdam and return January 12th.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So all of a sudden, for some reason, I guess you're positioned as a business customer.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And your, your coach fair ticket.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Your coach ticket fair is like 300 pounds.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know, that's close to 500 dollars.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like, I don't fucking think so.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So then, of course, I tried to beat the system by booking one way.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Or booking January 12th is going over.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And some ridiculous date, like February 20th coming back.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I saw the, of course, the trip over was all of a sudden, only 40 pounds.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And then I, of course, tried to do the reverse.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And, well, they do kind of catch on that.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know, where I then booked a trip back from the 12th.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Or from the 12th to London and a return trip.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And a much later date, but they, they kind of catch on that.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But it doesn't really work.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I said, screw it.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You know, and I, and I checked a couple other airlines.

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What is it to be in my British Midland?

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And they were.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So that was still 180 pounds.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So 250 dollars.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I just, this became a sport.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You know, it actually has become a sport.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Because I really don't give a shit.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You know, if I'm flying in the toilet, or if I'm actually flying the plane,

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
which I couldn't with this, these particular models.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But, you know, I just want to do it efficiently and effectively.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And, and the game is to do it cheaply.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So I looked up easy jet, which had never really flown.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And they have a flight from Gatway to Amsterdam.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And the total price round trip with the times that I was going.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I'd left around 11 of an even in the end.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Whoops.

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Did we hear that?

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That was kind of funky.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Thank God for digital recording.

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So left around 11 a.m. on Tuesday.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Was it Tuesday?

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wednesday?

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Sorry.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm so confused.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Left little 11 a.m.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And returned on the quarter of ten or five to ten p.m.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
same day.

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And so the total was about 80 pounds, which I thought was really good.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And so I went to the airport.

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You know, all you do is just show up with your printout.

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You don't even have to do that.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can just say your name, show your ID.

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And you don't even have a confirmation number.

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Or you do, but you don't need it.

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Give it a boarding pass.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And it's just, it's a really nice experience.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
All the way from, you know, going to the lounge.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And everyone's the same, right?

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's no, no one gets preference over anything.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There is a number on your ticket, which is a labeled like,

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you know, one to, well, depending on the size of the plane.

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Maybe a hundred, let's just say.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So you can say, you know, people with the numbers one to 50,

234
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you know, could you please start boarding now and about two minutes later.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's just crowd control, basically, to get you to line up nicely.

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But there's really no checking.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know, they don't have to go through any real computer systems,

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
looking at spots where you're sitting, because there's no reserved seating.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Everything is all the same.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And when you get on the plane, a couple of things I noticed right off the bat,

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
because the whole intent of this service is to be like a bus.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And it is just like a bus.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's three rows on the right hand side, three rows on the left hand side.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a very broad plane.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it actually, well, go figure, it is the Airbus 319.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's the model that we flew.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's really comfortable to walk in.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You don't have to crouch or anything.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Certainly for tall people like myself.

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There's plenty of storage space.

251
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There's just no, no frills, no thrills, right?

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's just seats, right in left, three, three, everything's three.

253
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There's no two seaters, no one.

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There's no single, actually, the exit row.

255
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I take that back.

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The exit row does have a little bit more space,

257
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but you can't move your chair back.

258
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So you want to avoid the exit rows.

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But for some reason, because you know that you're guaranteed absolutely no service,

260
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
because that's the deal, right?

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You get no service.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There's just, you know, we're going to help you on.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We're going to keep you safe.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And the girls are great.

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The cabin crew, I only had stewardesses or flight attendants,

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
female, both going and coming.

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know if they have a male flight attendants.

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sure they must.

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Totally nice.

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because all they have to do is basically keep you safe.

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So they're smiling and they help you sit down.

272
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They just have to make sure you get your seat belt buckled.

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And otherwise, there's nothing.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Of course, when you're in the air, then they say,

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
hey, would you like to purchase a drink?

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So they don't come through the aisle.

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They just say, look, if you want some of the drink,

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
or something to eat, just turn on your overhead light.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And then also in the old jump in actions,

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
there's maybe five flight attendants.

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And they just run back and forth real quick,

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
get you whatever you want.

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And they give you a chance you pay to pay for it.

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I think I bought a tea and a big cheese and tomato.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You say tomato, I said tomato.

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I said tomato now.

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
A tomato sandwich was like four pounds,

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
50 altogether.

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I guess cheaper than if it's actually built into the price of the ticket,

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
clearly.

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And then when that's all over,

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
when they've delivered everyone,

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
whatever they purchase,

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
then it's very simple for them, right?

295
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They don't have to really prepare anything.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Then they come by with a big trash bag,

297
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and everyone just chips in and throws your shit into the trash bag.

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They've also passed out the company magazine,

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
which they come back and collect.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So that's where a lot of the savings come in.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You know, it's not like you.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You don't, I think I guess you could take the magazine with you if you wanted,

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
but basically the operation just really smart, really tight.

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And there's something about knowing that you're not going to get any service,

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and knowing that the flight attendants don't have to provide any service,

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
which just makes it great.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, it's like it's, you know,

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm not expecting anything,

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
if I get a smile, I'm already happy,

310
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and let's be honest.

311
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't get them any fucking smiles from first-class flight attendants.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, I'm liking it.

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Those Steve Ross, what is it,

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
set the guys name?

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
George, Jorge, George, Steve Ross.

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Shit, I should look his name up.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Ah, of course I can't get on the internet right now.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah, let's talk about that for a second.

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So anyway, easy jet, fantastic.

320
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know what it would be like to travel more than two and a half hours,

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
if it was really packed, but I, I'm going to tell you,

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm going to do that, I'm going to, this is a great formula.

323
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And it has a lot to do with the way the plane is configured as well.

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's not just the cheap tickets.

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, and by the way, their tax is interesting.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You'd think that if it really was a tax,

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
all tax would be the same.

328
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No, you can fly the same distance,

329
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
this from London to Amsterdam with the KLM.

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Their tax is 44 pounds.

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Easy jet's tax is only 10 pounds.

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You know why?

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Because it's horseshit.

334
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's not a real tax.

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay?

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a fucking rip off.

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Just say, you know, we're charging you for our overhead.

338
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay.

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I tried to stop by a wing commander Williams place on the,

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
on the trip back from Antwerp.

341
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I really wanted to drop by, but everything took so long.

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And you know, house closing sometimes can just be a,

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
yeah, it's not a pain in the asses.

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Of course I'm happy, but just, you know,

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
read through everything and there's questions and answers.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So I didn't get to see him, but he said, Adam,

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you better get your ass over here for a couple of days.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Gonna teach you how to fly.

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Get you going because, you know, this commercial flying is just not,

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
not for boys like you.

351
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're right.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're right.

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I need to push metal the metal pull back on that stick.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Put on the autopilot and pour my own cup of tea.

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I'm sure we'll have some podcasts about that in the future.

356
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So let's talk about bandwidth.

357
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So of course I came home.

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I told you that, well, I showed you the emails.

359
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I put them on the weblog.

360
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yes, the bandwidth was going to be here.

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Plugged in the router or router, as we say.

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And got the whamlight flashing and flashing and flashing.

363
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So I'm gonna cut straight to the chase.

364
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I've had two days of straight calling around with easy net

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
with British telecom.

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Everyone has a different story, but the, you know,

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
everything, the job is completed, but yet it's not working.

368
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The measurements are wrong.

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We don't understand.

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So I finally found this guy Lee at easy net.

371
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then he had a different number.

372
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He had an O2O number, which is different from the O845 numbers

373
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've been dialing.

374
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And Lee definitely has a shit together.

375
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So I say, Lee, you're my man.

376
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And about 30 minutes after speaking to Lee,

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
British telecom shows up at the door.

378
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is good news, I think, because here comes the cavalry.

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They're in.

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
They're gonna fix it all.

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They're gonna figure me out.

382
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Shoot, hold on.

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I have something to, need to share with you right after I talk about this.

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay, here we go.

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So these guys, and it's, they're nice guys.

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
John and, um, who was his apprentice.

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's got an apprentice.

388
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And I can tell he's an apprentice, right?

389
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
He's a young kid.

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And he's got a, like, his, his British telecom jacket.

391
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's like crackling fresh.

392
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I was bustin' on him because he, you know, he could, he said.

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I said, what's going on?

394
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Because John was on the phone and talking to people,

395
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know.

396
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm really new.

397
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So yes, your jacket gave it away, my friend.

398
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So I actually took pictures of this.

399
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You're not gonna believe it.

400
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So we follow the line.

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
In my office here, there's the jack.

402
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's got the jack reference number and it's all set, right?

403
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We follow the line to where it goes out the house.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And down the side of the house.

405
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And into the junction box and the side of the house.

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And there you see.

407
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes, I had to take a picture of it.

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It'll be on the, the web log.

409
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There you see the wires just sticking out of the junction box.

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Connect it to nothing.

411
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And if you go down to the corner to the curb, actually,

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and you look at the, the BT box at the corner,

413
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
of course, they opened it up for me.

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I guess what?

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They were like a pair of wires sitting there,

416
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
just ready to be connected to the ones in my house.

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Which apparently, according to all the paperwork was done,

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
but obviously wasn't completed.

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So that does kind of explain why no one could get the fucking measurement right.

420
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And it just went from, from bad to worse, from worse to horrible,

421
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
from, so then it's like, well, we can't open up a new order

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
unless, I don't even want to get into it.

423
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This fucking crap.

424
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So anyway, so I called Lee back, he's working on it.

425
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And what has to happen is literally some other guy has to get the order to come out here

426
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
with 40 feet of fucking wire and connected from the curb up to the house.

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I have half a mind to go get some goddamn wire myself

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and solder that fucker up tonight.

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I'm going to give him a second to tell me when they,

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and it's convenient for them to come and actually do this for me.

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So until then, it's me and Starbucks or me and the neighbors.

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I just, you know, now I really should go figure out which neighbors

433
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
providing this Wi-Fi to me because I've been fetching off it for so long

434
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and I have to continue doing it.

435
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I just hope that I wouldn't have to deal with it.

436
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Anyway, one thing I wanted to say that when I do that get disconnected

437
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and I'm going to say Monday, well, I'm a business customer now, right?

438
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm not just some asshole residential smuck.

439
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Now I'm a business customer.

440
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I get, I get escalated.

441
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
God, this pisses me off.

442
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I was going to say, so anyways, I get escalated and maybe Monday, maybe Monday.

443
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
All right.

444
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Adam Elman sent me an email.

445
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Adam, hi, hopefully by the time you read this,

446
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you'll have your net up and running.

447
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I thought that this song for my band's recent album

448
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
will help you celebrate broadband at home again.

449
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Adam says, I once had SPC accidentally disconnect my DSL line.

450
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Took six weeks for him to turn it back on, almost went insane.

451
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So I know where you're coming from.

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay, the band, sinister dexter.

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And of course, put a link up to their site.

454
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
They're also on garageband.com as slash syntax.

455
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Song has a creative comments license.

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So completely pod safe music.

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You'll like the title, dig the tune.

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is called broadband connection.

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was just a hot beer.

460
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was just a hot beer.

461
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm gonna get funky.

462
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You better shout it out.

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll get into your room now here.

464
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Can you feel it to your heart's size?

465
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes, can you hear our hand of your insights?

466
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Can you feel how it is to feel it though?

467
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you read right around your head down to what your toes closed up,

468
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I hope the heart that doesn't dribble drops a groove.

469
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Did you expect a powerful gun to make a fire and move into it?

470
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Good luck with this sound.

471
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let their rhythm roll and make a run back and action to your soul.

472
00:22:38,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

473
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:38,000
oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

474
00:23:38,000 --> 00:24:08,000
One, two, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four

475
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,240
Yeah, broadband connection to your soul brought to you by Senator Dexter from the city, Dexterity,

476
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,760
check them out on garageband.com, of course, in the podcast show notes is where you can find links to them.

477
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:33,440
Being in South Beach for over a week, I didn't, as I think we discussed, I didn't really see any,

478
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,440
any, I didn't watch any television, I just like the last day I watched by an hour of TV,

479
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,880
was actually blown away by the speed of the hypnotization process. Within seconds, I was like,

480
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm hypnotized, I'm like, I am slave to the machine, but, you know, with everything going on

481
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,720
with the tsunami, with the state of the entire fucking world, and what's this with the,

482
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,760
don't we have, we're blasting into some kind of comment, we've got, what is it,

483
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,120
to such a Bruce Willis type name, deep, deep mission, or deep blaster, or mission critical,

484
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,440
something, we're trying to shoot a rocket into this meteorite to see what happens, basically,

485
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,720
is what I understood, but just mesmerizing stuff. But the big news that I miss, and it really is

486
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:37,680
big news, everyone was talking about this, is the Brad Pitt Jennifer Aniston split, and I,

487
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:44,080
first of all, I got to tell you, I was shocked, I really was. I liked them, you know, there's such a,

488
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,320
such a beautiful couple together, and it was so perfect, because you know, the Brad really needs some,

489
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,680
he's, he needs a mom out of take care of, I mean, you know, the Jennifer's, you know,

490
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,680
she's a strong woman, and she takes no shit, and she's going to take care of him, and, you know,

491
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,720
you just see the way they interacted, I thought that this was a real, this could really last,

492
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,120
I thought that this would really work, and that if anyone could make him, especially then, you know,

493
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,120
the, although I think Brad can probably, Brad Pitt has more sex appeal than Jennifer Aniston,

494
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,320
clearly, it's amazing when you, I mean, his world is just filled with people throwing themselves

495
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,560
at him, female and male for that matter, and, you know, they're both famous, it just, it works,

496
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:31,040
it's so perfect, and you could, I thought really the way they, they communicated together,

497
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,120
the way they acted when they were, you know, or at least what you could see on television,

498
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,480
and news, I don't know, either of them personally, and just the way they talk about each other,

499
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,600
I thought that was for real, and maybe it is for real, maybe they just can't live together,

500
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,880
but to, what happens is immediately the spin goes down, you know, it's like, well, it's, of course,

501
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,080
it's because of Angelina Jolie, because Brad did a movie with her, and she's known to, you know,

502
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,480
sleep with her co-stars, and, well, I don't know if that's true, right? I'm just telling you what I'm

503
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,800
reading, and the papers here, and with more follow-up on this, on the breakup, and what I saw on TV

504
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,320
in the States, and having been the subject of stories like that, although, I guess it was only

505
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
really in the beginning when Patricia and I, we've been married for 17 years, we've been together

506
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:23,200
for almost 19 now. So, no reason for this, for this shit, to not work anymore. And let's

507
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,240
broadband, doesn't get fucking fixed, because I'll just go fucking insane, and she'll have to

508
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:40,400
divorce me, it'll all be the fault of British telecom. So anyway, so that's the story, right,

509
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,240
is that Angelina Jolie, she seduced Brad, and Jennifer would have none of that, and, and of course,

510
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,640
then this, and it's something really hurtful that is out there now, is that Brad wants kids,

511
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,280
Jennifer doesn't, because she still wants to move her career forward, doesn't want to enter

512
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,480
career, I guess having kids meet ending her career, in this, in the context of what I'm reading, right?

513
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,320
She wants to do some serious acting, doesn't want to end on the, I'm the Dits from Friends

514
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,240
vibe, which I can totally understand, and I'm not quite sure how old she is, I think she's in

515
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,760
her early 30s, so I think she has a little bit of time, if she, if she's so prefers before having to,

516
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,600
you know, kind of catch up with a biological clock, that's pretty hurtful shit, you know,

517
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
when people say that, it's just, even if it's true, it's hurtful for it being discussed,

518
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,320
and of course, the reason, you know, that everything all went downhill, as they were in the

519
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,600
Caribbean, you know, having a reconciliation weekend, don't know if it's true, and Brad had

520
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,680
tickets to the Super Bowl, and so he went left to go back to the Super Bowl, and then he came back,

521
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,960
and then they split up, and whatever, so there's really no revelant, relative, oh, man,

522
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:55,440
wait, let me get the latency off, no relevance, between my life and theirs, except for one thing,

523
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,680
because I said to Patricia, I said, you know, so wait a minute, so you're going to tell me that

524
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,760
because he, let's just say he slept with Angelina Jolie, right? So they're on the set of the

525
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,920
movie, you know, it's, you're working hard, you're in close proximity, I have no idea what the

526
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,320
movie is, but maybe there's a love scene, there's, I mean, come on, it's a beautiful, beautiful guy,

527
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,800
beautiful girl, there can be some attraction there, and so let's say that they did have a hot

528
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,760
wicked affair, you know, said, so that's, is that really the reason why Jennifer is, is

529
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,440
divorcing him, or that they're getting divorced, and Patricia said, yeah, I think that she's

530
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,520
really, she's a tough cookie, she's taken no shit, you know, and with her, you, you do that

531
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,200
and you're out, and then so then she took a beat and she says, besides, you know that, you know,

532
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:50,960
if you called me, I'd say go for it, I was like, hold on, can I get that in writing, just in case

533
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,600
I meet Ms. Jolie somewhere? Oh, anyway, what are we at now? We're at 29 minutes, okay,

534
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,960
still got some stuff to talk about, and I'm really trying to pair down a lot of the

535
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,960
elements in the show, and actually, this is going to be a good reset moment for me, and I

536
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,280
hopefully erasing for all of you, I'm getting lots of email actually from people saying, oh,

537
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,520
you know, even though it sucks that we haven't had a source code in three days, it's really cool

538
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,960
that we can actually sync up and catch up on previous episodes. So that's good, so maybe I should do

539
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,280
that once a month, you know, drop a couple of days and see if everyone can kind of sync up.

540
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,800
There are of course some comments that came in. Yeah, let's do a, I had something else lined up.

541
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,560
I'm going to do a comment, audio comment first, and I'll get back to some other stuff that's

542
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,760
been floating around the, the, the, the, the, the blogger sphere and podosh sphere. Greetings and

543
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,800
salutations to you, Prince of Podu. Okay, this starts off great. Isn't that wonderful? This is

544
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,880
Jennifer, the girl on tech. I host the girl on tech podcast at girl on tech.plogspot.com,

545
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,560
and let me get the old Boeing out of the way here, a Boeing moment for you. I enjoy the show tremendously

546
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,920
especially the, uh, I heard that I got some email from, uh, from a couple of people that

547
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,440
Letterman had Boeing now in the top 10 of, uh, of ways to make the news cooler, I think it was,

548
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,400
and maybe it was CBS news, uh, Dan Rathers show, um, and number five was, uh, ad comedic

549
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,240
volume, after every item. The, you know, the Boeing's are getting out there. Now it's mainstream,

550
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,000
you know, Letterman's picked it up. So I guess, well, that's the quote with something else.

551
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,840
A recent show you did the, uh, walking through a South Beach and beautiful Miami.

552
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,920
The sound seeing too. And just keep doing what you're doing out and you're doing a fantastic job.

553
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,400
Okay, Jen. Hey, just talking about Jen. It's my own Jennifer.

554
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,720
Um, quick question for you. Um, as I've mentioned on my blog, I am doing a lecture

555
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,360
at the 2005 Indiana Computer Educators Conference.

556
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Uh, is that hot when we're in talk like that? Hold on, let's just be the real one.

557
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,120
Uh, keep keep me out, baby.

558
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,480
At the 2005 Indiana Computer Educators Conference, excellent teacher. Uh, January 26th through the 29th

559
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
and uh, at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianaapolis. My goodness, teacher. Okay, great.

560
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:19,040
And I'm doing a lecture entitled Classroom MTV using classroom MTV. Wow.

561
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,680
I don't know if the words classroom and MTV can actually be fit into the, into the same

562
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,840
setting using digital media to enhance standards and learning. And all the participants of this lecture

563
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,480
actually going to receive a CD with a software and manuals and how to use that I'm putting together.

564
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,120
And one of the areas that I'm definitely going to cover is blogging, RSS and podcast course.

565
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,920
Um, in the CD, I'm actually including some sample podcast one from James Basour.

566
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,720
I've actually gotten an okay from Jay Rosen to include his academia lecture from blogger

567
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,520
com 3 and I was wanting to ask if you would allow me to include your podcasting lecture

568
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,760
from blogger com 3 as well in the little sample CD. I'd really appreciate it. That's basically

569
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,560
all I've got on my mind. So again, keep up the great work Adam and uh, here's another

570
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,920
boring for you baby. Oh, you have baby. Thank you. Um, that's actually, I guess there's a question

571
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,640
for, for Dave Winner. I'm not sure. Um, I would presume. It sounds actually like the CD

572
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,480
you're making would be a fantastic resource. Uh, so maybe that would be something to think about

573
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,040
if we can get all of that stuff on, uh, on a, on a, on a, on a site somewhere. I mean, that would be

574
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,640
great. Patricia just walking while that clip was playing. You still there, huh?

575
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,440
Come here. You can't do that. Dude, come here.

576
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,520
So Patricia's standing out. And you know, this is why this is why we have studio doors right

577
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,240
that have a big red on air light and has soundproofing. So you can't have like people

578
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,920
standing outside and listening. So she heard the whole Angelina Jolie bit did I lie? Did I lie? Did I

579
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:09,440
lie? I heard did I lie? Did you say that or not? I said that. Yeah, exactly. And but I'm sure

580
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:20,800
of myself. I've got great lips too. Oh, boy. Thank you. Okay. I love you very much. I love you, too, baby.

581
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,680
It's okay. But you know, if, if you want to have sex with Angelina Jolie, it's okay, too.

582
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:33,120
Could you just take a, like video? All right. Okay. She's into it. She, uh, to totally

583
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:41,760
into it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's call her. Yeah. All right. Cool. Okay. Let's talk something

584
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,840
completely nerdy. Going from the sexual to the nerdy. And he hurts felt. I don't actually

585
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,200
know, I didn't know too much about him, been reading up on him. He's not, not an original founder

586
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,280
of Apple, but he did come in pretty early on the Macintosh. And he's, uh, I think he's coming out

587
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:09,680
with a book, but he was interviewed recently at, uh, was it seen it or by seen it? And I don't think

588
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,680
he quite understands podcasting. I'm just going to read this bit to you because it was in a written

589
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,560
interview. He says, I'm down on podcasts. I think it's ridiculous. Suddenly it's taking the

590
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,560
information and making it completely inaccessible. You can't read it and besides a podcast is

591
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,880
nothing. It's streaming MP3s. That's good. But no one can take credit for inventing a new term

592
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
because streaming MP3s is simple and has been around for a while. Doing it through RSS enclosures

593
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,040
is basically bad to automatically download big files before hearing them. The whole thing about

594
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,240
audio is that it has, that it has to be small, uh, since it's a weird sentence. I'm going to read

595
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,640
it exactly the way it's written. The whole thing about audio is that it has small enough bandwidth

596
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,680
that you can stream. Okay. You just can't stream from an iPod because it doesn't have a network

597
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,360
connection yet. I'm excited about getting an iPod with 802-11 so I can stream to my airport

598
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:14,240
express without carrying my Macaron. This is, this is so typical. This is exactly the problem.

599
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,280
I presume that Andy Hertzfeld is, is an engineer. He's thinking exactly, he's, he's completely

600
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,720
missing the point and this is probably why Apple hasn't picked up on podcasting because they're

601
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,720
thinking exactly this way precisely the, they're thinking from Apple out to the rest of the world

602
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:45,120
they're not seeing what's happening. And, you know, to to misunderstand the idea of downloading things

603
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:51,280
before you've heard them to have, you know, a high-quality experience. I mean, yeah, Andy, sure,

604
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,360
if we all have fucking fiber up our ass wirelessly attached, yeah, okay, I can probably get there,

605
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:04,160
you know, but it's, anyway, so the entire text is going to be in the production show notes

606
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,080
and it's very discouraging. Of course, it also, you know, this plays completely into, you know,

607
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,040
a lot of the things we were talking in South Beach about and this is where all the opportunity is,

608
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,920
so great, you know, I'm just blown away and you know, these guys aren't dumb, they're just not seeing

609
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:29,520
it, just not seeing it, not, not living in my world, that's for sure, okay. Wow, yeah, pretty interesting

610
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,080
and how about that, you know, let's, while we're on Apple for a second, let me, what time do I have?

611
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,280
God damn, I'm not going to be able to, well, I could just hurry up through a couple of things here.

612
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,760
So the new Apple products, I think the, the mini is very intriguing, I might actually just buy one,

613
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,080
just to hook it up and see how it works and, I don't know, interesting, very interesting,

614
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:55,520
there's a little computer like that, although, you know, okay, you're getting laptop,

615
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:06,560
territory, it's interesting, but the, the iPod shuffle, what? This is like, like, makes no sense at all,

616
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
and I, you know, I love stuff that Apple makes, I really do, I mean, clearly, you know that,

617
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,480
but what is up, you know, this shuffle thing and, no, makes no sense to me, and for that kind of money,

618
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,200
I'd get an I river and, and a pair of white, you know what they, do they actually just sell

619
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,360
white headsets, you know, there's a market for you, all you got to do is just sell the white

620
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,320
headphones with a white wire, that's it, that is a million dollar business right there, I'm sure

621
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,040
someone's already doing it, but you've got to totally, you'll go out, market it so that you can

622
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,400
walk around with a piece of shit, MP3 player and iPod, whatever, you know, iPod equivalent,

623
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,240
as long as you have the white headphones, then, you know, you're cool, you're going to be with it,

624
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,120
and maybe, you know, I don't know, but this thing, for the money, it just made no sense to me,

625
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:58,560
absolutely not, okay, well, I guess, let me see, I had a good joke in there, but I don't feel

626
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,640
like doing a joke today, I'll keep that for tomorrow, okay, although let me just put that down to the

627
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,200
bottom of the outline, yep, still working with my opml show notes, okay, I'm going to play this one

628
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,880
little bit from the podcast brothers, that's a podcast, I listen to regularly, they do crack me up,

629
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,080
and these guys, not quite sure who they are, what they're about, I think they're organizing a podcast

630
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:27,280
conference pretty soon or maybe a trade show, so I'll have to listen up and check them out and

631
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,720
listen to, you know, what's going on? Of course, I have to go to Starbucks now to download the podcast,

632
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,720
so I may drop behind a pick and how long it takes BT to connect that 40 foot piece of wire.

633
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,920
You can check them out yourself at podcastbrothers.com. Of course, all the podcasts are listed in the

634
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,640
iPod.org directory, that's a great resource, so we can go basically search in the directory

635
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:57,920
by category, and if you want to hear the list, 100 podcasts, it's audio.weblogs.com, so here's this

636
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,240
clip that was actually released as a clip, I think on the opempodcast.org by the brothers themselves.

637
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,880
Instead, listening to that day's podcast, we noticed that Adam was talking about his hair, so

638
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,080
we didn't get a mashup of his podcast, we hope he likes it.

639
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,280
My hair cut. Personal grooming, my hair, the total package, you know, my eyes, why am I doing

640
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,920
this? She did my hair. I love it when Patricia does my hair. It just looks so good. Could you please

641
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,320
do my hair? So wash it, cut it up a little bit, just perfectly, just the way I love it. And now I

642
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,280
got to be real careful with it. I just did your hair, so it's not to mess up the hair, so the hair

643
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,280
will be beautiful. So Adam, we're just Adam, you're hair, man. Yeah, yeah, you must use a lot of

644
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,520
hair products. Actually, I don't use a lot of hair products, actually. I don't know. I just

645
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,280
like it really dirty, kind of like a rostophari. You know, so you can mold it and shape it and

646
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,680
bend it anyway you want. Some sure. Yeah, hey, you know what? He would be a good, good commercial

647
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,560
now for geeks for a hair product. Well, he should eat. Hey, geeks, you too, could look like me and

648
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,000
get hot chicks who will have sex with you and Angelina, Jolie. Should get somebody should sponsor him.

649
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,800
So hair product. They should. And Adam, who does his rose-coded glasses, but those are cool.

650
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,960
They're also real. They're actually prescription. Minus 2, minus 2.75. And did you see the shirt?

651
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,920
They've won or posted some pictures with them. That's not totally fair.

652
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,600
Oh, my, I mean, South Beach, sorry. South Beach. And these boys are listening to the show.

653
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,880
Adam, very sharp dresser. Really? I haven't seen a picture of Adam Curry.

654
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,640
What? I haven't seen Adam Curry since. Oh, yeah, you got to go check it out.

655
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,240
Yeah. You're like, I don't know. I'll tell you. I'll email those colored glasses on.

656
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,560
You're going to see those colored glasses. And they shirt. Adam, I don't know if

657
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,840
you have his shirt. He does. He actually called yesterday just for that reason.

658
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,560
It's your daily source code. Oh, man. How cool is that? The syvee is biddies everybody.

659
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,160
Great. Give it up for him. Fantastic. And I have it on very good authority that we could be seeing a

660
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:39,200
bitty cast before too long. That's it for today's podcast.

661
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,920
Come Thursday. And of course, tomorrow we'll be back with the thank god's Friday

662
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,000
edition of the daily source code. All right. That's it. Oh, by the way,

663
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,760
could someone please send me a Gmail invite so I can open up a Gmail account for audio comments?

664
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,600
This is, you know, it's not a control on the Mac account. I only have like 200 megs left over

665
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,840
whatever. So, send me an invite so I can open up something at gmail.com.

666
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Okay, that's it. I'm going to rush off to Starbucks to shoot this up to the server and

667
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,360
be home just in time for some South Beach phone calls. Hey, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

668
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:25,840
I have more about what's going on. Maybe a British telecom update. Thanks for checking out

669
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:42,960
take care. See you tomorrow.
