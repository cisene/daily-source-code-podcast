00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Delta shared Charlie two two three good morning everybody. Welcome. It is Tuesday morning

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:18,920
The date is the 16th of August 2005. I'm in Berkeley, California. Hold on. I'm just gonna be repositioned. I'm microphone here for a second

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,920
and

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
I'm off

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,400
Into San Francisco, 10 minutes past eight and

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
The girls are still sleeping and

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,880
I am well clearly. I'm doing much better

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,920
But also the vacation is kind of coming to an end here. Hold on. I'm sure. I'll crash. I think

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,600
As Friday, we're planning to go back and of course

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,740
part of this vacation was supposed to be a working vacation and

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,120
That part started yesterday really

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Pretty exciting

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,920
Yesterday was the first day in our office in San Francisco now. It's not our

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,040
The office that we intend to have for good

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,560
This is a temporary office, but really it was it was quite cool to have just

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,320
Everybody kind of show up all of a sudden. We have a number of folks from the East Coast

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,200
Chris McIntyre from podcast Ali got a couple of people from

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,640
We just check what I'm doing here hold on a second after the Niga okay

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,800
A couple of people from out here people from Los Angeles. So it was like there was like

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Eight people in the office yesterday

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,640
In fact, we have an office just blew me away. It was a total trip

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,400
rolled up at about eight thirty in the morning and

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
There it was coffee

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Computers folks doing stuff very very exciting

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,720
So today there's two things on the agenda

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,480
One kind of flows into the other the first one is or the

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,600
The most prevalent thing that I'm doing today is we have a an update to our board of directors

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,960
Which is you know perfect we're just getting started and

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Already we have a lot of

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
a lot of second

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm not in a good place here with my car

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,520
We've got a lot of really really really cool things that are that are going on

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,180
I don't even know half of it because I've been so out of the loop. I feel really just

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,560
It's I think that's part of what I dealt what I dislike about vacation

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,520
It's being out of the loop on on anything really and not just

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,840
Having been on vacation, but really being completely tuned out because of this flu bug that we had

37
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,500
I feel like I've missed so much and then again

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,780
I was able to catch up with a lot of stuff

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Once we got into

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Into the Claremont resort

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,640
I was able to you know catch up with a couple of shows. I listened to the most recent Gilmour gang

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,400
Last night 86 minutes. I think it's just a bit credible amount

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,000
But what's really cool about this is you know if you're a listen to the Gilmour gang

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,080
Then you know it's like a roundtable discussion and it usually lasts for about an hour

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,520
What's Steve Gilmour has been doing recently and I really like this and I hope that

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,740
By now the rest of the gang understands if that's happening is he's basically the minute everyone's on the phone

47
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,200
You know the recording's already rolling and he just

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,400
Basically puts all that out unedited as far as I know it's unedited

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:05,160
And it's it's really what it's almost what the Gilmour gang used to be where people just bitching and moaning and talking about industry stuff

50
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
But really

51
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,360
You know much less held back for some reason

52
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm not quite sure what it is about that, but it really really does work

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,400
And so they were waiting for Ron Ron Bloom to

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,200
To come on to the call so there must have been a good 20 or 25 minutes and then talk about all kinds of stuff scobal was on

55
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,520
But it's a very strong opinions about the pod show and serious

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
So you should definitely give that a listen

57
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,560
I'd say the I really like that those first 25 minutes because that was truly

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,680
People with their guard down and and it really

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,120
I don't think that any of the Gilmour gang members really listen to the show and I can't understand that

60
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,240
You know if you've you've already lived through the hour and a half that the show was and you pretty much know everything

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,120
It was said you're not gonna go back and listen to it

62
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
To the podcast more than likely

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:12,720
But I still have the feeling that a number of the gang members don't really understand that that opening bit that that first part is

64
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Also being podcast

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Maybe it's better that way because I just love listening to that

66
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
a lot of talk about pod show

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
about the

68
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,200
The interest that we receive from the investment community and not just the investment community from you know

69
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,080
Client of Perkins and Sequoia capital and Ram Shuram

70
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,920
People that we aggressively went after

71
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Because we felt that they would be the perfect team

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,320
Help us grow our vision of pod casting

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,200
Well, I'm a second now. I have to I don't want to mess this up. I don't have a my typical GPS

74
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,480
Or even a never-law's in fact this car that I'm driving is a

75
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,920
For tourists as an SE it has absolutely nothing it's white to make it even

76
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Add insult to injury

77
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,720
As no frills and I actually I kind of like it, but

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,960
Because it has no GPS. I really have to pay attention

79
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Because you know, you know me jet boy

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,320
Without the GPS, I can't function anymore. Don't tell me there's gonna be a whole bunch of traffic this morning

81
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
That was not the agreement

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,480
Shoot

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,120
Okay, well, it's like we're already in some kind of traffic

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,600
So anyway, so that board update is today and

85
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,800
You know the update is great because there's lots of stuff and lots of ideas that we have and people that you know

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,720
We'd like to get in touch with which are and investors have all the inroads to

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,000
So I know that's a big big benefit and

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Very exciting

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,480
To be moving in different circles these days got the apartment

90
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Got all that squared away yesterday

91
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,960
Got a great apartment for one. I'm here in San Francisco which will be

92
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Quite a lot. I'm sure

93
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,240
And hopefully some of the stuff that we ordered online Patricia and I did a big order

94
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,280
I think it was a JC pennies or something we ordered you know like a bed and and tables and stuff

95
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Hopefully that's going to show up

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Before we go back

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Typical JC penny

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,240
Yeah, your order is in transit. I guess we have to call someone over there and figure out what's going on

99
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
And today

100
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,320
Patricia and Christina and Ron's wife Marta are gonna go pick up some more stuff

101
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,640
Both for my apartment also for

102
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,960
For Ron and Marta's apartment because they have actually relocated here and

103
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
It's very foggy today

104
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,480
This is not what I had ordered. I told Patricia. I said it's so beautiful

105
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,360
You even have palm trees out here Northern California

106
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,000
Which is true, but man foggy and chili

107
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,520
So I can't wait to really get back into the full swing of doing

108
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
regular daily source code

109
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,200
Can understand that I have obviously been splitting up my time between

110
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,160
Well being sick first of all, but also you know being with the family you know doing stuff together

111
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,280
Which is really you know what you do what we do want to do our vacation

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,640
Despite that some work is slipping in here and there

113
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,720
And that does eat into basically all the time I spend at home on

114
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,360
Pre-producing the source code

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,720
You know, but also other stuff like the pod finder. There's a new pod finder that came out today. I hope on iTunes

116
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,680
Dave Fox

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
hosted it this week

118
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,880
I'd actually plan on doing that even though I had relinquished all of my

119
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,360
Serious satellite pod show duties to other

120
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,640
podcasters

121
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,760
I was planning on doing the pod finder myself, but obviously it just didn't feel up to it

122
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,360
So Dave Fox who is he's the guy from the

123
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,600
He's the voice of pod casting it's Adam Curry

124
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,560
So I'm very curious to see how that turned out

125
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,280
So I've really cutting all at that time

126
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,000
And obviously five in the west. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna take here

127
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,080
Yesterday it was much faster. Why is it so slow? There isn't an accident or something

128
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,800
I have no idea really what the traffic patterns are in

129
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,680
San Francisco how many people live in San Francisco is it? I mean it certainly seems like a really big city when you look at it

130
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
but

131
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
No, it's a traffic okay. Let's see

132
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
It's traffic's moving

133
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,480
But I also want to get back to you know

134
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,760
Back to just into the fray of

135
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,120
Listening to what everyone's doing again and part of that is you really do need bandwidth

136
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,440
I found that still lots of hotel

137
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
connectivity is not really

138
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Really good enough for the you know the type of subscription list that I have

139
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,680
And I'm running iTunes almost exclusively now for of the pod cast

140
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,680
I gotta say I'm pretty happy with it

141
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,000
But when you get into a a lower bandwidth situation

142
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,520
You do get broken download and you know that's really where

143
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,520
You know some of the some of the stuff starts yeah, I see buddy some of the stuff starts the fall apart

144
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Bear with me here for a second

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Trying to think if

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm gonna crash into that mini van and I think if there's anything else it's really big that's that's been happening

147
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,680
I guess the the podcast awards I saw that I I want a podcast award for

148
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Best produced podcast

149
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,600
Well, thank you very much. I presume that that is voted on by

150
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
By the audience

151
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
Was there ceremony or was there some kind of

152
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,560
Show or did just the announcements just kind of you know just appear. I was wondering about that

153
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I like award I like awards

154
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,960
I like receiving awards rarely ever received an award for anything

155
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
But I do like it to

156
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,600
To be a ceremony number the wired rave awards

157
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
When I was up for was it's a

158
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,400
New technology or something and it went to see well

159
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,920
I forget it else was in the category with me. I do know that Mark think the CEO from blog lines

160
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,080
He won that it it was like there was no ceremony

161
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,800
Yeah, you you walked in and there was a like a PowerPoint switching through slides of the nominees and the winners

162
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,440
I like a ceremony man. That's you really need to have if you're gonna do it awards

163
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,800
Anything you got him you gotta go all the way

164
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,520
So maybe there's something planned for this podcast expo which uh, what is it now?

165
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,160
They can't be that far away maybe a month or two months away

166
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,120
So now we're coming up to the toll

167
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,680
This is kind of ziplong now. I like that

168
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm not quite sure what this toll is for well obviously for some use of some

169
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Road here. I'm just trying to think what the

170
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Is it a

171
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Wonder him all up

172
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Get my cash here

173
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
There we go

174
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,680
Yeah, I see this is nice this is what New York traffic should be like

175
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Beautiful

176
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,040
Yeah, I gotta have my tunes pump and early in the morning

177
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Man my license plate is resonating with that guy's base

178
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,640
Good morning. Thank you. All right

179
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
So we're doing well then

180
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Right so Friday we'll be gone back

181
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,960
Straight from San Francisco to London and I think the in-laws who've been staying at the house

182
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,280
Are ready to go home themselves. I think they're they're bored

183
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,760
It was probably stay a couple more days. I got a call-up wing command to William because of course

184
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,080
We flew them over on the on the 182 so I want to fly him back on the 182 and if I can

185
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,240
Work in a couple more hours of flying myself that'll be great

186
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,200
It's time once again. You know by the way the Carpool tunnel syndrome whatever it's getting better

187
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
It really is this still

188
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:38,200
In my left index finger is still a little little spots of numbness and and my my thumb is almost completely better

189
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
And that's I guess really just

190
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Been through not

191
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,280
Yankees know yolks and just taking it easy so I'll be curious to see what happens when

192
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,440
When I go flying for a couple hours again see it if it well

193
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm sure I'll feel it again. I'm sure some of it will come back, but hopefully progressively over time

194
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
You know just get better

195
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,040
Because I saw was it James Woods was on

196
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,960
I think it was on Leno or on Letterman and

197
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
He had something very similar

198
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Where you know, so what happened with me is it was through the Yogiaki on the plane

199
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
While flying for that week and then of course

200
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I fell asleep on my hand in the airplane for several hours not the one that I was flying but on the way to Miami

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,640
And what he had done is he had left his his four arms in one almost one position during a poker game

202
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,560
For I think you're saying 46 hours or something like that and he actually had to have his nerve

203
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Cut out and reposition

204
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,360
Because of I guess the you know the pain and whatever the numbness, but his nerve was completely shot

205
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,680
And and I've heard lots of other people saying that you know eventually the only way you can solve this problem is through

206
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
An operation like now

207
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,120
First of all, I don't want to believe that second of all. I don't believe it. So it does seem to be getting much much better

208
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,160
Real happy about that now we're on the Bay Bridge

209
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
on the upper deck

210
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,040
which

211
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,040
This bridge has one way decks only so the

212
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:22,440
upper deck goes two surfaces go and the lower deck goes away from it and I can barely see it

213
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,040
It's all I can see the second portion of the bridge past what is it was at

214
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,280
Yerba Boina and Paradise Island kind of halfway through this bridge

215
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
It's completely in the clouds

216
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,880
That would be the foggy clouds

217
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,880
So it's I guess it's a very typical San Francisco morning

218
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,280
Then I don't know I'm gonna learn a lot more about it as I and now a new dweller of this city which I am liking very much

219
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,360
It seems like a real easy city to get around in

220
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,840
And just I don't know it's it seems convenient it seems pretty laid back

221
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,880
And it's pretty so I'm looking forward to being here a lot

222
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,120
I'm also looking forward to bringing my girls back with me

223
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,120
When when we have the apartments, I'll have our own place so they can have more of a base hang out

224
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,160
And get to know a little bit more about what's going on in the city itself because now it's you know where we're outside

225
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
And

226
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,080
So I'll probably do another quick update before we head back on Friday

227
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,360
Certainly if anything you know really cool happens

228
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,920
It seems like podcasting is just growing more every day

229
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,000
There's a I think I've said this before there's a whole new round of

230
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,920
I've pressed that is coming and that's because

231
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,440
It's still here you know podcasting is not a flash in the pan it hasn't gone away overnight

232
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,720
Publications are coming back interested in

233
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:13,160
Commercialization of podcasting interested in the glaring differences but it in a nice way between

234
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,840
Indie podcasters and mainstream podcasts

235
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,080
So there's there's plenty of opportunity for us to bring in more listeners

236
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,400
For more people to be exposed. I don't think there's a day that doesn't go by

237
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,960
That someone doesn't say send me an email saying hey, you know, I just found about this podcasting stuff

238
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Usually it's through iTunes

239
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,320
How people tune into it so I think that we're

240
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,960
We're on a very very good track at this moment and you know as we start to wind down the summer

241
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,600
I think we're gonna see a lot of things kick up

242
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Yeah

243
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,600
Oh, so I might have been my wife oops, well, I just missed it. Okay, so

244
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,120
I'm very bullish about everything that's going on and

245
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,760
Prepared to work very hard to see what we could take this

246
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,960
So as I have just about to take the free month street exit

247
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,840
We've been talking for about 20 minutes and I'll be picking up

248
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,160
Ron and Brian as we have a meeting in 930 in

249
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,120
Palo Alto

250
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,960
That's not a board update, but that's with the technology company which of course is why we're out here because if there's anything we're light on

251
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,200
You know, we know a lot about media. We don't know everything there is to know about

252
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,080
Technology and this is definitely the part of the world to come and get that so I'm gonna learn some more things today

253
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,400
And look forward to talking to you very soon as I said maybe

254
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Before we go back if not certainly on Monday as we get back into swing of

255
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,000
A brand new source code so take care y'all and I'll talk to you soon bye bye
