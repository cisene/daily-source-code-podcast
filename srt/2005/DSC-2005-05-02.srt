1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now keep in mind, and I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shirt.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yo DJ!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, yo, John McLeod!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Can we do this?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't need no sticking friends, man.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey, everybody, it is Monday, May 2nd, 2005.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The power on the door.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's really got to watch my buttons there.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm on the cast-blaster.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I hate you.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to the daily source code coming to you from the lovely and plush Ian Schrager Cliftoel

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
in San Francisco, California.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm Adam Curry, and he is your source code.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The power on the door.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So today I'm actually using the auto feature on cast-blaster on the latest data,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which I'm not quite sure how it's working,

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but at least it shouldn't be over-modulating.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The level should be okay.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm on the wireless live mic.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I've got the little box in my father-in-law,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
made hooked up to make sure that the line output,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
go to the microphone and put all the technical bits

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or put together.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And we've got a lot to talk about today.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean, echo a lot.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thanks for subscribing.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And welcome.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So right now, I got to be honest,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
my head doesn't know where my ass is and vice versa.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've been traveling so much.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We weren't really sure that we were going to come out to California.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But, you know, stuff in New York was, you know, went well

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and very interesting.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And so now we've got a couple meetings on Monday and Tuesday.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Then I'm going to head back, so I'm literally here with,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think, two pair of underwear short.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But, of course, in the fine Dutch tradition,

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you can wear them twice, right?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Inside, outside.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, man.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So yeah, I went, we got in, you see, yesterday.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And basically, I was up at like, you know, six o'clock

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
because I guess my body was already used to New York time.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I guess I'm going to, in the midst of all this,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think I skipped a day or missed 24 hours worth of something.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I'm just like, you know, the middle of the day.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I start clapping out and getting really tired.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So up here, one of the upper floors,

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you can kind of, I close the window.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Being kind of here, the rumble of the city down below.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And this is the first source code since the strategy cast,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
which boy did we learn a lot from that one, eh?

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So here's what I learned.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I learned that if you don't know what you're doing,

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
it doesn't matter how much pipe you have

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
because we essentially had 200 megabits

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
of unmetered bandwidth ready for the strategy cast.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And it certainly wasn't enough.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It just crapped out, you know?

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Which essentially, from a technical standpoint,

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
tells me that with the current state of technology

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
where we are and the way we're distributing podcasts,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you know, you need a lot of resources.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If you want to do a show that's longer than 40 minutes

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and that, you know, is something that people want to listen to.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course, you know, the theory with podcasts is that

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
your iPodor will download that during the night

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
or hopefully during some kind of off-power

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it's not everyone's trying to get to it at the same time.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But essentially, there was so much demand for the strategy cast

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that everyone was clicking on the download link

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
from curie.com and dailysourcecode.com

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and it just, it totally broke everything, which is amazing.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But it also told me a lot about how far away we are

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
from, you know, from really getting all this stuff right.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I mean, you have to know that to have 100 megabits pipe

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
just one, that's like $3,000 a month, you know, an unmeted pipe.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, you know, at this point, we have to figure some other stuff out.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Otherwise, you just can't, you know, be popular.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can't have people really wanting to listen to your stuff.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Or, of course, I want to say, well, you should have, you know,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
compressed it to lower bit rate or chopped it up into two files.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, you know, yeah, I'm not a, I'm not a technologist

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
per se, I'm a geek and hindsight.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, there's a lot of things I could have done.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But, you know, that's not really for the masses, you know,

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
if you want to create a show that's, that's, you know,

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
some time in length.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And whenever I record something in the I River, I always just kind of uploaded directly

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
from whatever the I River recorded it in.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And so there were some mistakes there.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We could have half that, by compressing it at a lower rate

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
or is it higher at a lower rate, splitting it up into multiple files,

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
all kinds of load balancing.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And, of course, everyone was talking about bit torrent,

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
which is, I really, this is something we should test.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I'm going to gladly give up the daily source code to test this.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Just don't worry.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know, how do you switch?

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, first, I don't think you really can switch.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And there's still, I'm seeing about 30% of people listening to the daily source code

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
are not coming from, from iPod or clients.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They're basically just clicking on a link on the website.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So we, you have to remove that, which I think is a mistake,

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
because you don't want anyone not to be able to get to the show.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So it's either that or having, I don't know.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I really don't know.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But how do you switch to, how do you switch your current feed to a bit torrent feed?

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You know, do you have to, you know, then we get into this,

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
oh man, we've been through this.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you use multiple enclosures?

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you post it twice?

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I mean, all stuff we got to think about.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And if you're out there and you have some ideas and some solutions,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'd love to hear about it, because it's, it's going to be challenging all this stuff.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But on the other hand, I'm incredibly excited because I've been hosting,

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
most of my stuff on dot mac and by the way, I want to thank the Apple dot mac team

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
for allowing me to eat up just tons of their bandwidth with my little dot mac account.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And they are totally letting me slide on that stuff because, you know,

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
people have been shut off and, and downloads have been crippled for much less

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
bandwidth usage in the past.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So that was extremely cool and it's really appreciated.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But man, we've, we've got some stuff to figure out.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And thank you all very much for, for the responses.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's, you know, over a hundred comments.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Most of it about the, the download and that was tough.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And of course, once that got fixed, and a lot of interesting comments on the,

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
on the weblog itself.

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And lots and lots of email, lots of people checking in, lots of people with interest.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I really appreciate it.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And it's just the beginning of God knows where this is all going to take us.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I'm very, very excited about it.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's see.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I wrote a couple of things down.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, first of all, on the way out on the plane, I was listening to, you know,

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
my regular download of podcasts.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And Rock and Roll Geek, Michael Butler, Rock and Roll Geek.com,

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
had the most awesome podcast.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He did it with one of the, I think there's a guitar tech or

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
well, one of the road crew for currently, who's on the Wieser tour

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
went to his hotel room.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This guy has his own podcast.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a bit of a man.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I should have written that down.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hold on a second.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let me see if Rock and Roll Geek put that on the show notes.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hold on a second.

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Bit of a man's square and bit of a parking.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, yeah, man.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Rock and Roll Geek.com.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I've got the, this hotel that I'm in, which is a,

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it's a great hotel that's really funky and it's almost

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
screaming for a sound seeing tour.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They only have a wired internet connection.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now I have my Mac and the, and the, the tablet with me,

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
of course, I'm recording this on on the data of Cast Blaster.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So what I do is I plug the wired connection into my Mac and then use

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that to basically become a base, a base station.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, shoot.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why is this not working?

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, I hate this.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, here we go.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's see.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's going to be in here in this show notes.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, right.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even took pictures.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Cool.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, Aaron.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Aaron.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Bit of a man's circle podcast.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There you go.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's what it was.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Bit of a man's circle.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
B-it-t-e-r-m-a-n-c-i-r-c-l-e.com.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you want to hear a great podcast that's coming from the road as,

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
you know, really to get an idea of what's going on behind the scenes,

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
right now on the Weezer tour.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a great podcast to listen to.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And Michael's podcast with him was just fantastic.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Learned a lot, actually, and they played some cool tunes.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And see, and then we got in.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This wacky hotel, which has, you know, Ian Schreger is,

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I guess he's a designer.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He designs the wackiest furniture.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And some of it's completely oversized, like huge, like,

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
chrome-sized chairs and the restaurant.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All different sizes and all very, you know, kind of like gothic,

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
yet also classic and colonial and all kinds of styles

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
mixed through each other curtains with light shining down.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And it's just an awesome hotel.

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And all the beautiful people in San Francisco are all hanging out here.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's so wonderful.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hi, everyone. My name is Zoe.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And this is my wife, C. Hello.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We need to tell you in about 30 seconds about a new,

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
slightly different show called the Shonapodcast.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The Shonapodcast with Cecilia and Zy.

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
www.Shonapodcast.co.uk.

204
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Shonapodcast is a language spoken by over 8 million people in Zimbabwe

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and it's a running territories and buys Zimbabwe's all over the world.

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And since I already speak it, Zy is going to be learning it.

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you're interested in foreign languages,

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
or perhaps you know someone from Zimbabwe,

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and would like to learn some Shonap, then you should enjoy listening to the Shonapodcast.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
In each episode, we introduce a few Shonawatts,

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and we often talk about Zimbabwe music, culture, and traditions,

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and even current affairs with Zimbabwe hits the headlines.

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Please visit our website and have a listen to the show at www.shonapodcast.co.uk.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's s-h-o-n-a-podcast.co.uk.

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If you subscribe to our feed, you find out why we're making the Shonapodcast,

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
why we sound so different,

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and why Zay has simply got to learn some Shonapodcast.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Alrighty, the Shonapodcast.

219
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And this Windows machine is really freaking me out.

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So, the second one is connected to my computer now,

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
all of a sudden, why does Windows do that?

222
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why does it keep trying to connect to different wireless networks?

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, I'm connected to the city-net public with very low signal strength.

224
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't get it.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay.

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thanks for all the feedback on the cast-blaster data.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now that we've sent our data as yet,

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the people are still responding to the daily source code created with the application.

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I'm using the auto feature now,

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
which essentially, because all these different promos and pod safe music

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and the hit tests are all recorded at different levels,

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
this really does do a lot of the auto-leveling,

233
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
but then the minute you hit talk,

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
it's going to kind of duck the,

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's called auto ducking,

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
D-U-C-T-I-N-G.

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It kind of fades down the music so you can talk over it.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, it gives a little, like, a more choppy or mix

239
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
when I turn the mic on and off,

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
but, well, that's a Tesla, see how it goes.

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
One of the meetings I had in New York,

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I wanted to tell you about with one or music group.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This was the weirdest freaking meeting I've ever been in.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was cool because there were technologies from W-M-G there,

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but there was also, you know, some vice-president guys

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
who were more on the, you know, the digital delivery side

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
of the Warner Music Group.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now, there really only four record companies left,

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
of which W-M-G is one of them.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And we had talked to one of the big cheeses over there

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
on the phone, like a week and a half or two weeks ago,

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and, you know, we're basically talking about pod safe music

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and how, you know, how promoting cool songs

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and bands is back with podcasts, right?

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Where you hear something you like,

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you play it on your podcast, you have permission

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
as a pod safe tune,

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and you can get people excited about it.

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And as we've seen with the Sylvia's Bitties,

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you know, people turn out to actually want to buy the record.

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, we think that's a very interesting model,

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and we're going to be doing a lot of that with the CC Chapman.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We're calling the pod safe music network,

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and you'll be hearing more about that in the next week or two,

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
of course, podshow.com is where you can stay up to speed,

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and of course, we'll be talking about it here on the source code.

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But we finally got down to actually making the real suggestion.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And the suggestion, I told them exactly what I do.

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know, like, I go to iTunes Music Store,

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I purchase a song, and then I play it,

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and I would gladly pay instead of 99 cents.

272
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Excuse me, I would gladly pay five bucks.

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You know, put a little, you know, on the back catalog,

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
right, we're not talking about, you know, the J-Lo's

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and all the new million platinum selling records.

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We're talking about the back catalog,

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
which probably doesn't sell all that much,

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but is available in the iTunes Music Store.

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know, like Chicago Saturday in the park that I played,

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and we said, well, why don't you,

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you know, make a feature in iTunes Music Store,

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
or, you know, obviously at the set up that relationship with Apple,

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
wherever you buy your songs from,

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you know, if it has a green star after it,

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that means you can, you play this on your podcast,

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and when you download it,

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
you essentially would pay five bucks, five bucks,

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and that would be sufficient for you to play this on your podcast.

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And that would, by the way,

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
because then it would be treated as a digital download,

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and I'm starting to become almost like a lawyer now.

292
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You wouldn't have to pay AskCap or BMI,

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and the artist would get theoretically,

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
would get a piece of that in the publisher.

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And of course, the author, the composer.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They didn't get it.

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Literally said, well, yeah, we think that would be very interesting.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I remember this is five times the normal sale price,

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
five times.

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That would be great,

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
but then they said, well, still,

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
we don't want that MP3 to be in the clear longer than two weeks.

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So your podcast would essentially, and literally,

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I said, would have to disintegrate.

305
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You know, like, it would have to blow up,

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and couldn't be kept online for longer than two weeks.

307
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So you totally missing it.

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And by the way, when you play it,

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
your podcast that goes down to a much lower bit rate,

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
it's much less high quality,

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and you're probably mixing it with talk,

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
or whatever you're talking over the intro we can with.

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know, everything we've talked about on the source code,

314
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
we suggested, and they just said,

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
no, you know, we feel that you still have to,

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
you know, make it go away.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You can't, as they say, and this is the phrase

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
it's stuck in my mind.

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We don't want MP3s in the clear.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And it was so disappointing, you know,

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and if I were, you know, Peter Saterra,

322
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
or any of the guys from Chicago, which we use as an example,

323
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I would be fucking pissed off.

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You know, here's a chance to make a quintuple sale,

325
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
quintuple on one that's half the price of the CD,

326
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for just letting me play it on the podcast,

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and the record company is turning it down.

328
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Absolutely mind boggling.

329
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now, on the other hand,

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the technologists who were in the room,

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've had a real nice kind of offline conversation with them,

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and they are doing some interesting things,

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but now you got to think that if the top is thinking that way,

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
we're just not going to get very far with this stuff,

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which is really quite a shame.

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I had them.

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm glad you allowed me to approach your giant microphone

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to promote the Pirates Week.

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I use the pseudonym Ragnar Danjold,

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
while I'm letting my vacuum tubes cool

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and try this podcasting thing.

342
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Although it's not real entertaining,

343
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'd like to think I'm helping the shortwave pirate radio community

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
by relating logs, news items,

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and technical information for the Pirate Radio

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
DX and hobby with my podcast.

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
A hobby cast, if you will.

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I tend to stick to North American shortwave

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and some mediumwave pirates,

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but everyone's so well,

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
a Euro Pirate makes the leap across the pond

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
to be logged by a lucky few.

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So here's my 32nd promo.

354
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'd be honored to be included in your litany of the undeserved

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The Pirates Week.

356
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay, now I get it.

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's why I sent two files.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
One is the intro,

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and then one is the actual promo.

360
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry about that.

361
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'll play that tomorrow on the show.

362
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll get the second promo going.

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's funny though,

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
because I used to be a,

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I guess, yeah,

366
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
basically a shortwave pirate.

367
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When we had, I'll back in the day man,

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
you had CB radio,

369
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
which of course you had the 40,

370
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the 40 channel CB radio,

371
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but then you had something called SSB single side band,

372
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the LSB, the lower side band,

373
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and then USB, the upper side band,

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
which effectively gave you 80 more channels to play with.

375
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And what we had figured out with all these,

376
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
solid state logic CB radios

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
is that you could snip a diode

378
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that was connected to one of the chip sets,

379
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that would expand with another 120 channels,

380
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
only in an upper range.

381
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So CB is like 27 megahertz,

382
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and this would basically take you the 28 megahertz band.

383
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And that's officially a ham radio band,

384
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but it was really quiet there,

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
because of course there are not a lot of people

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
who would jack their box to make it do that.

387
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But I remember just with a regular CB radio,

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
which on side band,

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and this is a little geeky detail,

390
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I would output like 12 watts, peak envelope power,

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that I was talking to people in Ohio from Amsterdam.

392
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You know, I had an antenna on my roof,

393
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and as I actually there was a group called the KMG,

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
which was the Kiss My Grits group group,

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and some of those guys had huge six foot antennas

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
on the back of their car,

397
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and they'd be driving around Ohio,

398
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and I could actually talk to them

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
if the conditions were good from all the way from Amsterdam,

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and it was quite a trip.

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I am kind of a little bit of a short wave

402
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
part of myself from way way back.

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So the thing that didn't happen in New York,

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
which I'm bummed about,

405
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
is the Paris Hilton interview.

406
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Reason for it,

407
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
believe it or not,

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
she has a new PR firm.

409
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And the new PR firm said,

410
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
well, we're really trying to limit

411
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the amount of promotion that Paris is doing for the movie,

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and I was like, you fucking idiot.

413
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Basically what it means is whenever you hire a new PR firm,

414
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
the first thing they do is they discredit everything

415
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
the old PR firm had set up,

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
say, oh no, we're not going to do that,

417
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that's a bad idea.

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So these people really didn't do their homework, I feel.

419
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And it's quite a shame because Paris's podcast

420
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
could definitely use a boost,

421
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and I wanted to give her some feedback.

422
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The first show was out there.

423
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I haven't heard the second one yet.

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It sounded to me like she did a little intro

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that she probably did cut in the green room somewhere

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
at David Letterman.

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And then basically they took the audio from,

428
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I guess a TV documentary,

429
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
or maybe it's the House of Wax show on MTV

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that they're doing.

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So that's a shame.

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It could have been better and quite honestly,

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I had a whole bunch of good questions,

434
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
including Mads Weinstein's,

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
which I did not get to ask.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Wanna get to know Paris?

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Two men to the Paris Hilton podcast now.

438
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's the Paris Hilton podcast.

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Been 24-7 with Paris Hilton

440
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
on her countdown to the House of Wax.

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's right.

442
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
All Paris, all the time.

443
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
To give Paris Hilton podcasts,

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
go to www.houseamwaxmovie.com

445
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and click on the podcast link.

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, if you'd actually do some of your own stuff,

447
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Paris, you know, just talk to us for a little bit.

448
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's what you want.

449
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And I know you're listening to the daily source code.

450
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Just talk to us, just sit somewhere,

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and you room, you hotel room on the plane,

452
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and whatever.

453
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And just let us know what's going on in your life.

454
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Although I did kind of like the behind-the-scenes stuff,

455
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and I wouldn't mind if it was a little bit longer,

456
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but too bad.

457
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Too bad.

458
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I guess David Letterman's still

459
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
still rates much, much higher than me.

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh no.

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What evil work?

462
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
In the heart of men.

463
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The shadow, no.

464
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Come down for blast off.

465
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
X minus 4 minus 3 minus 2 X minus 1.

466
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey, Adam.

467
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We've heard you podcast.

468
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We're talking about old radio dummies,

469
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
such as the Green Hornet.

470
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We'd like to invite you to check out our podcast.

471
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Bautar's old-time radio.

oh,

487
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
oh,

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
oh,

489
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
oh,

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
oh,

491
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
oh,

492
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
oh,

493
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
oh,

494
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
oh,

495
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
oh,

496
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
oh,

497
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
oh,

498
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
oh,

499
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
oh,

500
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
oh,

501
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
oh,

502
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
oh,

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
oh,

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
oh,

505
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
oh,

506
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
oh,

507
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
be a suit, it is pot-shape.

508
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Awesome, dude.

509
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,200
I really enjoyed this podcast.

510
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,900
I mean, we can learn a lot from it, actually.

511
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,700
And yeah, I think it is actually pot-safe.

512
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,000
That's deemed as pot-safe is probably in the, uh,

513
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
uh, what do you call it?

514
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,700
It's, uh, in the public domain, uh, by now,

515
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,200
really cool to hear some of that old stuff.

516
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,500
And, actually, I got a couple of ideas,

517
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,000
and I was listening to it.

518
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,700
All right, time to some pot-safe tunes.

519
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,700
Um, this is, uh, I've actually played a song

520
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
by, uh, out of warranty before.

521
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
I remember I told you the story about the,

522
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
the original bass player for Wild Cherry,

523
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,200
the more Wild Cherry play that funky music.

524
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,700
He sent me another tune,

525
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
and it was especially the beginning of the song

526
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
that really struck me.

527
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Uh, listen close.

528
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Here's, I don't have.

529
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
I don't have a flash.

530
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
He flash with scent.

531
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,700
I don't have a laptop or a plug.

532
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,700
I don't even have a plug to listen.

533
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
But I'm going to...

534
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,700
I just barely made the downtown transmit.

535
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
All my changes were laying down the aisle.

536
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Everyone is looking at me cross-eyed

537
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,700
as I drop the floor to steal my smile.

538
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Oh, it's a beautiful tunnel, right?

539
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Got a wonderful knit-town sightseeing.

540
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,700
It's all over my mind, tune-like.

541
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
I'm burning brighter than the city lights.

542
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Now I don't have a fancy foreign sportscar.

543
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,700
I don't have the latest anything.

544
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I just want to get to her this evening,

545
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,700
so we can enjoy this little thing.

546
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Is it a serious relationship?

547
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Only time will tell me if it's real.

548
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Love or just not feeling over hands,

549
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
and with fingertips across my...

550
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Oh, it's a beautiful town, tune-like.

551
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,700
From the bridge I have a lovely sightseeing.

552
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,700
It's a vision and a pair of jeans.

553
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Like a movie or a man.

554
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Oh, it's a beautiful town, tune-like.

555
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,700
From the bridge I have a lovely sightseeing.

556
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,700
It's a vision and a pair of jeans.

557
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Like a movie or a man.

558
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I don't have a Rolex or a diamond.

559
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I don't have a TV-level seats.

560
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
I can't drink that fancy cam,

561
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
but she ain't no.

562
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,700
I need to put some shoes from my feet.

563
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Well, I don't have a flashy glass website.

564
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I don't have a laptop or a hub.

565
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I don't even have a clock to listen.

566
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,700
But at least I'm sure of love.

567
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm sure of love.

568
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Yeah, stick it in your ear.

569
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
I don't have out of warranty.

570
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Love that.

571
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Don't have a flashy flashy website.

572
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Don't have a laptop or a pod.

573
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
I don't even have a pod.

574
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
Was it pod to piss in?

575
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
I've been just whistling that tune all day.

576
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,700
I took a walk after breakfast or kind of brunch today.

577
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,700
And a CC Chapman sent me a couple of podsafe tunes to listen to and play on the source code.

578
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
I just couldn't get this one out of my head.

579
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
So I want to play that for you.

580
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,700
And out of warranty, as far as I know, actually doesn't have a website.

581
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,700
So as maybe if they do, I'll get that info and I just haven't seen it in the emails or

582
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
or found it anywhere.

583
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Of course, I'll put it up in the show notes.

584
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,700
And that's one of the things that we're going to really,

585
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
really make possible for the podsafe music network.

586
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
So that could say, go check this out, the podsafe music network.

587
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
There'll be info about the artist.

588
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,700
You could see important for podcasters, of course,

589
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,700
is what's being played a lot on different podcasts.

590
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,700
And of course, you'll be able to link to buy the CDA.

591
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
And if I have my drill, there's if we can figure that out.

592
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,700
Also to download it and buy it digitally, I guess.

593
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
So looking forward to a lot of cool new music coming on to the scene.

594
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
I tell you that.

595
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Let me see what else they have on my list for today.

596
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Oh yeah.

597
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
So of course, we announced our pod squad,

598
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,700
who invested in really investing the creativity and talent of a number of great podcasters.

599
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,700
And by the way, that means that we're literally helping them financially

600
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,700
through a number of different ways so that they can, you know,

601
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,700
take, you know, basically spend the time on creating podcasts.

602
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,700
And we've created production companies with them,

603
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,700
so that they can start to produce more podcasts with other other people

604
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,700
who may be need production or have a great idea.

605
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,700
And there's just all kinds of cool things that are going to be coming up

606
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
very soon.

607
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,700
And one of them I'm very excited about is Steve Gilmore.

608
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
He will be bringing the Gilmore gang back,

609
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,700
which means our weekends will be complete again.

610
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,700
And also a new feature, Gilmore Daily.

611
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,700
And I just sent him, he got a,

612
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
he now has a tablet and I just set him up with

613
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,700
a date of cast blaster and immediately he's got all kinds of ideas

614
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
how he can make it even better.

615
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,700
If you haven't heard yet from us about the cast blaster beta,

616
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
it's probably going to be another,

617
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I think another week until we actually send the date is out.

618
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,700
And then it should be, I think no more than two or three weeks of

619
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,700
testing until we can open up to a public beta and everyone can enjoy.

620
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,700
At least, I'm sorry to say anyone with an XP,

621
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,700
when those XP can enjoy, I wish we could do it for the Mac,

622
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,700
but then again, you know, Mac people are already so incredibly

623
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,700
privileged with the machine they have.

624
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Hi Adam, I'm glad you allowed me to approach your giant microphone.

625
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Wait a minute.

626
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
Wait a minute, we already did that one.

627
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm sorry, this is the one I wanted to play for you.

628
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Hello, I'm Thomas Vanhoff, a journalist and a podcast of

629
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,700
from Germany.

630
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,700
I started podcasting in October 2004,

631
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
first with summerstellet.net about potsafe music from Germany.

632
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Then in January 2005, I started Vanhoff's wonderful world of science.

633
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,700
The German science podcast.

634
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,700
With Nicole Simon and Garrett von Arken, I found it's sushi radio DE.

635
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Some tidbits of podcasting.

636
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,700
This is one of the most popular shows in Germany.

637
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Because I am listening so much to English spoken podcasts

638
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
and for improving my English,

639
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,700
I decided to develop an international edition of my science podcast.

640
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
And here it is.

641
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,700
A new star is born in podcast heaven.

642
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Sciencecast.net.

643
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Every Sunday evening on the net on sciencecast.net.

644
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
What's in the show?

645
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Science news from all over the world.

646
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Sometimes fresh reports when I'm in the wild.

647
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,700
Some sound seeing and some funny things.

648
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
So have fun with it.

649
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Enjoy the show and send me comments on mail.

650
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,700
At sciencecastmail at gmail.com.

651
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Sciencecast.net.

652
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,700
Every Sunday, the latest news from the world of science.

653
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
All right, totally dig that.

654
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Of course, summerstellet.net has been around.

655
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
One of the early podcasts.

656
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
And of course coming from Germany.

657
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
It was a funny.

658
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
It doesn't sound a little bit like the Pope.

659
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Just a teeny, tiny bit.

660
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Okay.

661
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,700
So here's a sign for a dam announcement.

662
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
This is a cool one.

663
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
I'm very excited about this.

664
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,700
No more than two weeks ago.

665
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:36,700
We were talking about the concept of an open podcast.org idea on satellite.

666
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Where would be great to have a channel where we could expose more people

667
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,700
to podcasting.

668
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,700
And depending on when you're listening to this podcast, you may or may not have heard the news

669
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:57,700
that Pod Show has struck a deal with serious satellite radio to bring you four hours of podcasting

670
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,700
every single day.

671
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,700
And I am so jazzed about this because now we're talking in audience of almost two million people.

672
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:13,700
And these guys are working their ass off to get more and more subscribers to serious satellite radio.

673
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,700
They're looking at probably 20 million by 2007 or whatever.

674
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
And it's gone.

675
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,700
You know, every single new car that is sold in the states now, I think, has either the option

676
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
or it's standard.

677
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,700
You have a satellite receiver in there.

678
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Well, we did it.

679
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Yeah, I put in a couple of calls.

680
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I told you about that on a previous daily source code.

681
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
And there was definitely interest.

682
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Now, these guys, of course, they only have so many channels.

683
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Yeah, it's like 150 channels.

684
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
But they only have so many.

685
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,700
And there's all kinds of stuff already on the Tony Hawk M&M.

686
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,700
The Howard Stern will soon be on serious satellite or at the end of the year,

687
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,700
and now we have the pod show on serious satellite radio.

688
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,700
And I am so freaking jazzed about this because, first of all, we're going to open it up,

689
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,700
so that anyone can consent in your podcast or your promo.

690
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,700
I mean, it's seen this really as a huge daily source code,

691
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,700
which is actually it's quite a, it's a big task to put this together.

692
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:25,700
But I've been very lucky to be able to team up with PW Fenton from the digital

693
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Flotsom.org.

694
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,700
He does, I've talked about his podcast a lot.

695
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,700
And he just really knows how to do audio.

696
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
So he's going to be working with me on that.

697
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,700
He's going to be really doing all the production.

698
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,700
And we're going to open up a couple of ways for you to send in your,

699
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,700
your promos, your podcasts, whatever it is, and check this out.

700
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,700
I'm going to put all kinds of mashups in there, pod safe music.

701
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,700
If you have a podcast where you play licensed music,

702
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,700
not a problem because serious satellite's going to pick up the tab for that.

703
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,700
So, you know, you could do whatever you want,

704
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,700
and we're going to put it on serious satellite network,

705
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
which will be, I think it's, well,

706
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
I guess we start all the way at the end of the spectrum, right?

707
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,700
We're on channel 148.

708
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
But we did it.

709
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,700
We really did it.

710
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
And I'm extremely excited.

711
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,700
It's going to be a shitload of work, but it's going to be awesome.

712
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,700
So, in the next couple of days, I'll have details on how you can submit your podcast.

713
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,700
And, and of course, you know, the whole point is to promote your podcast.

714
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,700
So, make sure that if you're thinking about submitting something that there's a way for people to

715
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:43,700
subscribe to, you want to give out your URL and where your, where your podcast feed is.

716
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,700
And also, I'm going to try and,

717
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,700
what we don't go with doing the source code and try and get more listeners for podcasts.

718
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,700
And also turn more people onto podcasting.

719
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,700
And it's going to be a great place for people to sample podcasts.

720
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,700
And I think starting off with four hours, which, of course,

721
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
I'd like to move to a 24 hour channel,

722
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,700
but let's start off slowly and see how the submissions go.

723
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
And if we can get enough content in there to fill it up.

724
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,700
I'm pretty sure, as we grow, it'll work.

725
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
But I am very, very excited.

726
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,700
I did want to thank Steve Leads for, for basically, you know, setting it all up.

727
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Steve is the guy, and I've talked about this with Ken Clarke on the MTV Chronicles.

728
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,700
He's the guy that called me in 1987 when I was in, in the Netherlands and said,

729
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
hey, you want to come and work for MTV.

730
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
And he's the same guy hooked up.

731
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,700
The, the serious satellite radio deal.

732
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,700
I have a picture on serious satellite radio.

733
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Totally jazzed about it.

734
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,700
This is your captain speaking.

735
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Yo DJ, are you done mixing it?

736
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
If so, please invest in your league belt,

738
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
they hit this to the back to take off.

739
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
The hell is this?

740
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Oh, they're casting with...

741
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
I'm curious.

742
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
It's a great deal.

743
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
It's time for the hit test.

744
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,700
With y'all, pull it.

745
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
All right.

746
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Hey, Adam.

747
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
This is Y'all Paulette with another hit test,

748
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
and this one's a bit different because I'm still on a Skype call

749
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
with the hit test announcer guy.

750
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
The hit test.

751
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,700
That is not included.

752
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Battery sold separately.

753
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Hey Kevin, I doing...

754
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Good John.

755
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
John.

756
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Okay.

757
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Can I have a birthday soon?

758
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Really?

759
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Gonna be 42.

760
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
42 man.

761
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,700
You're getting old.

762
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I'm gonna be ready for the concert.

763
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Thank you.

764
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
I'll have to get this.

765
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Well, of course you know me.

766
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
I'm too cheap to send you anything across the big ocean,

767
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,700
called the Atlantic.

768
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
But how about this?

769
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
How about a few?

770
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
All right.

771
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Just like the music for the next hit test for Adam.

772
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Me?

773
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Yeah, you.

774
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
How many do I get?

775
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
How about 10?

776
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Well, I guess he, uh,

777
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
he'll only do three.

778
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Three. Okay.

779
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
But of course, that's one rule.

780
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Adam is supposed to know them.

781
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
So they have to have been hit somewhere in the,

782
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
in my lifetime.

783
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
60, 70s or 80s.

784
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Exactly.

785
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
My life, sir.

786
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Yeah, hit to the 70s and 80s.

787
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Okay.

788
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Or the 90s.

789
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
But then they can only be American hits.

790
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Okay.

791
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Those are the rules.

792
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Are you up for it?

793
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
I'm up for it.

794
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Okay.

795
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Let's do it.

796
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
Well, Adam, um,

797
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,700
what is the same as always is that I've got three clips lined up.

798
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
And this is clip and intro.

799
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Number one.

800
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Sounds like.

801
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Ten and ten.

802
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Keep on moving.

803
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Two.

804
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Something like that.

805
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
Absolutely.

806
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
No clue what that is.

807
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
This is, uh, tough.

808
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Y'all.

809
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,700
And the final one is a bit short.

810
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
This is number three.

811
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
What?

812
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,700
All right.

813
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Just give me the answers.

814
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
I suck.

815
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
There's no way I get any of those.

816
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
You're probably yelling at your iPod, right?

817
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
So up.

818
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
This is answer number one.

819
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
It's sold to sold.

820
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
I have that one.

821
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
It's sold.

822
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
It's sold.

823
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
It's sold.

824
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
It's sold.

825
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
It's sold.

826
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
It's sold.

827
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
It's sold.

828
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
It's sold.

829
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
My name'schoice.

830
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
Your name'schoice, my name'schoice.

831
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
My name'schoice.

832
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
Put the word down the chair.

833
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,700
So you got it.

834
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Hey.

835
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
shortcut.

836
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
See your guy there.

837
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
Oh, for tips.

838
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:43,100
The answer number one in today's hit-est, so to solve and keep on moving and it's recorded

839
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,100
from vinyl and it's great to hear those correctly sounds again.

840
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,620
Answer number one and this is answer number two.

841
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:58,420
It's from 89, so I hope you know this one, the stone roses, this is full skulls.

842
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
I wouldn't have known that one.

843
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,420
I think I've ever heard the song before.

844
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
The stone roses, answer number two.

845
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,420
I hope this has been a hit in the United States also because else you won't know what this one is.

846
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Fulls gold, answer number two and this is answer number three.

847
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,420
The easiest one also to share the split, but there's the easiest one.

848
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Sting and Englishman in New York.

849
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Of course.

850
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,420
Well if you knew that one at home.

851
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Being an Englishman in New York, answering number three in today's hit-est.

852
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,420
And I'm already looking forward to the next one.

853
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,420
I hope Kevin, you will do a great job searching for music.

854
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Looking forward to it, you're on.

855
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Okay, well see you next time.

856
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,420
Well Adam, thank you for playing this one.

857
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Thank you.

858
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,420
Yes, time for another edition of the hit-est.

859
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,420
And of course, as always, hit-est at gmail.com is the address for feedback and the web address is

860
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
www.yompolet.nl or.com.

861

That's J-A-N-B-O-L-E-T.nl or.com.

862
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,420
And you can find all information about hit-est and the separate hit-est podcast on that page.

863
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Well thank you for listening, see you next time.

864
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Bye-bye.

865
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,420
All right, John, thank you very much.

866
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,420
Oh, yeah, Kevin, thank you too.

867
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,420
But again, the hit-test.

868
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,420
And that is it for the Daily Source Code for the second of me.

869
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,420
And I'm going to see what time is it now.

870
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,420
It's so, man, I'm going to have some dinner over here.

871
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,420
Okay, thanks again for checking out the Daily Source Code.

872
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,420
A lot of exciting stuff we had to talk about today.

873
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,420
And I'm sure there'll be more in the coming few weeks.

874
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,420
So you want to stay subscribed.

875
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,420
Okay, you can find the podcast feed at dailysourcecode.com.

876
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,420
Feedback to atomacuri.com.

877
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,420
If you want to send me a promo, don't send me the MP3 file.

878
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Just send a link to an MP3 file.

879
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Put in the subject's DFC promo.

880
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,420
If you got pod safe tunes for me, put pod safe music in the subject line.

881
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,420
So I can route all that to the proper folders.

882
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,420
And of course, you can always leave a comment on my weblog www.curry.com.

883
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,420
Thanks again for listening. Have a great week, y'all. Bye-bye.

884
00:40:51,420 --> 00:41:01,420
Bye-bye.
