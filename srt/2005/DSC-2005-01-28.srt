Daily source code 1-28-2005

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,680
Get ready for the generation of rock-and-roll

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,680
Look, Jessica, it's Adam Curry

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,080
Hey everybody, thank God it's Friday. This is your daily source code

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,880
2-28-2004

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,880
Almost one month down

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,080
My God, it's going fast, how you doing?

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
It is 11 o'clock in the morning

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,600
I'm doing these shows a little bit earlier

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,320
for the past week, enjoying that a lot

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,800
because it just kind of get cranking

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,080
And once again today, filled with promos, trivia, pot-safe music

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,720
I did something very interesting, normally when I do the show

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,840
I've got to take all my, you've got to get everything ready

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,320
and sometimes I'll even spark up enough to be completely ready

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,520
and normally I either have coffee or tea

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,120
I kind of depends on the mood or how I'm feeling

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,960
and what I've had earlier in the morning

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,600
because I am either a tea-toe blur or, you know, I'm a coffee-toe blur, I guess

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,040
and we have the Senseo coffee machine that I've talked about

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,040
the one when we put those little pads in and close the lid

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,800
So I've got confused, because we also have tea bags

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,080
and in the UK, a proper tea bag of course

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,280
does not have a string, you should know that

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,400
So there's not much difference really if you look at a tea bag or a coffee pot

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,480
So I'm sitting there and I'd mindlessly taking my coffee pot or pad for the Senseo

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,840
and it was just dipping that around in my cup like it was tea

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,720
and then I, you know, sugar didn't sweeten it up and got the milk in there

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,840
and I just sat down, ready to do the show and took a big swing

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,480
thinking it was tea, that's wacky

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,080
that is definitely an experience all to do it self

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,040
The results are in, yesterday we did the first episode of the MTV Chronicles

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,960
I would have to say 97% of the daily source code listeners really enjoyed it

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:19,800
would love to hear more of that but maybe as a, as a feature that pops up once every, every so often

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,920
probably not a lot of people would want to listen to that as a separate podcast feed

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,720
but it was interesting because of the 3% that really really did not like it

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,080
almost 100% of those 3% were from Canada and as I got to think about it

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,600
it probably makes a lot of sense because if you don't know who the hell we're talking about

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,320
then you know who's going to care and of course Canada at the time had much

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,560
of course they still have much music which was not only in direct competition

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,520
with MTV because MTV of course never really made it

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,920
I don't think it was available in Canada, maybe it still isn't

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,880
Canada is pretty tied about you know there are cultural influences from outside

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,600
and that's how I want you to explain that to me I think it's very similar to France where

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,040
radio stations have to play a certain percentage of national music which is really good I think

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,800
it's a good idea particularly well I don't know if they have public broadcasting

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,520
yeah of course they have public broadcasting in Canada you look at the Netherlands where

48
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,240
Dutch music which is not my favorite music just gets no play zero there's no industry

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,800
there's one one or two guys and they make all their money in Germany because Dutch and German is

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,800
very similar and of course the tunes are a great and popular in people like them but for some

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,080
reason it just gets no play there's also no rules about that anyway I digress so not everyone

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,640
liked it I certainly had a good time I think well maybe we'll do that on weekends or something like

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,560
that we'll do something special I have a lot more to talk about with Ken and there's a lot more

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,600
stories and I'm sure he's working on probably finding snippets of video or stuff that

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
maybe we can play on the show if I know Ken he's he's doing that one thing that did come

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,840
up though we were talking about Martha Quinn and we're trying to come up with who did the

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,960
stuff and Martha's muffin track and I was we couldn't quite remember while we were doing the

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,080
show I was thinking it was like George Thurgood or George Sadlites I knew I was pretty close because

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,240
a couple people actually mentioned this in the comments on the weblog that it was Mojo Nixon

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,080
Mojo Nixon excuse me that's the coffee Mojo Nixon in Skid Roper and Rich Graham was friendly enough

61
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,440
to send along an original MP3 stuff in Martha's muffin here's Mojo Nixon yeah man I know y'all be

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:50,600
checking out on WMTV there and you see Mojo you're next in Skid Roper on MTV no sorry man I gotta

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,920
do something about this I called him up man I called him MTV in New York and I said oh yo this

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Mojo Nixon got speak to Martha Quinn they said Martha Quinn yeah here she is hello Mojo this

65
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,880
this is this is Martha Quinn we're gonna do for you I said Martha maybe how am I gonna get on

66
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,240
MTV she said Mojo you're too nasty you're too you're always talking about masturbation

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,640
and fun occasion you're never gonna get on MTV that way Mojo I said oh Martha I said Martha Quinn

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,560
I want to be doing some sin with your Martha Quinn I want to be getting in Martha Quinn I said I want to be

69
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
mother my

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,740
my

71
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,020
yeah

72
00:05:51,020 --> 00:06:00,020
All right, 1986 okay, all across the U.S.N.A.

Hot tub!

75
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
All right, brothers and sisters, friends of the revolution.

76
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,020
We're gonna do right here, little singing, little calling response, a little sing along.

77
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,020
A little assays, and you say it, a little repeat after me.

78
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Here we go!

79
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020

98
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Yeah, Mojo Nixon and Skidrobras,

99
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
stuff in Martha's Muffin on your daily source code.

100
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
And a couple of dropouts in that song.

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,760
A lot of people mentioned that happened yesterday during

102
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
the talk that I had with Ken.

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
I think, I don't know what it is,

104
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
but there's something about it seems to me

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,760
like the hard disk of Mac computers

106
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,760
that something just gets confused

107
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
if you're doing a lot of heavy audio processing.

108
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Like you can start out using GarageBand.

109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
I hear Don and do talk about this all the time.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
You can start out, or even match has problems now

111
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
with GarageBand.

112
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Once you start using it,

113
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
then it's like your Mac gets sick after a while

114
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
and then it starts delaying latency crops up

115
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
you get weird feedback.

116
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,760
I'm using audio hijack pro, which has been great for me.

117
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I think here's what happened yesterday because we recorded

118
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,760
the MTV Chronicles Ken and I on Wednesday evening.

119
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,760
And I recorded the way I normally record the source code

120
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
as an AIFF.

121
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,760
I post compressed the MP3 after I've done

122
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
after I've done recording the show.

123
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
The reason why I do that is AIFF is

124
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
it's not a compressed format.

125
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
So if something crashes, which has been known to happen

126
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,760
at least I'll have all of the file that was already recorded.

127
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,760
If you're doing it, if you're recording to MP3

128
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,760
with compression, then usually you lose everything

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
that you just recorded and all your work has gone.

130
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Additionally, your computer has to work a lot harder.

131
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,760
You need a lot more CPU processing power

132
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
to do that on the fly.

133
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,760
And audio hijack pro has a little warning system there

134
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
when you're recording directly

135
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
that MP3, it'll say, oh, skipping.

136
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,760
So it wasn't the skipping of the encoding.

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I think what was happening is because it was reading

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,760
in this, what is it? Like 500 megabyte file

139
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,760
as I was playing that back because I put the head

140
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,760
and the end onto the show yesterday morning.

141
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
So I started off the show, then hit play on this file

142
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
that we've done last night and then that ran.

143
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
So I think somehow reading in the big file

144
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
at the same time writing out a big file

145
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
must have been a problem.

146
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
It just like freezes for like 10 seconds

147
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
and it literally drops that 10 seconds of audio.

148
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
So I'm not quite sure what's going on there,

149
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,760
but maybe the clue there is to not play back.

150
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
AIFF's that are big, maybe it should make it

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
into MP3 first, which of course is just more production time.

152
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,760
There's a lot of time goes into the production.

153
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
That's what one of the things Michael Gohagan was talking about.

154
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
He does a relatively short show, his real reviews,

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
but he spends a lot of time filling out the repetitive task

156
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
basically, which is stuff that you can automate

157
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
with a scripting language.

158
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Well, you could use Apple Talk.

159
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I think Michael's on Windows, so I don't know.

160
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
You could use Frontier Radio.

161
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
That's the stuff that I've been using

162
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
to kind of automate my processes

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
and get my Mac doing what I want to do.

164
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Thanks again, by the way, to Rich Graham

165
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,760
for sending in the Mojo Nixon Skid Roper clip.

166
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
There was something else I was going to say.

167
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,760
What was I thinking about?

168
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Shoot, I can't remember.

169
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
It's just a slow day today.

170
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
I have a meeting with actually the BBC,

171
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,760
God and BBC have so many shows.

172
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
So BBC wants to do, what is it?

173
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,760
The BBC International wants to do a radio interview.

174
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
We're going to do that today at the Angel Posting House,

175
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
which is hotel.

176
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
That's the one that we stayed at before we got the place here in Guilford.

177
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Remember when I found the Wi-Fi there?

178
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
And I had a meeting there yesterday, actually,

179
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
with the guy from a cell phone manufacturer.

180
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
It was a very interesting meeting.

181
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
So phone guys are all over podcast.

182
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
I'll tell you that.

183
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:29,760
And I went to log in and the Wi-Fi access point was there.

184
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Orbit8.com, ORBIT numeral8.com.

185
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
But for some reason, I just couldn't log in.

186
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
It wasn't working.

187
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
When I inquired about it,

188
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,760
the person behind the desk at the hotel said,

189
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Oh yeah, that was the same way yesterday.

190
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
A great.

191
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
So I guess everything's in order.

192
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Gabe sent me an email with a very interesting idea.

193
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I wanted to pass on to you.

194
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
He has a quick comment about show notes.

195
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,760
And he's doing something interesting over at the readcast.

196
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,760
That's R33T, C-A-S-T.

197
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm going to read this to you verbatim and we'll talk about it.

198
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
To do to your discussion of show notes in the past,

199
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I set up a system that I feel works very well.

200
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
As each person subscribes to the show,

201
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
they enter their email address.

202
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
This email address gets saved,

203
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
and in return they get a custom RSS feed to subscribe to.

204
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Then as each show is downloaded,

205
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,760
they receive in their mail the show notes for that show

206
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
after it's been downloaded.

207
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
If they choose to unsubscribe or skip certain shows,

208
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
they receive no show notes.

209
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Very interesting idea.

210
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,760
So it's kind of like a timed mechanism.

211
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
So once you have actually downloaded your individual show,

212
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
and it doesn't mean you've actually played it,

213
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,760
but once you've on your system either on your drive

214
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
or presumably on your MP3 player,

215
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
then you're going to get an email with the show notes.

216
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
I think that's a great idea.

217
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm going to subscribe to the readcast

218
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
just to go through the experience.

219
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I think that's interesting.

220
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Although you can't really pass off a subscription easily

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
then to someone else.

222
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
We have to think about that.

223
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
But I don't know.

224
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I guess people, when I want to subscribe.

225
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Well, for instance, it may not work in the directory.

226
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,760
If you went to the directory, you couldn't subscribe directly from it.

227
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Unless there was some way that it knew about your email address

228
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
and couldn't code that.

229
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
It's a good idea.

230
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I like that.

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Let's work on that.

232
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Let's see what else we come up with.

233
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,760
And thank everyone, by the way, my email box is just once again

234
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
it's overflowing with all kinds of great ideas and feedback

235
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
and sound seeing tours.

236
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
And I'm going to have to spend some time

237
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
this weekend catching up because it's just too much coming in.

238
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,760
There's no way in hell I can get all the promos

239
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
and the pod safe music and everything

240
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
into the daily 40 minutes.

241
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,760
I do have to take care of some business from Wednesday.

242
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,760
This is the answers to the hit trivia that young polettes.

243
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm proud of your casting with Andrew.

244
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Hi Adam.

245
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,760
This is a young polette with the answers to yesterday's hit test.

246
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Don't you just love that.

247
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,760
He sounds like he's just walked right out of the 80s

248
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
and flew into your eye.

249
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
It's most of the first one and you've got it right.

250
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Cut your glove in time.

251
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes.

252
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
That was the second one.

253
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
It's really a lot like Janet Jackson.

254
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
What if he done for me lately?

255
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Yeah, that's what I thought it was.

256
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
But obviously it was wrong.

257
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
But it isn't.

258
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
It's something completely different.

259
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
This is Donna Allen and Sirius.

260
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Sirius.

261
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Nah, this must have been,

262
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I know this was probably not something I never heard of.

263
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
So I've heard the track when Janet Jackson used it.

264
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
I've heard the hit song.

265
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I've heard the hit song.

266
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
I've heard the hit song.

267
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I've heard the hit song.

268
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Okay.

269
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Okay.

270
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Yeah.

271
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
I've heard that song.

272
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
I've heard that song.

273
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
I've heard that song.

274
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
This was the final one.

275
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,760
It's from 89 and yesterday you told us you had difficulty with

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
wreckage released after 87.

277
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
So I don't blame you.

278
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I know we'll take this take it in account for the next test.

279
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
From 89,

280
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Roadshitting Kathleen Toy.

281
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
What?

282
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Who?

283
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Hold on a second.

284
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
And I know the song,

285
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
but I don't recognize what he just said.

286
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
From 89, Roadshitting Kathleen Toy.

287
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Totally torn.

288
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Yeah, that's it.

289
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
It's good song.

290
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
So there you have it.

291
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
The three answers through yesterday's hit test.

292
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I'll see you in the next time.

293
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
See you later.

294
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Bye-bye.

295
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Thank you very much.

296
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
That was cool.

297
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,760
And of course, this is now struck a chord.

298
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
I'm even getting emails that say,

299
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Tired drum cadence.

300
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Wired?

301
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Trivia.

302
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Hey Adam, it's David and Seattle.

303
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Well, he asked for it.

304
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
So here's some 60s name that tune.

305
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I hope some of this is before your time.

306
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
So there's a little bit of a challenge.

307
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
This is...

308
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
The verse.

309
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
I think that's the verse.

310
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
I don't know the name of the song.

311
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Herman's Hermits.

312
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I don't know the name of that song.

313
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
I don't know the name of that song.

314
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,760
I don't know the name of that song.

315
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
I have no idea what that was.

316
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
The Who.

317
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm Pam.

318
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
That's the Who.

319
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Okay, Adam here.

320
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Hold on a second.

321
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
This is good.

322
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
He's actually going to do the answers at the...

323
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Right after this.

324
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Okay, that's what you should do, I guess.

325
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
If you do trivia, it's...

326
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Do the answers in the same sound files.

327
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
So don't have to wait until another day.

328
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Let's see how I did it.

329
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,760
It comes the titles and performers of these songs.

330
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
This is out.

331
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Feel a whole lot better by the birds.

332
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
I'll feel the whole thing.

333
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
See, I got the largest thing.

334
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Not Roger McWin.

335
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Right.

336
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Okay.

337
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Herman's Hermits.

338
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Here are my heart beat.

339
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
My heart beat.

340
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Right, right, right.

341
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Next one I did the neck.

342
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Grizzly bear by the young birds.

343
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Not just calling him singing the lead on this.

344
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
He does sing harmony in the chorus.

345
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Well, since he wasn't singing the lead, that's why I didn't know.

346
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
I guess.

347
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
I got it.

348
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Tiger by the tail.

349
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
God, I'm...

350
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
No, that's...

351
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
No, no, no.

352
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Maybe we should do 50s.

353
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Maybe that's easier for not goings.

354
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
And I can't explain by the clue.

355
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Right.

356
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Thanks Adam.

357
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Okay, but I did like...

358
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
What?

359
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Four out of six?

360
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Four out of five?

361
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
What was that?

362
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,760
If you want to send it to trivia, send it to MP3 Feedback

363
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Gmail.com.

364
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
That's where I'd like you to send the MP3.

365
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
So I got to geek their scores.

366
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
All other comments, of course.

367
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Adam and Curry.com.

368
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Hey Adam.

369
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:16,760
PW Fenton from Radio Free Radio's Digital Flots of my podcast.

370
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,760
So I understand that you're having a lot of fun with this music trivia.

371
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm going to give you some new trivia.

372
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
All right.

373
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
I like to play a game with several of my friends.

374
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
What kind of game do you like to play PW?

375
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Who are also a movie buffs that we call movie quotes.

376
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Now normally we just say the quotes and the other people have to guess.

377
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,760
But this time I'm going to use real audio quotes from the movies themselves.

378
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Oh, this is great.

379
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Okay.

380
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
This is actually something Michael Gohagan should do.

381
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,760
We should have him on a Skype and have him guess him.

382
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I know shit about movies, okay?

383
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Jack shit.

384
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
No, nothing about him.

385
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
So I don't expect I'll do very well on this.

386
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Here's nine of them.

387
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Jesus, I'm going to give the answers at the end.

388
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,760
So stop this after quote number nine if you don't want to hear the answers.

389
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Okay, quote number one.

390
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
What do you want?

391
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
You want me to help you?

392
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
You want me to have fun to let you go?

393
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
You want me to back for you?

394
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Well, I would not do it.

395
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
I would not leave the finger for you.

396
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Quote number two.

397
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I don't know.

398
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Brother.

399
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
You think and talk sometimes like a little child.

400
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Little child.

401
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Oh, no.

402
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
I agree.

403
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Well, that's the same size.

404
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Oh, shit.

405
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Um.

406
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
I said wacky movie.

407
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Nice.

408
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Tonight is a main size crisis.

409
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Oh, it's real on a show.

410
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
In this should have come to answer that way.

411
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
What?

412
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Number three.

413
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
What do you like?

414
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Blood.

415
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Word.

416
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
What are you doing?

417
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
You're not agein' right.

418
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Oh, why?

419
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Make maps.

420
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Make it money.

421
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
God, listeners.

422
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I hope you know what this shit is.

423
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I have no clue what these movies are.

424
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Make maps.

425
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
You don't get rich.

426
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Good thing either, believe me.

427
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Number four.

428
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Hmm?

429
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
What are you talking about?

430
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Children up by master.

431
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Who am I?

432
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I can't.

433
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Come fool.

434
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Come fool.

435
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Number five.

436
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
It's time to take the papers for my hand.

437
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
I can't help it.

438
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm a seer.

439
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
It's my business to know these things.

440
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
I'll live alone.

441
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,760
I'll listen to the sound of the waves and night.

442
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Follow the moon through the hands.

443
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
And the death from a solitude.

444
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I see a bit.

445
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
No idea.

446
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Anyone.

447
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Number six.

448
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sucking pretty much so far.

449
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Who is the terrible?

450
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Who is the name of the beautiful?

451
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Who is the name of the inaccessible?

452
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Who is the name of the black mother mother of dark?

453
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I don't know that one either.

454
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
There.

455
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Number seven.

456
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Okay.

457
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
I'm sucking.

458
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Hold the guys.

459
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Come to the light carry out.

460
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Number eight.

461
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Yes, it's true.

462
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
This man has no dick.

463
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Ghostbusters.

464
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Number nine.

465
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm there.

466
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Michael Jackson doings any kind of movie.

467
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
That was that.

468
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
I tell you the answer.

469
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
That was too tough.

470
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't think we can do.

471
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Okay.

472
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Very quickly.

473
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Here's the answers.

474
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Number one was from high noon.

475
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Number two was from a clockwork.

476
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Orange.

477
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Three was from starman.

478
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Four was from Spartacus.

479
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Didn't see that.

480
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Five was from cannery row.

481
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Then see that one.

482
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Six was from help.

483
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Number seven was from Poltergeist.

484
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
The out got that one.

485
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Eight was from Ghostbusters.

486
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Got that one.

487
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Number nine was from raising Arizona.

488
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I didn't see that one either.

489
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
And please.

490
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Everyone.

491
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Subscribe to radio free radios.

492
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
They did all flat them.

493
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
It's great show.

494
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
By the way.

495
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
I can fuse it with a Dr. Floyd radio show the other day.

496
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
And virtually didn't really mean to do that.

497
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Both shows are great.

498
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Well produced at a lot of fun.

499
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
What's this?

500
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
It's just broken out.

501
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
What's this?

502
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
What's this more trivia?

503
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I don't know what the hell this is.

504
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
This is some Scott St. Johnson.

505
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
What the hell is this?

506
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
What the hell is this?

507
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
What the hell is this?

508
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
What the hell is this?

509
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
What the hell is this?

510
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
What the hell is this?

511
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
What the hell is this?

512
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
What the hell is this?

513
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
What the hell is this?

514
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
What the hell is this?

515
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
And let's work on that too.

516
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Okay, so I guess what we have to do is if you have an trivia, send it in with the answers

517
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
on the same MP3 file.

518
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,760
I don't know about the movie trivia because it's no fun.

519
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I can't really.

520
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,760
I can't participate because I suck out incredibly much.

521
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,760
But I love the, I love the, the, the, the music trivia.

522
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
And a lot of feedback.

523
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
A lot of people liking that as well.

524
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,760
So let's see if we can get some good trivia going and see if we can come with some new ways

525
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
of playing the game.

526
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,440
It does work, though, it's kind of fun.

527
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
Actually, I was doing that with Christine of this morning.

528
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,360
You know, we run through the night's podcast that have come in

529
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,880
when I drive to school in the morning, and besides the fact

530
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,760
that she needed me to play the daily download again,

531
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,840
where she heard the invitation to be on the on the

532
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,040
on the Poop podcast, and I got another submission here

533
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,080
from York, York Mending.

534
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
I think he's a regular listener.

535
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,640
I've had gotten stuff from him before as well.

536
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,440
OK, this is cool.

537
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,040
This was a Saturday night live, Jimmy Fallon Ben Affleck.

538
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,720
And this is actually something, this is very cool.

539
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,120
You know how, if you're new to podcasts,

540
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,240
then you may still hear someone say here,

541
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,640
they're a robot, they have a robot.

542
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,560
That started through a conversation early on when you're just

543
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,000
all kind of beginning with what is now known as podcasting.

544
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,320
And talking about the big differences between regular radio

545
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,360
and podcasting, and a big part of the differences, of course,

546
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,560
is the way people talk.

547
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,720
And if you listen to any podcast you're going to hear normal people

548
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,240
talking.

549
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,520
It's funny because it's like covervill, which is a great show,

550
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,600
covervill.com.

551
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,560
It's Brian up in Canada, plays all songs, hit songs,

552
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,680
and great tunes, done by other artists, hence the name, covervill.

553
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,760
And I play that.

554
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,160
What I do is I walk around with my iPod,

555
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,120
I have the iPod trip on it.

556
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,680
So if Patricia and I are cleaning up in the kitchen,

557
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,080
I'll flip the iPod on, we'll turn the radio on.

558
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,960
So it's an engulfs the entire space.

559
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,000
And we'll listen to shows, and we'll listen to covervill.

560
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,160
And she says, this is a great show.

561
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,040
The stuff that Brian has to say is great.

562
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,760
But he just, you know, he doesn't have a radio voice.

563
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
There would ever get him on the air, anywhere

564
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,760
in traditional broadcast, maybe in Canada.

565
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
I can't speak for that.

566
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,440
But in the States, it just doesn't work their way.

567
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,200
Because you have to have that, you've got to have

568
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,320
your real of all the puky sounds you make.

569
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
And so that's, you know, we've done this before.

570
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,880
It's the top 40 goes, everybody, I don't know.

571
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,840
I get down when you buy had chill.

572
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,680
But that, it will be dull.

573
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,040
And you've got the light of him guys.

574
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,720
And everyone has such a fucking preset voice.

575
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,080
So Saturday Night Live, of course,

576
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
spoofed on that.

577
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,120
This is from, don't know when it was actually done.

578
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,320
But he sent me the sound clip.

579
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,920
I had to crank up the volume a bit.

580
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,400
So I hope you can hear the whole thing.

581
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
It's about five minutes.

582
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,680
So you may want to fast forward if you get tired of it.

583
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,240
But I find the whole thing is just fucking hilarious

584
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,160
because they take the total crap out of 80's DJs.

585
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Good morning, Soger to enjoy back in the fuzz.

586
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,520
Here we got that on the box.

587
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,800
We got Andrew with traffic.

588
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,400
Pretty heavy.

589
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
And I'm w you guys.

590
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,520
Maybe you should get a bikini wax.

591
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh man, on the box, get back in the box.

592
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
Oh, that more in the morning.

593
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,040
Next returns.

594
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Three, two, one, on the box.

595
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,640
So that, like, good back to my story.

596
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,280
I have, like, two of those seven layer burritos.

597
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,080
Let's just say they didn't schedule any bathroom breaks

598
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,600
in the middle of my nieces christening.

599
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,440
That's gross, you guys.

600
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,640
Lost door, short.

601
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,920
I ended up christening my BVDs with a lot of chocolate

602
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,720
putting 544 in the air.

603
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,080
We'll be right back.

604
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,760
Three, one, on the box.

605
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,280
Hey, Jordyn.

606
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,480
Zerdy, Dan, the garbage man, together again, dude.

607
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,120
Yeah, that's great.

608
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Welcome to Z105.

609
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,520
It's going to be great to have you here, man.

610
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,120
Thanks.

611
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,920
You got love this place.

612
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,680
I tell you what, you're coming on in a couple of minutes, right?

613
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,280
Yeah, why don't you introduce you during the show.

614
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,600
I want to know a lot of some of the transitions.

615
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,640
All right, great, I appreciate it.

616
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,480
Yeah?

617
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,720
It's going to be awesome, man.

618
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,080
It's your friend, yeah.

619
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,880
You know, put up on that.

620
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,720
Right, right.

621
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,120
See you one on the box.

622
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,320
And we're back.

623
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Folks, real special guests here this morning.

624
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,440
Dirty, dad, the garbage man.

625
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
Z105's newest DJ is here.

626
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,320
Hey, signers, Z's, let's.

627
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,040
Ah!

628
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,640
Yeah, that's nice.

629
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,320
Classic.

630
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,640
You're hilarious, Daddy Dan.

631
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,440
Well, come down, Andrew.

632
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,080
Looks like someone's trying to get some move-a-key.

633
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
Looks like you're going to have free moon hockey coupon.

634
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

635
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,360
All right, settled down.

636
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,480
Dirty, dad, and I started together at college,

637
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,200
stationed over at Rutgers.

638
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Piscatotti.

639
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,320
He went down to a table and said, Pete,

640
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
and he'd been tired of that place up.

641
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,920
Now, Dirty, yeah, I understand the FCC

642
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,120
who kicked you off the air for something you said down there.

643
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
That's right.

644
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
And I had this character, the notorious HIV.

645
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,840
Yeah.

646
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
They didn't dig on it.

647
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
I'm not really allowed to talk about it for the last six.

648
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,680
What a day's, let's go on straight on my Easter album.

649
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,320
You're a computer, Jason Taylor, kid you'd have.

650
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,640
Come on, Dirty, Dirty, Dirty, Dirty.

651
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,840
Oh, our intern, son, you just, you just, you just,

652
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,040
son, you.

653
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,080
Let's go to our buddy.

654
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,920
We're up to Dirty, Dirty, Dirty, Dirty, Dirty,

655
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,080
down to Samaris.

656
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,880
I am a you-it-ma-computer, dad.

657
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,520
So, Dirty, dad.

658
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,720
Let's see what you do, shall I?

659
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
I want to.

660
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,000
It's called, Dirty, and damn the garbage man

661
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,920
in the morning.

662
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,760
Did you go look at it's me?

663
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,080
I'm not that bad.

664
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,920
Hey, you might have been my crew in here?

665
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,300
That should go right ahead for the ride.

666
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,140
Okay, come on it, you guys, all right.

667
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,980
Let's see that guy right there is Sherlock Homo.

668
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,600
Elementary my queer Watson.

669
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,100
Hello.

670
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,340
This guy right here's our favorite half-book

671
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,420
and half-gags to wrap up to spot.

672
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Yo, I just want to say live-wage and prosper, bitch.

673
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,740
Oh.

674
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,860
That guy right there is the man in the can.

675
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,760
What's up, Joey Matt?

676
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,300
And this sexy lady over here is

677
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,980
and real with the traffic.

678
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,100
Hey everybody, hey man in the can.

679
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,140
I look to get in your can.

680
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,900
Man in the can, get back in that can.

681
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
Cheers.

682
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Yeah.

683
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,900
That's really great.

684
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,900
550 of the animal will be right back.

685
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah, what was that about?

686
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
What?

687
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
What?

688
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Do you totally stole my character's dude?

689
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
No, dude, no, I didn't.

690
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Oh really?

691
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Man in the box, man in the can.

692
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Yeah, I don't see how that's similar.

693
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
Okay.

694
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
You have Andrew doing the traffic?

695
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
He works for the station, man.

696
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
What?

697
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
You know what?

698
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
You know what?

699
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
We go back.

700
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
This bothers you.

701
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,900
We'll squash you, right?

702
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,900
I'll stop throw it away.

703
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Yeah.

704
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
Yeah, forget all right.

705
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
I'll go.

706
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,900
I could say that's right.

707
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,900
And we're back.

708
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Joey back here with dirty dad, the garbage.

709
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Now we got Matt of the box.

718
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900

719
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
ranging from different relatives.

720
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
All right.

721
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
I see the other's gotta be out here.

722
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900

723
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
We'll be right back.

725
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
This is what I'm about.

726
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
We're back!

727
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Joey Mac just tried to grab my weeder!

728
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
No kidding!

729
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900

00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
I'm a back!

731
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Most dirty dad just pooped on his own wainer.

732
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
He's got a poop wainer.

733
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Yo, what up? This is too spark.

734
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
It's illogical, but Joey Mac pooped his pants.

735
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Brother Diver, brother Diver.

736
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Brother Diver, brother Diver.

737
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Don't took out his pory and his tundor in his ear.

738
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
What's got to go?

739
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
Don't let him spit up the scuff in me.

740
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Oh, Joey Mac's got a major league, what are you?

741
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
I'm sure I call her when I love her!

742
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Let's make it happen.

743
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
He's got him out the funcicle in his pants.

744
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
What did I do?

745
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
He was not up to me!

746
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
He was not up to me!

747
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
He's not up to me!

748
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
He's not up to me!

749
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
He's not up to me!

750
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
He's not up to me!

751
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
He's not up to me!

752
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Oh my God!

753
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Oh my God, you guys.

754
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Andrew's right.

755
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Come on.

756
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
We don't have to fight, bro.

757
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
I mean, after all, we've been through.

758
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
You know what?

759
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
What do you say?

760
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
We bring our old bit out.

761
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Yeah, I don't even think I remember that.

762
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Come on!

763
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
Bro, of course I remember it.

764
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Let's bring out the... what's bring it back?

765
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Well, you mean the one and only?

766
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Yes!

767
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
The G83 Stooges bro!

768
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Hello!

769
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Hello!

770
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Hi!

771
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Hello!

772
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Come on!

773
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Yeh!

774
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Fuck!

775
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
I think Jimmy Fallon actually did most of the boys' jazz.

776
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
That was an April 4th.

777
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
We're that whole McDonald's.

778
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Yeah, right, Arm?

779
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Excellent.

780
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Excellent.

781
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Actually, you know, who used to really do great spoof of DJ's Magic,

782
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Matt Allen from Z100 in New York?

783
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
I wonder where Magic Matt is.

784
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I found him...

785
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Like two years ago he was...

786
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
I don't know where he went.

787
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
He wound up in Ciadley-thing.

788
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,380
Seattle, I think, or someone on the West Coast, he was doing an online radio show, which

789
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,420
was streaming, I believe, I think was a streaming show. He'd be great for podcasting.

790
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,860
I got to look him up, magic mad, magic mad at him, never bought it. He was also, I got

791
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,180
him a gig on VH1 for like two days, something like that. He was pretty good, a nice guy,

792
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,500
a little neurotic, but a nice guy. It's the Daily Tour Scode. It's Friday. It is January

793
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:12,340
28th, 2005, a gray, typical gray, gray day here in Britain. I have a meeting with BBC as

794
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,340
I said, coming up at 1 o'clock. So I'm going to wind up the show for today. We've been going

795
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,700
back and forth about you don't own me. Remember we found that, of course, we have the

796
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,620
list of these bitties version. We have the on the Ray Houses version from the early 80s. That's

797
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,820
the Dutch track that I played for you that was mixed up by young poet. We played Leslie

798
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,540
Gore with the original. And today I have a version done by an outfit called Rasputinah.

799
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,260
Very different type of version. This is also a, I believe this is a girl band. Hold on a

800
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,340
second one. I don't want to try and open up Firefox. I don't want to do that. I want

801
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:55,180
on recording my compute. Well, fuck it. Let's try. Let me see what happens if I hit Firefox.

802
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,020
It really goes a little bit wacky and the screen won't redraw and then I get the, here's

803
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,980
the beach ball. Anyone who's using macOS X and I was when I'm talking about the spinning beach

804
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,820
ball of death. And then it kind of like freezes there for a second. Okay. There we go. Got it. Hold on.

805
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,860
Let me open up a new tab. Of course, that will also take 15 seconds and other beach ball spin.

806
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:24,100
Why is that? Even what the fuck does this browser have to do that's so incredibly hard. It

807
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:32,260
must be a screen redraw something. Hold on. Rasputinah.com. There was something, I like the,

808
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,980
the homepage when I saw it. Hold on. I want to read you with the, the quote on the homepage. I

809
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,540
forgot to take note of that. Hold on. Another beach ball. God, this ain't this sucks. I mean, I've

810
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:47,380
got this blazingly fast connection. But the browser is just sitting there going, oh, okay,

811
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:55,540
it is. A division of the, of the lady's cello society. Cool. Let me see, they have pictures.

812
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,780
Photo, gravura. I was kind of like a Goth thing going on here. Cool. Group shot. Let's see what

813
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:10,660
they look like. It's two guys, two wood girls in a guy. Wow, they look kind of interesting. You should

814
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,820
definitely check that out. Rasputinah.com. Of course, I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

815
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,820
Check out their version if you don't own me.

816
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:59,220
Tell me what to do and don't tell me what to say when I go out with you. Don't put me on display.

817
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:10,340
You don't come on me now. Don't try to change me in any way. You don't, on me now. Don't

818
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:18,420
time me down the side. Never stand me. I don't tell you what to say at home. Don't tell

819
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:31,620
you what to do. Just let me be myself. That's all I have to do. You don't, on me now. I don't want to

820
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:57,060
tell you what to say at home. Don't tell me what to say when I go out with you. Don't put me on display.

821
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:06,660
You don't, on me now. Don't tell you what to say at home. Don't tell you what to do. Just let me be myself.

822
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,860
That's all I have to be.

823
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:42,500
You know what? Chicks with cellos or hot. I can't help but it's just nothing I can do about it.

824
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:50,180
Grasscutina, you don't own me. And just thinking of that song reminds me that the

825
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:57,860
cities are celebrating their first big podcast launch February 16th in New York City. I think

826
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,900
I know that's an official announcement yet but I'm trying to book my tickets. That's for sure.
