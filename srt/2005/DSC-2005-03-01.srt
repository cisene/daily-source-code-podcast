1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Yeah, Bunny, Bunny, Rabbit, Rabbit.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,320
This is March 1st Daily Source Code.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
Oh, justing.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,320
It's Adam Curry.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
Hey, everybody.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
That's right.

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,320
First of the month, welcome to the Daily Source Code.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,000
New location today.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,480
We are downstairs in the kitchen here at the Curry Cottage.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Reason being, I just don't have enough time to get it all done.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,320
Patricia is on a business trip.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,320
She's gone for two days, which means I'm Mr. Mom and podcast pod, father.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,360
Sorry, life's getting to the way of all the fun stuff.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,400
Man, I, you know, there's a lot to do in this household.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,240
Stuff that I hadn't realized, especially having been on the road myself for almost two weeks.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,920
Yeah, you come back and then you kind of forget all the stuff that goes into making a household

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
run.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,760
Let me just lower down the opening theme music here.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:07,040
So, because I'm going to have to take the headphones off or actually remove the ear buds

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,400
so that I can walk around.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
And I figured I'd do my chores while talking with y'all today.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,720
And the chores, well, they'd all started this morning.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,880
And of course, moms who are listening or stay at home dad's will probably be

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,840
chuckling right now, saying, you know, curry, what the hell is wrong with you?

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,560
Yeah, this is like, welcome to reality, right?

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,840
And aren't podcasts pretty much about reality in many cases.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,240
Let me see, get everything else set up here.

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,720
Okay.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
There we go.

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Right, let me just take the headphones off.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,720
So, it started this morning at 6.30, the alarm went because I had to get Christina off to school

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,000
and that, you know, that entails making a lunch.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,440
Well, actually, we still have the two dogs and the two cats.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,360
So they all need to be taken care of in the morning and have to be let out and walked

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,640
and fed or, you know, they all drink lots of water.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,800
You know, shoot the water bowl as empty again, hold on a second.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
And then there's a dishwasher, which I haven't emptied out yet.

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,840
There's lunch that has to be made, then I drove Christina to school, I actually considered

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:33,200
starting the podcast this morning before we went to school, but maybe I should, I thought

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
that maybe I should ask Christina before I just did that.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,600
Like me, she's not really a morning person.

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,960
We're not very good in the morning.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:51,760
So you can just imagine us two grouches kind of scouring over breakfast at each other.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,560
I didn't get to bed on time, or at least, you know, I wanted to be in bed around midnight,

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,680
but the way it works out with the time differences, five hours difference between East

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,880
coast of the US and the cottage here, Gilford, which means that if you want to have, you

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,880
kind of like a regular morning conference call with anyone, which, you know, it's like, you

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,560
know, 10 or 11 o'clock, it's already three, four p.m. here, Christina comes out of school

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
at three, thirty.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,720
And so what I've been doing is I've basically had the car service picker up and bring

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
her home.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
It's only like a 10 minute ride, but, you know, it's just right at that inconvenient

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
time.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,160
And I do like taking her to school, because we always have a good laugh in the car in the

56
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,760
morning listening to the radio or sometimes we'll listen to podcasts and we'll talk, talk

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,840
while it's going on at school.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440
This morning was an interesting conversation.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,720
We listened to the radio and there was some report about some middle school in the UK.

60
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,040
I think a little bit, it was in London or another suburb of London, and talking about

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,680
how many kids were bringing knives to school and other weapons, some joke like, oh, you

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,800
know, weapons of mass destruction said, oh, you know, what's with the guys at my school

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
of knives?

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
What?

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,160
So, you know, like pocket knives, like, you know, like, you know, this long, it's

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,520
you could actually tell me how long the knives were and what, you know, they have silver

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,960
bladed, but as well, what are they using for?

68
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Well, in case they get into a fight, they said, you got to be kidding me.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,840
So, well, that's never really actually happened, but it's kind of like a, it's like you

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,000
got your iPod, you got your knife, you know, it's like Jesus Christ.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,600
And then I kind of thought back to, when I was a kid going to school, and I went to a,

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,360
a, a Christian school, the Christian, the Christianly say him about the Felbert, and we had

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,520
all kind of, we were always carrying shit.

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,840
We had knives and, you know, stilettos, you know, which, you know, the switchblade, which

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,880
kind of like swings out and locks, and the other stilettos, which comes with shoots out

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,920
of the blade, kind of like a taxi driver thing.

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,400
We had all that shit as well, and it was just posturing, I guess, oh shoot, I don't know,

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,680
and I haven't, the gate is open, which I have to close, because otherwise the dogs would

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,720
run out to the front of the house.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,880
So, it's about three degrees centigrade, it was snowing this morning.

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,440
It's not quite as cold as the rest of some parts of Europe in, in Holland, I think it's

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,000
like five below, and last night it was definitely freezing here, and I'm, I'm going

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,200
to more and more dismayed with the house that we're renting, it's so cold, you know,

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:06,480
it's like, we pay, we pay a lot of money to rent this place, but you actually have to,

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,920
probably add another two to 300 pounds a month on to the bill just for the extra heating,

86
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,000
because, you know, these non double-pain windows, you walk past any window, you can literally

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,280
feel the cold just flowing over, it's not very handy, okay, so let me just start by

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:38,360
clearing out the dishwasher, another crappy feature of the rental home, the dishwasher sucks,

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,640
and it's too bad because we had a great dishwasher in Belgium at the castle, which we

90
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,200
could have taken with us, but the one here looked to be okay, but there's a couple of things

91
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:59,680
that just really aren't right, the knives slide through the knife, or the silverware container,

92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:09,440
and then, so they're like jammed down into the down below the rack, so it's impossible to take

93
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,440
the bottom tray out and then it derails all the time, just these little things, and I don't

94
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,960
know if I'm really a believer in washing machines anyway, you're basically handling everything

95
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:29,120
twice, and you become really lazy, particularly if you have one of these dishwashers that

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
empties itself automatically, have you ever seen that? Yeah, the way it works is Patricia

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:43,200
does it, that's why you don't realize what a pain in the acid is until you do it, okay, let me

98
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,240
see, so a couple of things I'm going to talk about today on daily source code, some of them

99
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,640
obviously podcast related, let me see, I have the line up here, we have, I'm going to talk

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,120
about some commercial podcast efforts that are popping up, talk about the iPod directorie,

101
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm going to talk about Father Roderick, he has some exciting news, and of course there's a

102
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,280
hit test, which is always fun, so let me just put the earbuds in for a second, because I received

103
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,400
Sid's mashup of the day, while you're here in the background, by the way, that's Radio 2,

104
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,560
that's Terry Wogan, does the morning show on Radio 2, and I think he starts at 7 or 730,

105
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,520
and he goes until 11 o'clock, it's a pretty long shift, but it's a fun show, very,

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,240
it's kind of like a podcast in a way, I have to say, he's just talking crap and he has his,

107
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
it sounds like he has his buddies there, it's not like a hot rock in flame through and morning show,

108
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
but he's just, you know, responding to viewer comments and has talks to people on the phone

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,200
and plays really, really good songs, at least songs that I like, you know, but of course I'm

110
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,440
an old fart and 40, so let's see, Sid sent me a track by John Wignal, aka DJ Wig, quality,

111
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,280
not too good Sid says, oh, that's too bad, but a brilliant mashup, beds are burning by midnight oil,

112
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,000
and this is how we do it, my Montel, Jordan, totally made for each other. Later this week,

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,760
oh, this is, oh, Sid is now teasing stuff, the 80s porn version of back to life, sold to whole, okay,

114
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,240
so we'll look forward to that, Sid, the mashup, pimp daddy, but right now this is how we burn the beds.

115
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:49,760
Oh, I don't know, oh, this is how we do it, this is how we do it, it's Friday night,

116
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,240
and I feel all right, the parties here run the wayside, so when each for my party and I turn it up,

117
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
there's a glee that got me taking the keys to my truck, it's a shock as I'm faded,

118
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,080
but he's in the street saying money, oh, we made it, it's so good, and I live tonight,

119
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,040
but so much less hurts, and we're going to sleep for a while, looking back,

120
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,080
he's got about the time I buy, he got to get you through, but oh, you don't get paid,

121
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,320
so tomorrow we'll come and throw your hands up, and let me hit a party, I'm kind of buzzing, it's all because

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,480
South Central does it like nobody does, tomorrow my neighbors are getting much flavour,

123
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,240
let's flip the track, bring the old school back, this is how we do it,

124
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,080
this is how we do it, all hands are in the air, and away from from here to the air,

125
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,480
if you're in our team, that's what I want to be playing, you can see the hood's been good to me,

126
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,040
ever since I was a lower-case cheat, but now I'm a big cheat, look at what I see, I got to money,

127
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,160
I'm not a middle-chore, you feel right from where I'm from, where I'm from, and you wouldn't know,

128
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,320
then I gotta get mine and a big black truck, you think it's yours in a 6' hole, whatever it is,

129
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,240
the water is a better way, so tip up your cup and throw your hands up, and let me hit a party, say,

130
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm kind of buzzing, it's all because South Central does it like nobody does, tomorrow my neighbors are getting much flavour,

131
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:29,200
let's flip the track, bring the old school back, I'm kind of buzzing, it's all because South Central does it like nobody does it like

132
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,880
why in me, it's C-C, I'm my hobbies, I'll never come back on it all school tracks,

133
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,160
check it out, once upon a time in 90, my child made no money and my child was so, and all that I said was 6'8",

134
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,640
he's doing, and people don't know the music that he made was good, the lipid DJ and Paul was his name,

135
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,720
he came up to money, this is what he said, do it without jail, I don't know about it, some guys,

136
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:01,360
sell a million records and we'll make it the day, oh, I'm buzzing, it's all because South Central does it like nobody does,

137
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,360
all my neighbors are getting much flavour, I'll never come back on it all school tracks,

138
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm kind of buzzing, it's all because South Central does it like nobody does it like nobody does it like

139
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:29,120
always part of time, straight up coming from the west side, oh, she's got the flavour, yeah,

140
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
and money does it like nobody does it like nobody does it like

141
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,760
quality wasn't too bad, this is how we burn the beds, you heard it here on the daily source code,

142
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
it's the first of the month, remember we said, bunny bunny rabbit rabbit which is supposed to

143
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
be the first thing out of your mouth on the first day of a new month and it's supposed to bring you

144
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,000
health and wealth and fame and riches and all kinds of groovy stuff, so I said it for you all,

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,760
since I've got all that and I'm really happy and feel extremely privileged, almost done with

146
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,920
three, I can't believe it, the two of us made that big a load for the dishwasher, that's just

147
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,480
ridiculous, I'm learning, I'm learning, okay, time to load it out, speaking of mashups,

148
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:23,680
lots of responses about the news that the Battalica site was shut down, and of course,

149
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,760
none of them from lawyers as far as I can tell, but a lot of different opinions about what can and

150
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,000
can't be done, I'm going to, oh, let me just walk over to the, to the power book, so one of them

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,280
is from Eric, he says, he says, if you record a song as a parody of the original, you are protected

152
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,520
from copyright infringement, because on to say, we're the link of each show that's to be true

153
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,440
when he recorded parody songs that when he asked the original artist for permission first and they

154
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,600
said, no, he did it anyway because you're allowed to do that as a parody under fair use.

155
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
I would think that Battalica presenting Beetle songs in a parody format started like Metallica

156
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
would fall under this as well, but Battalica should check with their lawyers, yes, of course,

157
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,560
Eric, from the soundhouse studios, I agree, they should check with their lawyers, and unfortunately,

158
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,440
you got to have lawyers for almost everything these days, and then other people have sent an email

159
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,640
saying that, you know, you can do that with almost any song except for basically the Beetles,

160
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,040
the Rolling Stones, and one or two others, I'm not quite sure, I think that

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,360
there's probably a lot of strong arming going on with this stuff, and it's really a shame,

162
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,320
I mean, if I were Metallica or if I were who owns the Beetles, it's still Michael Jackson,

163
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,960
who owns the Beetles catalog, I'd be ecstatic, you know, I'd be like, how do we release this stuff?

164
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,080
How do we, basically, repackaging of already great material, we should be able to make money on it?

165
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,960
And the oops, shit, no, and the Battalica musicians as well,

166
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:00,400
that's weird times we live in, that's not sure, okay, almost done loading up the

167
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:09,600
mornings breakfast, this is our breakfast mashup here, okay, what else do we have?

168
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,960
Table, oh, Christina, I didn't take her lactose pill, she's a little bit lactose intolerant,

169
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,120
although that's gotten much, much better since we moved here, I don't know if there's

170
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,320
well, I'm sure there's different types of cows, I don't know if the milk is different or whatever,

171
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,720
but she really, it's not that bad, whereas you know, if you had like mashed potatoes and put

172
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,480
even a little bit of milk in there, it would trip around, it really, it's sad because it, you know,

173
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,880
she gets a stomach ache from it. Okay, see, a derailed again, fucking you.

174
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:56,240
Good, done, I'm getting there, I also have to vacuum the place it's just a stye, man, it really

175
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,280
is. How does Patricia do it? How does she keep up with all this crap?

176
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,840
So last night, before I went to bed, I actually had a little phone call with

177
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,920
Madge Weinstein, who had emailed me a press release that she was putting out or was about to put out

178
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,000
and wanted to have my okay on it, about the Madge Weinstein iPod Shuffle Contest,

179
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,240
which is just an amazing thing that she's doing, went out and spent, well, must have

180
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:34,480
meant at least $5 or $600 of her own money to promote the yeast radio show, yeastradio.com.

181
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,640
And I guess the deal is, it's starting today, you have to listen to all of the yeast radio

182
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:49,920
programs or whatever podcasts are being released for clues and every week, one lucky listener

183
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,920
will receive an iPod shuffle, the 500 gigabyte, a gigabyte, whoops, that would be a shuffle.

184
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:08,320
A mega shuffle, now the 500 megabyte and it will come preloaded with all of the Madge Weinstein

185
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,200
yeast radio podcasts, which I think is great and actually in the press release, she goes in this whole

186
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:21,280
tire rate about, you know, so what if Bono and YouTube have their iPod, Madge has their

187
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,360
Madge pod or yeast pod or whatever it is, and she sent me a promo, which we're going to have

188
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:37,600
a listen to right now. Hello everyone, this is Madge Weinstein of yeastradio.com with an

189
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:46,080
important announcement, starting March 1st, I am going to be giving away one free iPod shuffle

190
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,320
out every week for the next five weeks, but you have to listen to yeast radio to find out how.

191
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,600
Along with this iPod shuffle is going to be a full collection of all the yeast radio shows to date.

192
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,920
You have to listen to yeast radio to find out how to win this, and this is not a free iPod

193
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,760
scam, I have all five iPods in my possession, and they are for you, my general audience. So listen

194
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,920
to yeastradio.com very carefully for instructions on how to win the iPod shuffles.

195
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,960
The shuffles. Excellent, great promotion, great contest. And this is not like one of those

196
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,800
get a free iPod deals. You know, she actually went out and bought the iPods and is probably

197
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,960
still in the process of preloading them. So this is a real deal, and as you certainly get her a lot

198
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,200
of listeners or extra listeners, and hopefully you will subscribe as well. By the way, the yeast

199
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,520
radio program is certainly not safe for work. So we look at the paper for a second here, what's going

200
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:05,280
on in the UK? The paper I like is the Financial Times, or as we say here, FT. I don't know what

201
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,440
it is about the Financial Times, but it really just seems to always have the stories that I'm interested

202
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,400
in. It's a mix of business and finance and world news, but right at the top here, Jackson's TV

203
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,680
thriller, celebrity trial gives a boost to courtroom television page 12. There's a whole thing in here

204
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:34,160
about reality television. Here, people are going to court TV and other broadcasts are hoping

205
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,920
for a big boost to the audiences from Michael Jackson's trial. That's right, and it is going to

206
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,880
be huge, and it's kind of disgusting. I hear news reports everywhere, and there's so little respect

207
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,720
for Michael Jackson. Here they all call him, well, I guess Wacco Jacco is pretty much

208
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:06,720
universally used around the globe, but I've been in that position, not in, obviously, not in

209
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:15,760
Michael Jackson's exact position, but it sucks, man, when people show no respect, and it's

210
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:26,800
I don't know. There's so many, I think recently even we're seeing more and more people posting

211
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:34,240
about how inaccurate the press really is, and this is no news to me, because I think I've been interviewed.

212
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,080
Well, I've been in newspapers and radio television interviews since I was

213
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,640
16, but really since I was 19, half of my life has been in show business. I don't think of

214
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,160
ever read one single interview that was entirely right, and usually there's just all kinds of

215
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:57,840
mistakes in there, and what you learn is that it's really your fault. It's not the media's fault.

216
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,560
It's how you, you have to be a better storyteller. You have to explain better what you're talking

217
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,240
about, and it really shows how little people understand when it comes to two-way communication,

218
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,920
and I've come to the realization more and more that sometimes I'm really not a good communicator,

219
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,320
and people just really understand things differently, or to have a different take on them, or we're

220
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,560
thinking something else at the time when you have to look for the clues, which I don't really

221
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,360
like doing phone interviews. I like talking to people face to face, so you can really see if they're

222
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,600
understanding what you're talking about. Okay, hold on, let me just, I've got to do the countertop.

223
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,560
One of my using here, Mr. Mussela, a Johnson and Johnson, a family company. That's great.

224
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,240
Johnson and Johnson, a family company. Mr. Mussela loves the job you hate. That's a registered

225
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,280
trademark, by the way. It's the kitchen, dissolves grease, kills bacteria. Let's give it a shot. Meanwhile,

226
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,680
Spandole Ballet is gold in the background, on the Terry Wogan Show. 8 million listeners that guy has,

227
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,280
that's pretty massive. Of course, the infrastructure, BBC radio is nice. People really do listen to

228
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,120
the radio in the UK, and that's probably because satellite and cable still hasn't really made it all

229
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,760
the way into a foot, I mean, it just hasn't penetrated the way it hasn't. In other countries like the

230
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,720
states, and sky satellite has only been around for 10 years or something like that, so it's just

231
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,200
not really peeking into massive availability, and it really works very well. But before that,

232
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,800
people will just listen to the wireless, and they'd enjoy it.

233
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:55,120
All right, the almost done here. Let's start to look like a, almost look like the way Patricia does it.

234
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,560
Okay. Let me do that. Kitchen table, and then we can talk a little bit more.

235
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,520
See, it's really hard actually to clean and talk at the same time. I can't concentrate on

236
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:17,040
two things. I'm not multitasking like life. Okay. Here we go. By the way, a lot of people want to know what

237
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,640
Patricia was doing. She has a cosmetics company called LePy Cosmetics, and she's doing some

238
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,360
rather large deals with it over the next two days, and it's cool, you know, it's good for her to get

239
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,200
away as well, and just be doing some stuff with other people, even though it's hard work and she's got

240
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:43,520
all kinds of early and late meetings to move. Right. Okay. Back to the computer. What do we have?

241
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:52,640
Ah, Scriss tomes would Chris, a Chris said. See, notice the, it's ever since you discovered

242
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,360
the world of podcasts and his trips to the iTunes Music Store have been much less. It's also,

243
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,000
he says, save me tons of cash. And I wonder if other podcasts listeners have the same experience.

244
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,160
Giving the limit of time that he has to plug in the iPod on the way to work and the car on the

245
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,160
train, his time is spent tuning into a half a dozen or so podcast on a daily basis. Hence,

246
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,760
less time to listen to music and the need to line the pockets of Apple.

247
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,120
So does podcast equal less Apple iTunes downloads or will it have no effect or will

248
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,560
the more popular podcasts sell their souls to iTunes and charge 99 cents or whatever to download

249
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,840
them. Good question. Very good question. Well I thought I think we talked about that the other

250
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,960
day that we're going to see all kinds of services popping up. In fact, not a day goes by

251
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,760
that someone doesn't send me a link. I've actually, you know, I decided that I'm probably

252
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,640
just going to create a category for this in the iPod or directory of podcasts services.

253
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,560
Which is pretty much like a weblog service. In fact, it's just two sides of the same coin.

254
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,800
So what you see is everyone pretty much has the same idea. You know, you a place to

255
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:13,440
upload your files to manage them, to manage the ID3 tags, to create your feed, maintain your feed,

256
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,800
maintain your show notes and it's all all different versions of that. What I don't see is any

257
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,400
real or any realistic pricing on on bandwidth, which is where I think a lot of these, you know,

258
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,680
great ideas and great services and you know, the idea is there and it's really going to help

259
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,320
people, although I still think we need something much simpler. There are probably hundreds of

260
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:45,360
thousands of people out there who want the podcast, but have no, no, what I call it, just really

261
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,120
don't want to know about ID3 tags. They don't, they won't mind entering in show notes, but I

262
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,760
think that's it, you know, it should be click record, enter some information or what we call

263
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,600
show notes and that's it, you're done, you know, it should be out there, it should be working.

264
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:07,040
I am about to give you a live demonstration of the San Seo. I haven't talked about it in a few days.

265
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,720
Mine is getting a little bit cruddy actually and if you don't, you're not careful when you

266
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,240
close it, then the pressure or it doesn't seal properly and then the pressure builds up and

267
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,800
it spews out the side, which is always a fun effect. I freshly washed cup, washed by yours truly

268
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:33,520
in the machine. So I got my pod in there and I have the cafe crema coffee pod, medium roast.

269
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
Let's see what this packaging says. You know, I never really pay attention to the packaging.

270
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:47,200
New. Oh, a new way to enjoy great coffee. We seal for freshness. Individual soft coffee pods

271
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,040
provide exactly the right amount of freshly brewed coffee. Can we use an any coffee pod,

272
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,320
crema machine? Excellent. Okay, so that's how long it took for the water to warm up. It's done.

273
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,440
Hit the button and now the freshly brewed taste is dripping into the cup. It's coming out of two

274
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,840
spouts simultaneously. It's going to give me exactly the right amount. I like to put a little sugar in

275
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,840
and they also a little bit of milk in and I usually do that while it's still just a safe time,

276
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,680
but it's not fast enough for me. I put it all in while it's still dripping into the cup.

277
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:35,040
And now it's just about stopped. Perfect. Okay, okay. So bandwidth. Yeah, that's going to be a big deal.

278
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,400
Now I've been doing some calculations and it gets pretty gnarly pretty quickly. So the question is,

279
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:51,280
man, I wish Bitcoin wasn't under such heavy attack. I'm so worried to start talking about

280
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,960
or implementing Bitcoin because just the fact that the name Bitcoin has a real negative connotation

281
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,760
with the man with the authorities these days, but I think it is certainly a solution to the ban with

282
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:17,920
issue. But what I don't really see is, you know, there's a couple of ways to look at podcasts.

283
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,600
One is in the kind of like as an audio blog post. So crack the mic and just talk and then this

284
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,280
people who are kind of making little pieces of art and productions and shows and whatever you want to

285
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,200
call them and it takes a lot of work. It really does. By the way, I'm just wondering around

286
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,080
it's kind of like what I'm on the telephone and do the same thing. Are you a wanderer on the

287
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,120
telephone? I can't sit still when I'm talking to someone. And I guess I'm talking to you. So I'm going

288
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,800
to wander around. I'm in the in the dining room now trying to collect my thoughts about this stuff.

289
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,520
I haven't really seen anyone come up with the grand idea of how we can actually make money on podcast.

290
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,240
All I'm seeing is rehash of traditional models, which is great, but not for a number of years.

291
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,120
There's just no way there's going to be enough listeners to podcasts to really make a dent with

292
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,840
any kind of advertising dollars. So we'll have to figure out either some other way or some kind of

293
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:30,080
bootstrap or what I think is working very well for me, at least, is find a product that you're

294
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
passionate about or make a product or a service that you're passionate about and use your podcast

295
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,160
to talk about it and build an audience. So it may not be very big audience, but if it's an audience

296
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,040
that's buying a product or the one that you like, it could certainly work. I've really been selling

297
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,440
coffee machines. It's unbelievable. And I didn't really think about it. I always talked about the

298
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,760
coffee machine and then decided to, at least to put a link on my web blog. So if you want one,

299
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,320
you can buy one yourself and I've sold. I should take, well, I don't want to fire up fire

300
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,200
fox now, but it must be close to 30 at this point. It's really unbelievable. And also I get credit

301
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,920
for people buying the pods and other accessories. I want to talk about Gmail for a second,

302
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,680
interesting the other day, Gmail, I'm going to sit down, you know mine. Gmail went down the other

303
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,200
day. I had never seen that happen. And it was a little frightening for a second, I'm like,

304
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,440
oh my god, you know, and you come to realization, what if Gmail loses all my shit? That would

305
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:41,680
really suck. I'm sure that they've probably got their data, backup situation or whatever under

306
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:48,160
control. It seems like the Google grid is one, humongous raid. So the data is probably reasonably

307
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,320
safe, but it does suck when the, when the service is down. And I have to say, compared to other

308
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,680
email services, it's not bad. I mean, I've seen Apple's email go down severely. I mean, I have my own

309
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,280
email server, which I've run for years. And, you know, there's always some shit that crops up with

310
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,840
that, too, you know. And then, yeah, the biggest problem with, with most email systems, if you,

311
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,520
if you use a laptop and you're roaming around is, you know, that damn port 25, you know,

312
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:26,080
SMTP port. So you can't send mail unless you've got the, you know, the proper authentication

313
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,840
authorization, which the web mail stuff, of course, works beautifully. And I like it very much. I am

314
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,280
seeing, however, a tremendous amount of spam that Google isn't catching. Now, you have the report

315
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,120
spam button, the keyboard shortcut for that is an exclamation point. And I do it all the time.

316
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,560
And all the spam that I get, I'm very consistent about that. And still, it keeps coming in,

317
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:55,120
you know. And, and, and so I don't know if, uh, if there's, there's no setting to tighten it

318
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,240
up or anything like that. But I think that Google has to kind of relook at some of their,

319
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:08,800
you know, some of their, we call that, uh, algorithms. There you go.

320
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,400
I do think it's kind of funny though how, and the funny and maybe scary at the same time.

321
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:23,920
So I received, uh, an email from a venture capital firm, uh, with some very, you know,

322
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:32,080
like some suggestions, obviously. And you look over to the right in your Gmail and on the right,

323
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,920
there's all these ads for, you know, looking for funding. You know, uh, and like, wow, man,

324
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,320
that that's pretty intense. It read my email and started giving me links to go to places

325
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,200
based upon the content of my email. And for some reason, I didn't really feel too bad about it,

326
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,200
you know, because I, I do consider email and anything I put on my computer to be just, you know,

327
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,040
completely open and eventually accessible to anybody. I don't think there's, you know, well,

328
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,720
you see this logo on my weblog. There are no secrets on the information you don't yet have.

329
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,720
But anyway, it would be nice if, uh, if Google could work a little bit on the, uh, on their algorithms,

330
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,520
get a little less spam coming in. Uh, then after yesterday's, uh, uh, little talk about, uh,

331
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,880
people to maintain, it's time to spark up your home.

332
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
Hello.

333
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,720
Yes, today's plea for editors for the, uh, uh, iPart.org directory.

334
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,840
Well, though, thank you very much. Lots of people wanted to contribute. Really, really,

335
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,240
love it. Um, and so I've already handed off at least 10 nodes this morning. I still got a lot to go

336
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,040
and people are also coming up with new nodes they want to add to the directory. Um, if you're interested,

337
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,480
it's iPart.org. Uh, iPart.org slash contribute tells you how you can contribute to, uh,

338
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,560
creating this directory. And as I said yesterday, uh,

339
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,280
Marcus's work, Marcus Maloe, I've been working with for, for many years, is working on, uh,

340
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,920
expanding the directory so that each individual node, um, you know, every editor of a, of a

341
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,800
category, which I call node managers, uh, will have a whole bunch of tools to really make that,

342
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,840
well, it'll be a weblog all by itself. You know, so that you can, um, really promote that category.

343
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,400
You should be able to, uh, work much closer with the, uh, with the people who are providing,

344
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,680
podcast for that category. And you should also be out, you know, be able to recruit and go out and

345
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,000
find stuff and not just wait for submissions. You know, let's really build this sucker out. That's

346
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,520
going to be fun. Um, so thank you all very much. If, if you're looking to do an OPML file to add

347
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,560
into the directory, um, although in the, you know, the iPart.org slash contribute, there's lots of,

348
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,240
options and explanations about how you can do it. I mean, you can even create your OPML file by hand.

349
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,680
What we're seeing though is that, you know, people who are, for instance, will do it by hand,

350
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,720
which is just so beautiful. This, um, A that it's simple enough for you to be able to edit this by hand,

351
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,040
but B that people are willing to do that kind of work. Uh, you see that in, you know, like,

352
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,400
note pad on windows, it adds all kinds of funky characters when you save it out. So trying to stay away

353
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:19,040
from that and for the time being, I still would suggest you use, uh, radio user land, uh, which

354
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,080
has a great OPML, uh, it's, uh, the whole thing is OPML. It's inherent to the program. And it works

355
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,680
perfectly on Macintosh and on Windows. And I was thinking, I saw that Steve Kirk's, uh, I guess

356
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,720
is the product manager at user land. He, uh, he, he heard the mention yesterday. I'm thinking Steve,

357
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,040
you know, why don't you help everybody out here, since, you know, maybe there's a discount or something

358
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,360
that people can get if they're working on the, on the iPod or directory, just a thought.

359
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,200
I don't want to beg or anything like that. Have you got to move along here? This, uh,

360
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,760
has 35 minutes into this. Um, wanted to plug a project of a real good buddy of mine, Peter Ford,

361
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,000
uh, Peter Ford was, uh, Christina's, I want to say six grade teacher. And this was the guy who sent me an email

362
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,840
or a sent home a letter with all the kids saying, you know, I'm Peter Ford, your, your son of

363
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,600
daughters, uh, uh, teacher. And if you have any questions, send me an email. And this was,

364
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:21,360
to what was this, uh, um, six years ago, five or five years ago. Uh, and at the time, I was like,

365
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,960
wow, you know, that's pretty cool. Have a teacher, you know, being, you know, soliciting email.

366
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,280
And with him, we got the whole concept of web blogs and school started, uh, at least at the

367
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,800
British School of Amsterdam when we started, uh, doing project web blogs, where each student

368
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,960
created a project in a blog, which was great because all of them had this built in audience,

369
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,160
not just of their peers, but their parents and brothers and sisters and grandparents and friends.

370
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,640
And it was very successful. And from that, we built school blogs.com, which is still running today

371
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,240
with thousands of, uh, free, um, uh, school blogs for teachers, students, schools, uh, you know,

372
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,480
all educational stuff. And he's got something else going on. He says, uh,

373
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,560
wonder if you give a shout out on your blog. Well, this will be the next best thing. Of course,

374
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,280
everything is in the show notes. Uh, to the Keepers Poetry Project that he set up with Oxford

375
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,320
Brooks University. Basically, use the web blog to have kids collaborate with real audience,

376
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,520
purpose, et cetera. You know, the educational score. Yes, I do Peter. I would love to see podcasters

377
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,880
include their own Keepers poem in their podcasts because it would give another twist on the whole

378
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,640
poetry performance angle. So there's a link to it to, uh, to, uh, actually, to his, uh, web blog where

379
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,800
explains everything, um, and then, of course, he winds up saying a beer or Starbucks coffee is long

380
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,920
overdue. Yes, dammit. It's been years, Peter. Where the hell do you live? I forgot what you live.

381
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm sure you don't live in your gulf or you probably live up in the sticks. All right. Let's, uh,

382
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,360
got a couple more things to do here before I get out for today. Um, a promo. Yeah.

383
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,240
Hey, this is Ferd from AirFerg.com. My wife and I do a podcast about once a week on some random

384
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,840
topic that we pull out of our butts. And, uh, here's a little taste of something we did for our

385
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:18,560
Valentine's Day show. Do your dick chain. You don't know me, but I know you. I see one TV and then

386
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,720
pictures online and I just have to let you know that I think you're hot. I'm sure that some people

387
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,000
would call it a crash, but I'll leave it up to you to figure out what these feelings are. I've

388
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,680
admired you from afar ever since you came into the world spotlight in 1999. You're probably saying

389
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,400
to yourself who me and I say yes, you. I think you get the idea. If you want to check us out,

390
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,280
go to airferg.com. That's A-I-R-F-E-R-G dot com. Thanks for listening. Bye bye.

391
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,880
Airferg. Hey, I'm about ready and got my, uh, on my crap together so I can start

392
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,360
emptying out the MP3 feedback at gmail.com account. So once I've done that, then you can start submitting

393
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,240
more promos. It's been nice to have a little bit of a rest though from the promos because such

394
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,040
credible amount of work to go through them all and yeah, and it's also, it's a bit disturbing

395
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,160
because people get really pissed off when, you know, like, how can we didn't play my promo? Well,

396
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,120
we only got 40 minutes to do so. Oops, come here. Dogs have to go out. Come here. Jessie,

397
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,720
are you lying on the couch? Oh, come on, girl, go. Come on, come on, buddy. Come on, come on, come on.

398
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,120
Now, you won't believe this. The dog is laying on the beautiful couch

399
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,840
pausing the air on her back, giving me the big wide-eyed stare. Come on, girl. Come on,

400
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,560
come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

401
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,240
There you go, good girl. Come on. She speaks Dutch. Well, actually Dutch and any English. Come on, girl.

402
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,040
Push them. Swabber? That's her other little dog. Come on, come on, guys. Oh,

403
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,360
the door is still locked. Come on, one out. Take Christina to the school.

404
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,240
Yep. There you go. Good girl. Come on. Swabber, yeah, go. The other one speaks Dutch too.

405
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Swabber, Z-W-A-B-B-E-R stands for mop. That's the Dutch word from mop. He's a little

406
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,800
Yorkie, Yorkshire Terrier. Yes, go ahead and bark. I just saw the nail arrive.

407
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:47,040
Where we have here. We have, oh. Everything happens at once now, who's calling?

408
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,120
Junkmail, junkmail. Oh, man, that's another thing about a rental home. You get so much mail for

409
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,520
previous tenants. It's not funny. And you have to kind of keep it

410
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,280
because I do tend to drop by once in a while and say, hey, have you seen my nail?

411
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,960
I was really excited about the Catholic insider podcast. Talked about that yesterday as well.

412
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:21,840
Father Roderick with his podcast, sound seeing of the Vatican. He sent me an email. He says he's got

413
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,880
some great news. He is being allowed or has been given permission to do a sound seeing tour inside

414
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,040
the huge power of Vatican radio. And that's not all. I'm reading this directly from the show notes.

415
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,480
I'll read the way he wrote. I've been talking here about podcasting and I thought the Vatican

416
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
should get into podcasting. You know what? They totally dig it. They immediately saw the great

417
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,000
new advantages of subscribing to an RSS feed, the possibility of getting high quality audio

418
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,520
to the listeners, the idea of getting people the opportunity to listen to a show whenever and wherever

419
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,720
they want. So I've been invited to head over to the Vatican again today. Talk with their webmaster

420
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,680
to explain to her, wow, there's women in the Vatican. How to set up an RSS feed and how they can

421
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,560
start podcasting. Ain't it cool? I almost feel like I'm not only an evangelist of the gospel,

422
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,760
but also a podcast evangelist, absolutely father of Roderick, you are. But in the good news about

423
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,320
podcasting in Vatican City. So the sound seeing tool will be up later today. It's going to be awesome.

424
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:29,040
Got to see places where no tourist has gone before. Now that is cool. And the minute it's out,

425
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:36,000
I'll add it to the sound seeing tours.com podcast feed. Very excited about that. And I really,

426
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,400
really do enjoy your podcast father Roderick. I love the most is when you say, oh my gosh.

427
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,880
I hear that a lot. Oh my gosh, he says, yeah, right on.

428
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,880
Hi Adam. Hey on. This is hit test number 17. Oh man, we're moving. Before we start,

429
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,720
let me say that I really didn't know that you had that many listeners. What do you mean?

430
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,760
I saw that there were 50,000 in November. All right. If that amounts,

431
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,280
what does grown to 80,000. Wow, that's really a lot. I hope that the hit test has contributed to that.

432
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,320
Yeah, yeah, it will not really contribute to that. I mean, it's it's creaking the dot

433
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,600
Mac infrastructure. Well, okay, the hit test. Let's start right away. This is number one.

434
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,960
Not hit me. Oh, I know that one. And once again.

435
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,240
Chuck a con. Ain't nobody. That was easy.

436
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,440
And this is number two.

437
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,920
One more time.

438
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,400
The Tina Turner, maybe?

439
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,200
It sounds like a Tina Turner production, but I don't know what it is.

440
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,520
Unfortunately. And now the final one.

441
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,440
It's short. One more time. One of my favorite songs. Without a doubt, that's talk, talk,

442
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
life's what you make it. But I don't know what number two is. So maybe we got two for three.

443
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,080
It really shouldn't be too hard. This is answer number one.

444
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,880
It's roofers and chuck a con. Ain't nobody.

445
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,160
Still a great song. 20 years old.

446
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:46,640
I remember I just got to stop it for a second. Reminds me of a really good friend.

447
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:56,640
And we just moved to New York in 1987 and Dan Hartman. The guy from Me Light My Fire.

448
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,080
Man, Patricia and I went to see a Joe Cocker show with him at the bottom line. I think

449
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,320
it was the bottom line. Because he and Charlie Midnight had written and produced Joe Cocker's album.

450
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,200
This they had just done James Brown living in America. These guys were on top of the world making

451
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:22,000
super hit records. And we were driving back to our apartment on 56th and Broadway. And Dan was driving.

452
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,480
And I don't know if we were drunk or a little bit high. But it was, I just remember him going

453
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,480
off on Chaka Khan. And he was doing this whole Chaka Khan rap. And he imitated the way she talked.

454
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,120
It was so, so funny. That just flashed into my mind hearing that. Unfortunately, Dan passed away.

455
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:46,800
Oh man, I think that he must have passed away 10 or 11 years ago of AIDS. And I miss him. I miss him.

456
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,320
Every single time I hear a song, he wrote, he sang or produced. I should, I should play. I can dream about you.

457
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Let me see. If I have it, I'll play it for you right now. That would be just wonderful though.

458
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:04,320
Oops. I don't know what that is. Hold on. Let me see if I hope I have Dan Hartman.

459
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:13,280
I know I'm interrupting the hit test here, but... shoot. No. Okay. Well, I'm going to plan that for another

460
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,400
day, because that's just one of my favorite songs. Okay, back to the hit test.

461
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,320
And number two in today's hit test. It's Donna Summer. And dinner with Gershwin.

462
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:34,320
Ah, oh, I'm sorry. That was a hit.

463
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Good song.

464
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,600
Donna Summer. The second answer in today's hit test. It's also a song without a specific chorus,

465
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,840
so it's a bit hot to edit with Gershwin. Answer number two. And this is the third and final

466
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,960
answer in today's hit test. It's talked off. Yeah. And life's what you make it.

467
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,560
Where did those guys go? What a great band.

468
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:36,640
This is sooo good. Talks talk. And make it is the third and final answering today's hit test.

469
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,960

00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,520
lovely hittest. It is kind of the highlight of my day. I have to say it's fun to get the brain

So next up for me, vacuuming, then I got some calls to do. And Christina is going to go riding it for

480
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,800
clocks. They're going to pick up a school and take it to the stable. And we got to eat dinner

481
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,320
on time, which I will be preparing, because there's a teacher of parent conferences tonight

482
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,360
starting at 7 o'clock. So plenty to do. Oh man, maybe I should podcast the teacher of

483
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,520
the conference. That'd be interesting. Well, we'll see if we do that. Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow

484
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,200
right here on the daily source code. Take care everybody. Thanks for listening. Bye-bye.

485
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:20,160
I'll see you all in the next one.
