00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Daily source code for Thursday, March 24th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yo DJ!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I you don't make any more!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Transmators?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't need no stinking transmitters.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Autistic.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Autistic.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's Adam Curry.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's sunny and beautiful.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome to the Daily Source code.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Coming to you from Curry Cottage once again.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It is a podcast.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
With no commercial interruption.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now it's all sneaked in there.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Product placement.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So you'd never even know it was there.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Right?

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Source code for March 24th.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh man, I feel so much better than when I recorded yesterday's podcast.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, I was completely right.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This morning, it's about, I was at the 715 Patricia Chemical Stairs with a cup of tea.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As she all is done in the morning.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because usually she kicks me out of bed.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You know, get the day going and I'll take Christina to school.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But this morning, she brought up the tea and she said, let me guess.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You'd really love to sleep a little bit longer when she has.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think I said something like, hey, hey, hey, hey.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, so my back is completely messed up.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're not messed up.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's right.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I mean, it was almost a year ago that I had my motorcycle accident,

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
where I did really mess up my back.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And it really only acts up when I've been, let's see,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
doing all the fun things.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Flying, having sex, lazying around the house.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's completely bite.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But all the flying yesterday, you know, that's,

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that's a lot more physical than I anticipated it to be.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
All right, got a great podcast lined up for you today.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We've got a couple of promos.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're going to check in on the skinny and sports, the skinny awards.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I, I got a fever.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You know, the only thing that can cure is a little bit of cowbell.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
With some cowbell goes some guitar. Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Just purchased this one on iTunes paid 99 cents.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So enjoy it. Here's mountain.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, yeah.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, yeah.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, yeah.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's see if it's me

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Come and help me

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We'll make it easy and easy

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If I want to be a man

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hold it, I don't know

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll do what I can

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
To keep a longer bread

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll touch your neck

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll do what I can do

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll do what I can do

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll do what I can do

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
To know what I can do

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
To make it easy and easy

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll do what I can do

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll do what I can do

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll do what I can do

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh man

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, now that's so much better

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's nothing like pumping some Mississippi queen through your stereo valve processor

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anyone who's a radio or audio geek will know it

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm really a radio geek will know it

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm talking about

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know that song is that's the type of song that you would listen to

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm like radio caroline

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The AM-only pirate broadcast ships in the North Sea

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In the 70s and would sound just like that

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know that pumping and the pumping of the music

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Love it and it's such a beautiful day for something like that as well

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I mean I can see

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh man, I could probably see all the way to London

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If that's actually what London is way there

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the distance beautiful day here in Guilford, the Curry Cottage

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
With the daily source code

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh man, I was actually yelling along to that

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And as the first time I've ever bought a song off of iTunes

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I mean I had an account with iTunes for a long long time

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But you couldn't buy music purchased music in Europe

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And they finally got it done for the EU and the UK as well

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There's some controversy actually over the pricing in the UK

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because the pound is so high that 99 cents of course

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is almost you can almost get two songs to that if you're paying 99 dollar cents for it

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But whatever

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But it was a very enjoyable experience

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know to just go to iTunes, Music Store and iTunes

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Search for Mississippi Queen and my SSI SSI PPI

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then to have that return to sample it

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, that's what I want

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Purchase you want to buy, yes, one other confirmation

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And it was downloaded

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I almost made a very bad mistake of course

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have two setups here in my studio, two screens

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
One is my laptop, the other one is an old laptop that is connected to the cinema display

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And I almost downloaded on that machine

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Which is not my production machine for the source code

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I probably would have run into trouble there

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Not being able to copy to the other machine

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Maybe I could have maybe there's like a way to run it on five of your personal machines

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I didn't want to take any risk

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I just want download the song and play it

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So the experience was so beautiful

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was just like, oh man, wouldn't it be nice to those one little extra button there

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And iTunes has said, Download this to play on your podcast

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So maybe you pay two bucks

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't know, I don't care

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think 99 cents should probably cover it

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've got a lot of listeners by podcast standards

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But not by broadcast standards

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So hopefully the 99 cents will do for this time then

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That I shared it with my friends

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I promise I promise I won't do it again

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Need 20 minutes of entertainment?

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000

Beautiful

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
People who are just starting to subscribe to the daily source code

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Or saying things like

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Dude, what's with all the commercialism

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, what's with all those advertisements you play

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So what's with all the pro modes?

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You shouldn't do that, that's like commercial

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not talking about

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is what I've been doing with the

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You know, with the show from day one

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's been talking about podcasts in the community

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Other podcasts you name it, you know

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like, and stop with the plugging the eye river

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you getting paid by those guys?

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No, no, no, no, no

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The whole point is that anybody can make money that way

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There was this totally, oh man, people are like

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Skype in me, hold on a second

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let me, yeah

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So I quit it, I'll leave it on if someone

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Interesting Skype's then we'll bring them in

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, I'll just hide it though

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So yeah, I'd started with a

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cinco coffee machine, believe me, I had the

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Cinco coffee machine a long time before

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't forget if selling anything

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Through an Amazon associate account

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, it's really just to prove the concept

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It works, you can tell someone something on a podcast

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And drive them to your website

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Drive that traffic baby

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And they actually will purchase it through you

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the Cinco coffee machine really got me excited

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think the eye river is pretty logical

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I really just putting it there because people ask me

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Time and time and time again, what's your setup?

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I've been thinking now to put together a whole page with

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Everything that is in my, in my kit

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Of course, not everything is available through Amazon

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Which is kind of helping me back

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't want to just put in some replacements

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
People keep asking me about what kind of microphones I use

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And you know, I can answer the question

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A thousand times

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then a thousand times more basically

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I see I forgot one thing as a part of my show prep today

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was going to

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I've in Gmail I've set up a label for things

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want to talk about on the source code

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let me just skimmed through them and see if there's anything interesting here

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, this is something pretty cool

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is from Michael Ridley

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now, of course, I have to remember to put this into the show notes

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He's talking about mashups and he listens a couple of sites

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Again, I'll put this in the

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to start this and then we go

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll put this in the show notes at

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Create.com or daily source code.com

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Show notes of

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Mashups are obviously infringement

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Although I'm hearing a lot of noise from the creative community that

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Artists really don't mind if you mash up their stuff

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Or a lot of them don't and people seem to be kind of behind that

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But believe me

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The RIA and record companies will disagree strongly

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And he sent me this email about something

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's been talked about on the

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Folus, that's Ph.O.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So that's folus.org

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Papa Hotel, Oscar Lima, India, shareatango.org

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The idea of a client side mixing of mashups

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So I'll just read this.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The general idea is instead of the producer

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Releasing the actual finished product of the remix

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You know, MP3 or CD4, whatever

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They would use a tool

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Which would apparently be similar to Sony's acid

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I've never used acid, but I think, well,

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've never used the Sony tool acid

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And then basically that would do the mix

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So what would be distributed is just the control files

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Like in video would call that the EDL, the edit

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Decision list, you might call it

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's basically a control file

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So you have to have the originals yourself

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then you get the control data

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then it mixes the mashup on your end

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Which is a fantastic way of kind of

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Routing around the whole problem of distributing this

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I thought it was an excellent idea

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So it's almost definitely, you know,

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Think about, you know, what we can do with that

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In mashup land

245
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I would love to see if we could do that

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And if anyone knows anything about Sony acid

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let me know what that is

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Or any other cool remixing tools

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've been hearing some things about this

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So I guess it's obviously

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Something that people are digging

252
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let me just go here

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Interesting story

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Says Wayne Pittenger

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
About the state of airport security

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
My wife's friend visited us in Pennsylvania

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
From Florida before she flew up there

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She packed their duffle bag with 80 plastic easter eggs

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Packed with various prizes for an easter egg hunter

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Husband had warned her that it might not get through security

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
With a duffle full of easter eggs

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Despite of that she went through air support

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Airport security and the flight north

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Without as much as a search through the duffle

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
She still had to have her shoes checked though

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I love that

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I know there's another one I want to talk about

268
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hold on, let's go back to the source code

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh my second

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm going to read this one

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
After here we go

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
First I want you to hear this

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This is a

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
A podcast

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is the way

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Any podcast that I'm just going to

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Listen to and subscribe to immediately

279
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's definitely going to start off like this one

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Check this out

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's Saturday, January

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
22, 2005

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Welcome to Mike's Lifecast

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hello

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
There

287
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I love it

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Welcome to Mike's Lifecast

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Clear

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Basically he's in his airplane

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And he does a whole sound seeing tour of touching goes

292
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's awesome

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It was like

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And the sound is so phenomenal

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let me just

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Check this out

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Listen to a little bit of him do it

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Listen to a little bit of him do it

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't go to my little bit

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And he can do it

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
First we're at

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
30,000 feet

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
First we're at

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well you should listen to that

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Mike's Lifecast

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Check it out from

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
From the show notes or to ipotter.org

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Really really really enjoyed that

309
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Thank you very much for making my day

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But from deep inside the underbelly of Chicago

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Comes a show with more belly

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Than Tony Suprano

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Not a big pussy

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But sort of a slight cat

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This tool on the podcast is your buddy

316
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fat Matt

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The events of the day

318
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A mash of or two

319
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Fat Matt chats with Scott

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And they sometimes were blue

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The Fat Matt show

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Podcast to the world

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mattonair.com is the source of the code

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That might make you hurt

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you liked on and drew

326
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And you like a good chuckle

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Here's a podcast

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's new

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
With a very loose buckle

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The Fat Matt show

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Visit matonair.com for the source code

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Are you driving around?

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then he goes into a whole bunch of examples

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Sounds like a pretty good show

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Haven't subscribed to it yet

336
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But I certainly will on the next

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
On the next scan

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He has going back to the aviation cell

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I got a great email from Christopher Stork

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Excuse me

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh man

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I won't tell you what I'm doing

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Bob, Bob, I'm here

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey Adam, you were my sitter in the 80s

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When I told the folks I was too sick for school

346
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Bummer though is my 24 year old wife

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Listening to the data source code

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He says Adam, who?

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Alright buddy

350
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Thanks

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Did you want to do Rob the cradle here?

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then anyway, since it sounds like an aviation buff

353
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Thought you'd like this

354
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm a captain on an ERJ145

355
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
For US Regional Airlines

356
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I plug my iPod into the observer audio panel

357
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,120
panel and listen to the daily source code on long flights at 37,000 feet. You come in through

358
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,080
our headphones and keep us entertained like the lone ranger did for our folks. Man, thank

359
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,880
you as a big compliment. With $16 million worth of airplanes strapped to my ass at next generation

360
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,920
radio content in my ears, I like to think I'm flying into the future. My god, let me know that,

361
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:20,280
you know, we should do that differently. We should do that differently. We should do that line again.

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,960
That was going on. Okay, I guess it was a good idea. We're not going to do it. I'll do one more time now.

363
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,200
With $16 million worth of airplanes strapped to my ass and the next generation radio content in my

364
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:45,480
ears, I like to think I'm flying into the future. As the sun set last night, we were on top of thin layer of

365
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,040
clouds around flight level 350 when the last whisp of light fell under the deck and the stars popped out

366
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,040
above. It was if we were on the edge of the atmosphere. For a second, we were major Tom and you

367
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,960
ground control. Unfortunately, as I enjoyed that moment, my flight attendant called up to say some

368
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:14,440
dude was Yakkan in the aisle. Man, that's very cool. Chris, thank you very much. That's a wonderful

369
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,440
email and it just tickles me to think that you guys are checking this stuff out at 30s. It's flight

370
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,400
level 35. That's great. Excellent. Really appreciate the email. All right, let me see. What's

371
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:32,440
going to talk about? Oh, yeah, no, we're doing all this bokeh stuff. You know, it's a, you know,

372
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,480
run a nice set of company in 1990. Actually, he joined me in 1995 with the company that we then

373
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:47,960
folded into the company we eventually took public in 96. And I paid less attention than, as I

374
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,880
did now, to this, this magical thing that people call the business model. And you have many business

375
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:01,000
models and, and, you know, in this bare essence, it sounds like, okay, it's, you know, it's a,

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,800
it's a, you know, it's a way to make money. It's something comes in and you keep some as a whole

377
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,200
bunch goes out. But in the five years that Ron and I have been, you know, in contact with

378
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,040
having been doing anything, man, he's really gotten good at this spreadsheet stuff. And when it comes

379
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,560
to what we're in the process of developing for podshow.com and some other properties is,

380
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,480
I mean, it's great to see how this is really going to work. I mean, it's, it's for real. We finally

381
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,280
come up with, you know, a way to do things that have numbers there that really work for everybody. And

382
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:44,040
I think that this, yeah, this is going to be a new form of, I mean, the only word for it is commercialism.

383
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,760
I realize that. But it seems so, so clear and so clean. It's, it's just, it's pretty transparent.

384
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,320
I like it very much. And, and I like the fact that everybody can participate and that we're not

385
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,200
locking anyone in or out by any locks, like distribution locks or anything proprietary. It's just,

386
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,880
you know, how hard you're willing to work, the quality of the work you're going to bring,

387
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,880
what's your product going to be, you know, how good is your product going to be or your service

388
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,760
or combination. I think combination is probably best. And I'm really pumped about,

389
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,560
about moving this forward and getting stuff going pretty soon. One thing that that I've been

390
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,280
concentrating a lot on behind the scenes is I potted out org. This, of course, is not really a

391
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,080
directory in the, in the, in the, in the sense of the word that you may know it. We may think about it.

392
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,320
But more as a resource, I think the main resource is that at the back end of that server comes

393
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,800
an OPML file that anyone can use for their iPod or applications or podcasting applications.

394
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,680
And in fact, you can use it to start your own directory, which is great. And, and there are many

395
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,960
people who do that. But I haven't thinking about how we can make iPod.org a lot more functional.

396
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,920
And that's, that's obviously, you know, it's very clear what needs to be done there. I've already

397
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,720
spoken about what we'll be doing with the, with the category node editors that they'll have

398
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:11,720
many more tools to, to work on their space and to, you know, really be able to do good categorization

399
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,200
and and build a community around the node. With that come, of course, some community tools,

400
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,360
which would be an obvious one is a forum for a, I guess I should say, a community voting.

401
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,080
That's a big one. And I would definitely say search is going to be extremely important, which is always,

402
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:40,440
you know, the thought that I've had behind show notes in OPML. And maybe I'm wrong about this,

403
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,000
maybe it's not necessary at all. But I feel that for somehow an extension of show notes outside of,

404
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,800
you know, just a description tag that you put into your blog post was going to be something

405
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:58,280
we would be desirable because in an OPML file, basically, let's use an outliner to create a

406
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,360
document, a text document, but it formats it on, on the back end as an XML file. So that's very

407
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,880
easy to parse and to, I guess, to index. So I think there's two, two kinds of search. One is,

408
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,200
you know, I'm looking for a show, you know, that I'm looking for dawn and drew, for instance,

409
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,960
or I'm looking for a show about, you know, a risk-a podcast. And then specifically in the show notes,

410
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,800
and that should draw all the way down into the ID3 tags of the file itself. And there should be

411
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,520
some consistency there. So these are things that will really make a great resource, you know,

412
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,880
a good resource to a great resource to have these, these pieces put in there. And I'll tell you,

413
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:46,600
right off the bat, we're not going to be building that. What was that? No, I'd say we'd probably

414
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,440
be doing some interesting, some interesting deals with people who already have that.

415
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,000
That I'm curious, and the listeners of the Daily Source Code, I need your help. That sound,

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,720
that was the sound of my wife running away screaming. You see, the fact is, I'm boring her to

417
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,200
death lately. I'm a geek, and she's not. She gets tired of hearing me go on and on and on and on

418
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,240
about tech and tech news. So you can help me out. Give me an outlet, listen to my podcast, give me

419
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,520
somebody to talk to, talk tech with, let's build a community. I just got one question for you.

420
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,800
Are you a geek? If you can answer yes to that question, you might like my podcast. So check it out at

421
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:39,000
www.areogeek.com. Oh, man. Well, you know, where's the hot or not podcast? You know, that's,

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,440
that's what we need. Where's the podcast dating service? Come on, people get it together. That's

423
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,920
great. I'm a geek. I'm proud to admit it. I am. I just let my wife dress me up pretty once in a

424
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,720
while. That's all you got to do. You know, let them clean up once in a while and then and give you

425
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,240
that, you know, that salmon Dave haircut. No, whatever. Yeah, let them do all that. Be a Barbie doll.

426
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,040
And then that's cool. You've got to cross over to the dark side once in a while.

427
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,640
Skinny on sports, fastest 10 minutes on your iPod, my favorite sports podcast. It's

428
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,640
Skinny on sports dot com. They put together the first sports award show podcast that I know of at

429
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,040
least. So go ahead, email me and tell me you were first. The human rented it. You invented a

430
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:31,240
award shows. What they did is it's very cool. They got a whole bunch of really well-known

431
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,920
podcasters. To basically do category categories of awards and had them all recorded. Oh, no,

432
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm sorry. It wasn't pre-recorded. It was all happened in life, right? Just like Michael Geek,

433
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,920
Michael Butler, Rockin' Roll Geek, that turned off. That's not the venue.

434
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,720
Next, we're going to have to move outside where the pre-party and the post-party for the Skinny's

435
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,800
are going to be happening. Michael Butler is outside there with American heartbreak. And you know,

436
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,160
he always shows up with a full-on-terogent tonight at Skinny's. That's no exception. Michael, take it away.

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:18,680
I just blew it all away from San Francisco. And I got to take it. Boy, oh my god, I'm so tired.

438
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,800
Okay, so make sure you check that out. Don and Drew showed up. Michael Gohagan,

439
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,360
Dave Slusher, you know, the the pod squads there and full effect. It's definitely something you

440
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,400
got to check out. Skinny on sports, the first annual Skinny Awards. And my friend Kai Chesent me this,

441
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,760
she Skype instant message this, this MP3 to me. I've heard this before. It's a Monty Python

442
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,960
comedy skit. Although I don't think it's an actual one of the cast members who does the voice.

443
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,200
But it's something that if you haven't heard it, you just got to hear it again. It's only two and a

444
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:10,600
half minutes. It's not safe for work. And it is titled, what is it? The meaning of the word fuck.

445
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,760
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word fuck.

446
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,240
Out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F, fuck is the only word that is referred to

447
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:39,800
as the F word. It's the one magical word. Just by its sound, can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.

448
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,760
Fuck, as most words in the English language is derived from German, the word freaking which means

449
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:54,680
to strike. In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories as a transit of verb, for instance,

450
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:02,440
John fucks Shirley. As an intransitive verb, Shirley fucks. It's meanings not always sexual.

451
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,320
It can be used as an adjective, such as John's doing all the fucking work. As part of an adverb,

452
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:16,920
Shirley talks to fucking much. As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, Shirley is fucking beautiful.

453
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:25,560
As a noun, I don't give a fuck. As part of a word, absolutely, or in fucking credible.

454
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,680
And, as almost every word in a sentence, fuck the fucking fuckers.

455
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,240
As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck. As in these examples,

456
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,640
describing situations such as fraud, I got fucked up a used carlaught. This may,

457
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,800
oh, fuck it. Trouble. I guess I'm really fucked now. Aggression. Don't fuck with me, buddy.

458
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Difficulty. I don't understand this fucking question. Inquiry. Who the fuck was that?

459
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,680
This satisfaction. I don't like what the fuck is going on here. In confidence, he's a fuck off.

460
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,040
This missile. Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself?

461
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,840
I'm sure you can think of many more examples. With all of these multipurpose applications,

462
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,960
how can anyone be offended when you use the word? We say, use this unique flexible word,

463
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,800
more often than your daily speech. It will identify the quality of your character immediately.

464
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Say it loudly and proudly. Fuck you.

465
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,560
You know, that's one of those audio clips that circulates around the radio business every

466
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,280
couple of years. It got sent to me, as I said, just today. I figured I'd let you into the family.

467
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,280
If you hadn't heard that before, you know, now you remember that secret society. All you need to hear

468
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,000
now is the infamous KCK some dead puppy long distance dedication in your set.

469
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,000
I am again. All right, but another hit test. We're going to start right away. This is number one.

470
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,000
Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. You did that twice. Sharp breast man.

471
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,840
G G top. Yep, reminding you to tell you that my G G top is number two.

472
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Don't waste my time. It's either things that don't waste my time.

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,680
Okay. Say, say, say, say. This is a good one, John. I like him. Michael Jackson. Say, say, say,

474
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,280
down in before the bell. And time's up and the yardy answers this is answer number one. Okay.

475
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,880
Uh, like a tie. It's the season top. It's sharp, dressed man.

476
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,880
Listen black tie.

477
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,280
My favorite part of the record. Uh, just play it.

478
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:36,040
And number two. Hey, very distinctive sounds. The sound of bad habits. This is Jimmy

479
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Virgin. That's the song I meant, actually. Look at half a point.

480
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,960
Why can't I remember all the lyrics? Not the title of the song.

481
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,960
It's going to be easy.

482
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,720
Jenny birthday answer number two in today's hit test. And this is answer number three.

483
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,720
Oh, McCartney together with the trouble Michael Jackson.

484
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,240
This is, say, say, say, say. I guess I want to have a point for that too.

485
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,760
I want to say Michael Jackson.

486
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,960
Well, the reaction.

487
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,880
Answer number three. Full McCartney in Michael Jackson.

488
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,400
Well, let's hit again for today. It's a quick hit test.

489
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,280
You know what to do with the hit test at gmail.com. And you've been finding information at G and

490
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,680
the OLHE. And that stands for young folk at death in L. But I don't see you next time for another hit

491
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:16,120
missed. Bye. Bye. Actually, uh, so actually, as I sang along with that song reminded me

492
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,760
something we did on the on the radio show in the morning show that didn't haunt.

493
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,440
You know, uh, how sometimes you'll think that lyric goes a certain way and you'll be singing it,

494
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,400
but it's completely wrong. And it turns out to be actually pretty funny.

495
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,600
If you've had that happen to you, who's that? Oh, it's Ron Bloom. I'll tell you what. So we should

496
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,400
we put him on the show. Do that. So joining joining us now on the daily source code from Miami

497
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:51,480
Florida, it's Ron Bloom. Good morning. South Beach. I'm sorry. I'm in South Beach. I'm sorry for the

498
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,520
faux pas. It's just another planet. Hey, dude, how you doing? All right, man. How's it going?

499
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,760
Yeah, it's good. Daily source code land. Yeah, I just finished up the hit test almost done with a show.

500
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:09,560
You guys clear what a revival. 1983. What's the question? Uh, uh, what, uh,

501
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,240
band that John Fogretty played in. Is that it? Yeah, John Fogretty. Do I get another one?

502
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,680
Well, once it once was the largest band in the world. What? CCR? Yeah, so we did.

503
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,760
Didn't you get into like a big fight with Warner Brothers or something? Yeah, you know, they should

504
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,240
form a label with Springsteen. What do you mean Springsteen's in the same trouble? He went through

505
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,840
the thing where he couldn't record for five years and creed instead of that sort of kind of thing.

506
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Yeah, well, so did Prince and wasn't that all was, so it wasn't all Warner Brothers then.

507
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,440
Yeah, just just artists being themselves. Mm-hmm. Anything to report, Ron, or uh,

508
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,560
if you could talk about it, you got any damage announcement? Yeah, I got any damage announcements,

509
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,520
did. Hey, come on, all the kids are doing it. You today. I think I can tell you that things look great.

510
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,640
And it was just fun. I was jumping around a room like a one-legged man that announced kick in front.

511
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,320
Oh, one of those days, huh? Yeah. Okay. Things are going well. Okay, cool. I'll uh,

512
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll call in and check you later. I just wanted to check it and see how the show was going. Okay,

513
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,480
but thank you very much. Dr. Lateron. Bye bye. Yes, ladies and gentlemen. Okay, so there you have it.

514
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,040
First hand, he's excited. What was that excited as a one-legged man in a

515
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,720
ass-kicking contest? I'm not quite sure what that man. But anyway,

516
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,480
remind me to tell you this easy top story some other time. Okay.
