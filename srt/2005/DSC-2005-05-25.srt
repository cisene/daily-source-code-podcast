1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
this is the daily source code episode 184 it is well let's see 1239 that's

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,800
past midnight it is the 25th of May 2005 coming to you from Palo Alto

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:25,720
California from the lovely creekside in which is actually a pretty a pretty

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,280
dynamite little hotel oh boy let me tell you I'm sorry I'm already blowing

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,280
into the microphone it's been another extremely long day and I apologize that

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm not able to bring you a source code with you know the promos that I

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,920
that I love to bring you and the pod safe music and the mashups and all

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,080
the fun stuff but the the hotel that we're in and by the way most hotels are

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,160
pretty full here in Palo Alto before we stayed in San Francisco of course there's

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,960
a lot more capacity there for for people staying overnight or a couple of

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:16,040
nights Palo Alto just seems to be pretty much booked up and this hotel has a

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,320
free internet which is great unfortunately you get what you pay for I'm not

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,200
quite sure what's going on but it seems like the connectivity drops out you

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,080
know every five minutes or so it'll drop out for a couple of seconds which is

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,680
just enough to mess up any Skype call you happen to be making requiring a

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,840
readile team mobile by the way which is what I have here in the states for my

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,840
cell phone is almost non-existent in this area so I guess we're roaming on what is

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,040
it singular cellular and the whole on second this is Paris Hilton's new

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:17,440
commercial home just check I love Paris Hilton I got to tell you she's

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,000
she's smart she's really smart now okay so what's the controversy guys she's

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,480
washing her Bentley

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:39,200
okay whatever so because of that it's very difficult to download stuff and because

23
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,360
we're pretty much on the road all day there's just no other opportunity and we

24
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,680
just got back from dinner about about forty five minutes ago I didn't

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,520
was Steve Gilmore who was in the neighborhood so whatever one San Francisco

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,640
Steve seems to be in the neighborhood by the way oh and before I forget to

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,960
night so that's Wednesday night at seven o'clock there's a San Francisco podcast

28
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,200
there's meetup hosted by Michael Butler rock and roll geek I I really would

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,120
like to go but I think that Ron and I are gonna have to hop a flight for Los

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,440
Angeles Wednesday night so that's obviously I'm recording this Tuesday night

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,120
but officially Wednesday morning so we're gonna try but because of all the

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,520
mess up in with the America West in Phoenix and and we just had to shuffle a

33
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,960
whole bunch of stuff around so I just I figured update you know this is

34
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,040
sometimes I'd like to post stuff on the blog just in in text and I just

35
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,920
have no energy for it so I'm actually lying in bed watching TV or another

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,600
drawback of this hotel no porn channels that's a wait a minute what's this

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,240
button ACH what's that just gives you the previous channel no porn

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,400
channels not that I'd watch that or anything like that I noticed that what is this

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,760
new program on television I did may not be new CJ I know what stands for

40
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,440
it's kind of like an entertainment tonight and now they've got where they

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,080
got this Phil Spectre trial you don't hear a lot about Michael Jackson these

42
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,280
days except from the CJ show I see like a daily update of Michael Jackson

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,720
trial and now that he seems to have a have an upper hand and that well his

44
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,320
team is really attacking his accuser particularly the mother and it's not

45
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,040
looking too good for her man and you know what right Lisa I told you I've been

46
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,480
supporting Michael Jackson on this all the way and in a sitting till proven

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:55,640
guilty right so this morning started off very early we had breakfast with someone

48
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,080
who I've known for let's see 12 years but a never met and person so when

49
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:11,360
who was pivotal in my mind pivotal in in early internet days and created created

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,880
some stuff that has really you know been a big benefit to people all over the

51
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,680
world I'll tell you a little before I tell you who it is the story is in 1993 I

52
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,320
had registered MTV dot com by the way that was with total approval and knowledge

53
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,160
of MTV and I was running something called a go-for server this is before the

54
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,200
worldwide web and a go-for server it was basically a text based linking

55
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:45,720
system with menu so you'd have a menu of you could basically determine how

56
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,240
how many different options there were on each menu on a screen so you know

57
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,840
numbered one through whatever and if you either hit a number key or if you used

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,680
your cursor keys you could navigate to a link essentially that could take you

59
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,560
to another go-for server or to a or to a page of information or picture and it

60
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,000
was it was pretty much a hyper linking system and I remember getting an email

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
which of course at the time was something pretty new as well if you ever listened

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to the MTV Chronicles cast that can Clark and I have done we've done three now

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,960
we're still another one by the way she's like a fourth wrap up on that

64
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,600
I was going to say

65
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,240
shoot oh anyway so I had my adamant mtv dot com at the time I received an

66
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,960
email and said hey Adam really love what you're doing with the go-for stuff

67
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,480
you know you should check this out because this will add pictures and and

68
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,960
some layout capabilities for your screen and included with it was

69
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,120
I think it was and maybe even an attachment at the time you you encoded if

70
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,880
you remember those days some of you might of something called HTTPD I think

71
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,360
it was version one dot three and that email was from Mark and Riesen and he

72
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,120
many of you remember started at the University of Champagne or Bona and Illinois

73
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,400
with the first browser which was Mosaic and later of course he went on to

74
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,240
create Netscape and I remember that that day when I was like you know and I

75
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,960
actually installed it myself my own server was a headless sun three and there was

76
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,240
this mosaic software and you had you know a couple of sites you could go to

77
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,760
it also could do go-for links by the way and FTP links it could

78
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,680
understood that as well and I remember like you know looking at this page and

79
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,560
saw all these boxes with blue outlines and all of a sudden pictures started to

80
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,200
appear and it was just a such an eye opener and and of course Mark thought that

81
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,760
you know I would be into this because MTV was a highly visual medium and we're

82
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,260
moving from text into pictures and it was funny because at breakfast this

83
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,560
morning we were talking about that and he said man you know back in those days

84
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,400
I had had like a big target on my forehead and people were so angry because

85
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,600
they said pictures gonna ruin the web and you're you're ruining our our

86
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,920
medium and get out of here and stop this and you're bad and you're evil and I

87
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,320
don't think anyone can say that that pictures turned out to be evil on the

88
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,760
unit well some pictures arguably but so it was good kind of reminiscing and

89
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:40,000
I never met him and we met at a place in downtown Palo Alto is it downtown I

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,160
guess yeah called the most at the creamery and this guy's tall he's tall

91
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,000
than I am like man you're a big he's like well I didn't know you were this

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,200
tall either but he's these bigger than I am that was pretty interesting and

93
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,800
that was funny you know and he's a big satellite radio fan he has he has

94
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,920
serious as well as XM I believe and you know we're talking about music and

95
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,760
he's got a new company which I think is actually located above the

96
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,960
creamery and he promised me that when he's ready to talk about it he'll come

97
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,560
on the source code and he'll do it in person or we'll do it through Skype and

98
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,000
he'll let us know what he's up to and what's going on so it was really fun

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,840
that was just the kind of a feel good meeting you know we're in town and

100
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,880
and able to hook up and it was cool it was cool meeting him and let me see

101
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,640
oh man what this is so much to talk about throughout the day by the way I had an

102
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,920
opportunity to listen to KU radio which is the AM station here in the Bay Area that

103
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,620
is broadcasting podcast it's interesting I don't think they're actually doing

104
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,720
podcast 100% of the time it's well there's a lot of imaging and and sound

105
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,520
stuff that you know kind of positions it has open source radio there's a lot of

106
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,320
that a lot of music notice that and it sounded like that there still had some

107
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,680
some kind of other stuff in between in fact was very hard for us to I didn't

108
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,440
know the frequency off hand was searching around trying to find it and must have

109
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,160
skipped over to couple times either because they were in commercials or there

110
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,920
was it sounded like a very typical you know dial-in talk show or something that

111
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,600
was going on so that was a little bit confusing and most of the podcast and of

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,960
course in lots of podcasts we we mentioned dates you know it's like 15th of

113
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,880
March 20th of March and I guess that's the process of basically the submission

114
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,520
process that they have to deal with is you know they have to listen to everything

115
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,280
or approve and screen everything before it goes out because of the the

116
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,080
the obviously the decency or indecency laws but it was pretty cool it was

117
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,480
interesting to listen to that and not not much different from pod show and

118
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,800
serious except that's more current and we have you know the concept of

119
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,760
promos which is something I don't hear a lot of on KU radio but it was very

120
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:24,400
interesting to listen to it then we met with oh this is interesting a couple of

121
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,600
was it last week what's it last week as before I left actually I heard on

122
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,160
morning coffee notes the day wine or does he was talking about a gentleman named

123
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,400
Randy commissar who is with a venture capital firm

124
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:47,200
kind of Perkins here in San Francisco in the Valley and

125
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,040
what Dave was saying I'm paraphrasing of course is that a company like a

126
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,800
cleaner person should sponsor some of the legacy of Silicon Valley and a good

127
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,120
place to do that would be on the Gilmore gang and so when I met Randy and he

128
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,360
said you know I spoke to Dave and we talked for a while about podcasting and I

129
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,000
said yeah I know he said oh really yeah because Dave podcast he hadn't heard

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,600
Dave's podcast so I also know that he suggested you know you sponsor the Gilmore

131
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,840
gang and he said yeah yeah that'd be great as well I'll be submitting a proposal

132
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:32,960
for you tomorrow so that actually might pan out and and if it does I'll make sure

133
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,680
that the Dave gets a commission on it that was it was it was it was a great loop

134
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,640
closing there was a lot of fun let me see what did I write down here oh meanwhile

135
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,760
in New York Madge Weinstein was visiting New York you probably saw that Madge

136
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,120
did an interview with the famous famous drag queen bunny and I just saw

137
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,520
that that was up and posted excuse me but I'd also hooked Madge up with the

138
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,680
tour of the serious satellite radio studio facilities and spoke to her as she was

139
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,840
on her way back to Chicago and she said oh I'll add him so wonderful I met all

140
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,600
these old guys these radio stars and celebrities and she'd basically did a

141
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,360
sound seeing tour and hopefully that'll be up in the in the next day or so I

142
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,760
cannot wait to hear how that one over just haven't Madge walking through the

143
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:37,520
serious satellite radio studios I must have been pretty interesting let's see I

144
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,920
just going through a couple of things I wrote down just because I wanted to

145
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:49,760
update you on everything that's happening tomorrow see tomorrow we have a follow-up

146
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,720
meeting at Apple and Cooper T no never been to Apple which is interesting because

147
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,960
I've you know I always say that I'm a beta tester for Apple products ever since

148
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,040
the Mac Plus essentially and I've always paid for the privilege to be

149
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,120
into beta test all the Apple products so it's going to be great to kind of

150
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,240
get a little bit of the vibe of the company and of course this is a meeting

151
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,400
about you know what's coming in iTunes what I'm going to ask them is since there's

152
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,360
so much noise about this and and so much talk going on and I can see that

153
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,920
there's a lot of confusion in some cases and some things are just you know

154
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,600
it's just not a love information out there but I think there's enough that I

155
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,200
I'd like to ask them if I can talk a little bit more about what they're going

156
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,120
to be doing and if I look at my calendar I say and this Steve Jobs is pretty

157
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,200
good for if he says 60 days when something's going to be released you can

158
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,600
pretty much bet it's going to be 60 days so let's say that's T minus 57 and

159
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,360
counting so looking forward to being able to talk a little bit more about

160
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,080
that just to I think the community deserves the podcast and community deserves

161
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,080
note what's going on because it's going to affect us all in very very positive

162
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,080
ways so that's tomorrow then we're going to hop on a plane and go to Los Angeles

163
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,880

164
