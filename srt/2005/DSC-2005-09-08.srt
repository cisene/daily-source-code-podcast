00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Delta Chericharly 2-3-7

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
They are your secrets!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I information you don't get out of them!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Adam Curry

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
With $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Done the next generation radio content in my ears!

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future!

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And it's September 8th, 2005!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome to the Daily Source code!

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The Power of the Lord!

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, Surrey Bob!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Shit lagged!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh boy, the honeymoon is over between me and Virgin Atlantic!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We're talking about that today!

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Just stepped off the plane!

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
From New York, I'm back in the cottage in Gilford, Surrey, the United Kingdom!

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's good to be back home!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We also have to talk about some of the connectivity problems that

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Basically, with help me from even getting all of my show notes up on the server

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Properly, that was a major hotel snafu!

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I must say though, I'm very pleased with the Yamaha Professional Audio Workstation AW16G

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's an unpacked, beautifully in New York, performed perfectly!

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And came back through open suitcase, which was not checked by TSA this time, right?

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At least they didn't even have a friendly little note behind me!

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That'll have to wait!

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't even go home and shit starts ringing!

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah, there's a Skype Upgrade!

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And now, that's got all kinds of cool features that are ringing off the hook!

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've got plenty of email to look through!

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
For the next, I'm going to try and keep it in 30 minutes!

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This will be your Daily Source code!

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You've got brand new Podsafe music coming up from Rob Costlo!

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
See, I've got a couple of promo for you!

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And as I said, some stuff to talk about the trip to New York!

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And obviously, some email that came into the Gmail still skirted at 99%.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Kick it off though!

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We've got a mashup!

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Team 9!

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This was actually from mashuptown.com.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is the perfect mashup for after a long weekend, such as the previous holiday weekend!

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Baby mashup!

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Belinda Carlisle and Graham Coxon on the Daily Source code!

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And then it's supposed to...

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What the hell is that?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, that was lame!

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How come I didn't work?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me see!

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That was really weird!

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought I had an old program!

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, I could start the show over, but this is...

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'd say this is too much fun!

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, I see!

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know what?

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It really helps if you put the mashup in the lineup!

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We've got a lot of fun!

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000

We've got a lot of fun!

165
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm out!

166
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,760
I remember one of that Ballina Carlale song, and saw the video came out with that inflatable

167
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
blow.

168
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
It was quite a rock jam though.

169
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,960
I remember that.

170
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,760
I mean, a team nine gets you going after the long weekend with that mash out, Ballina

171
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Carlale, Graham Cox, and sorry for that, it's a very unprofessional moment before we

172
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,660
rolled into the song.

173
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,500
Let's just chalk that one up to the jet lag.

174
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,140
And of course, as always, and when we have bandwidth, I'll be uploading everything in the

175
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,780
show notes, all the links, all the MP3s to the promos, and of course this came from

176
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,780
a mashuptown.com.

177
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,340
I found out that AWSart from mashuptown.com is Dr. Art.

178
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
How about that, huh?

179
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,340
It's always the doctors and your dentists and your next-door neighbor, lawyer, who's doing it,

180
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,540
all that legal stuff.

181
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,300
Okay, I mentioned the honeymoon was over with Virgin Atlantic.

182
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,340
Yeah, I mean, it's not entirely over, but I was very disappointed.

183
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,740
Told you on the way over what a great trip it was in the upper-class suite and completely

184
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,980
lined flat on the bed, and a nice little note, personal note from Sir Richard with the

185
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
email address.

186
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,060
I'm definitely going to email them now, because here's what I did.

187
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,300
I thought, you know what I'm going to do.

188
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,380
I'm going to take the 1110 PM flight back from New York, so I had some time to hang out

189
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,340
with a couple people, and I went over to Sirius, Sirius Radio, and it's been mostly

190
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,860
the afternoon there, and I definitely want to tell you about that.

191
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,220
And I thought, you know, what I'll do is I'll have dinner with the Steve Leeds from Sirius.

192
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,300
We've talked, it's Steve's been on the show before.

193
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:50,460
Rock and roll in radio, legend, Steve Leeds, and you know, then I'll head off to JFK, and

194
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,500
then I'll get on the plane, and I'll go to sleep, and then I'll get up, and it'll be like

195
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,740
11 o'clock, and I'll have to head a short, but a good night's sleep.

196
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,820
And I got on the plane, it's like, wait a minute, this isn't, this is not a Boeing, this

197
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,180
is an Airbus A340, I think it was a three, yeah, A340, and like, whoa, hold on a second,

198
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,860
these seats, although they do recline, this is the old model.

199
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,260
This is what they used to have before, and it's far from the suite, the bed doesn't recline

200
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,260
completely flat, it kind of goes down on an angle, it's really weird sensation, it first

201
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,340
that the chair goes down about about a foot into its encasing, and then it kind of goes

202
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,180
down, but your feet kind of touch the floor, well, it just didn't work for me, I had my eyes

203
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,780
close for most of the trip, but I don't think I was in a very deep sleep at all, I had

204
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,700
been a nice little sleeper suit down, that was kind of cool, and everyone was very nice,

205
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,180
and they all understood that it sucked, I think if, you know, if you're going to pay the

206
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,780
same amount for a flight with a, with a, with a sleeper suite, then if you don't get

207
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,900
the sleeper suite, it should be cheaper, that's all, so I'm, you know, I'm going back

208
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,100
to New York Tuesday, I believe, and so that's the big trip, right, the big trip for the

209
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:14,540
rest of this month is New York, then on Tuesday, then Wednesday, to San Francisco, then the

210
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,100
Tuesday after that, back to O2 Chicago, then back to San Francisco, then to New York,

211
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,740
and then back home to London, so it's going, and that's going to take me through the rest

212
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,060
of the month, so it's going to be, it's going to be pretty busy, but I've got the workstation

213
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,060
with me, and the actually, before I left, even before I went over to Syria, satellite radio,

214
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:37,980
I went to Sam, Ash, music in New York, legendary, any musician, it's ever been in New York

215
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,660
or it's ever heard of New York, and knows of Sam Ash, it's, what a great store, and I was

216
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:51,100
really looking for a similar set up, a similar mixing board, as the Yamaha, but I wanted to be

217
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,380
just a tad smaller, and I had like five sales guys, and of course there are musicians and gear

218
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,620
heads, and so they were totally into the whole concept, and it just doesn't exist, not on a

219
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,300
smaller scale, this Yamaha is the best I can do for now, because you can get the, you can get

220
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,180
mixers with built-in hard drives and effects and processing and dynamics, but then it only has

221
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,940
two inputs, which means you can either do a stereo signal, for example, from the laptop or you can do

222
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:25,740
two mono microphones, but you can't do a mic and have a stereo signal on any of them that I saw

223
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,060
that were of any smaller size, so that's too bad, but as a holding a market, you know, a whole

224
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,020
by the way, the cast blaster fills up just very nicely on the software side, hold on, you know what,

225
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,180
I just mentioned that, I better put a link in the show notes there to cast blaster, perfect,

226
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,060
and then let's see, so I told you about the meetings we had in New York, those were all great,

227
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,700
but on a pawn checkout, and I didn't tell you what hotel I was in, I was in the

228
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,180
St. Regis Club at XSX House on Central Park South, which was an expedient offer, and so it looked

229
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,180
like a really nice hotel, and you know, it said, some rooms have Park View, I got the partial

230
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,340
Park View Room, I think I've mentioned that, and you press your nose up against one of the windows,

231
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,500
and it kind of looked at the right there, and then you could just see the Park, but it was great hotel,

232
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:25,020
you know, the price was very affordable, like $250, I think $270, of course you get tax and all that

233
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,860
crap, and you know, room service or whatever, and so the plan was, you know, check out around

234
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,380
noon, one o'clock, and then I was going to head over to to serious, and I was going to walk,

235
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,780
which I did with my, oh man, like, I've so much, it's so many things, I'm gonna tell you about so much,

236
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,460
but the checkout, so I, I was going to check my bag and leave it there and come back, let

237
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,380
you know, around 8 o'clock when I was going to go to the airport, so I go to the cashier,

238
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,220
and it's just beautiful black woman, it was helping me check out, and just stunning, really,

239
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,340
smooth, skin, beautiful smile, really friendly, and of course the inevitable question came,

240
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:07,980
when she said, did you enjoy your stay, and I said, well, you know, yeah, except I won't come back,

241
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,380
if the internet isn't fixed, because it was so slow that I couldn't get any work done,

242
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,020
I couldn't, I just couldn't upload my files, it was, you know, it was worse than a modem speed,

243
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,420
she said, yeah, I know there's something wrong and it's been that way for a couple of days,

244
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,260
so well, it's someone working on it, she said, I don't know, you know, she does talk to the tech

245
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,980
guys, and they were maybe upgrading something, or you know, it wasn't quite clear, and of course,

246
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,340
I cracked the joke and I said, well, you know, it's going on, is that someone's downloading porn,

247
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,220
or they got some freaking porn server up and rolling, you know, that's what it looks like,

248
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,100
because the, the inbound bandwidth was okay, but the outbound bandwidth was almost completely gone,

249
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,860
so, and she laughed and she said, oh, you made my day, and I was so funny about the porn

250
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,900
comments, you said, you know what's interesting, she said, as she's completing my bill, she said,

251
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,700
I know the tech guys, and they don't really know this, but I know all the codes to the movie,

252
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,140
so I know exactly what movies you saw. My brain, of course, goes a thousand miles an hour,

253
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,140
I like, and she's, and she's snickering, I said, well, you see, I couldn't download any porn,

254
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
so I had to get it one way the other.

255
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,900
Were you a fan of Doctor Who? In that case, you need to listen to Doctor Who, Parachark.

Hot chill. Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

261
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,620
Hi, this is Kevin Crossman from the Frappac podcast. You know the Frappac, all those guys in this

267
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,180
Call us now. I apologize, I'm all over the map today, it's I didn't cue anything up, it's

268
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,740
the dedication though. So just about that story that I was talking about before, those promos,

269
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,980
needless to say, I was probably pretty embarrassed. So anyway, she promised me the internet

270
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,380
would be fixed. So we'll see, I'm planning on going there Tuesday again, if not,

271
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:57,260
that will be held to pay. And right, so then I walked from Central Park South to Avenue of the

272
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,500
Americas where the serious building is, which is on 48th, I think, 49th Street is the entrance.

273
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,620
And a hustle and a bustle there, man, they're getting ready for Howard Stern to show up, and

274
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,020
they're building a studio, and it's all boarded up inside, so you can't see what the new studio

275
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,580
is going to look like, and there's a lot of excitement and a lot of buzz. And it seems like

276
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:23,660
series are doing really good, you know, they've got Martha Stewart, they got NASCAR,

277
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,580
and I really, we do so much on serious, and it's such a freaking bummer that I can't hear it,

278
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,980
I can't hear the whole, you know, I can't just can't hear the stuff that we're doing, and that's a

279
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,220
pretty essential part of, even the source code, that listen to the source code after I record it,

280
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,060
I don't change anything, but I let it go out, but I just want to hear what it sounded like.

281
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,460
It may be a different impression, and I can prepare myself for the onslaught of email coming in

282
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:58,940
or responses or whatever. So I had a really, really good couple of hours met with the press people,

283
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:05,420
and they've got something pretty, pretty cool planned for the end of the month, and some things

284
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,860
are changing, and some things are going to be changing with the pod show on serious, and I think we're

285
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,820
going to get serious. So, that's just a tease in the coming weeks, I'll be telling you more about that,

286
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,940
but I'm very excited about what's going on over there, and have you seen that new device, by the way?

287
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,300
I think I brought the whole on a second, come with me for a moment. I think I brought it with me,

288
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:42,540
I got the new serious materials, the product guide for holiday 2005, and that includes all the

289
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,980
radios. This new thing they've got, that's pretty cool. It's the serious S50. Introduces the latest

290
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,220
in satellite radio entertainment combining live reception within the home car office with a

291
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:02,300
wearable player, and it is pretty small. One of those, you know, like those, you know, a laptop

292
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,940
that you're hanging on your belt, the XM-thus stuff, has up to 50 hours of content storage capability.

293
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,540
The attachable wearable player is small enough to use while you're working out traveling or just

294
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:20,060
hanging out. Now, here it is. So there's, here is, make your listening experience your own,

295
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,180
whether you want serious S50 to do it for you. You want to save your favorite

296
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,460
serious songs and shows, or you want to create your own playlists. Listen to three personalized

297
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,940
channels called my serious channels that are automatically created and continuously refresh

298
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,580
based upon your listening patterns. Save your favorite serious songs or shows with a single

299
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,420
press of the button, transfer favorite MP3s, and we know the media audio playlist from your computer.

300
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,580
So, you know, it seems to me like they've got something pretty interesting that there's some

301
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,700
technology that we could really just mess around with. No one has an actual device. We have lots of pictures

302
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,900
of it, but of course, I've said, get me one of those, damn it. I want to be in the United States until

303
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,460
the end of the month. So I think that there's some cool stuff ahead as it comes to that.

304
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:18,540
And of course, I celebrated my 41st birthday over the weekend on Saturday and I really realized

305
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,340
how much more as I get older, come on sit on my knee and let me tell you about this. I really

306
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,620
realized that you appreciated so much more when someone, you know, from the past particularly gives

307
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:38,380
you a call and says, hey, I was thinking of you happy birthday. That's really a gift all

308
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,140
by itself. It's just have someone thinking of you. And that's kind of what I, that was the epiphany

309
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,060
from my 41st birthday celebrated here in the United Kingdom. But I did get lots of stuff through email.

310
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,820
And one that I missed, but it was so, it's so beautiful. I want to play it for you even though it's

311
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:03,100
it's belated. Hello, Adam. It's me, Manj Weinstein, your favorite lesbian on the instruments.

312
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,940
And I heard you have a birthday coming up and you're going to be 41. Well, I'm 56 and you know what

313
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:19,100
that means. In 15 years, you get to eat my Fred join out. Well, meanwhile me and my queer

314
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:27,420
partners, your cute partners, some of the homosexuals podcasting, decided to get together and wish

315
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:34,220
you a happy birthday. So here it goes. A one and a two and a three.

316
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Oh, he's cute for an older man. I let him do me in the bus.

317
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,860
What a major multi-track extravagance. And I thought I heard it like a speaking spell in there as

318
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:26,140
well. So it was a twinkle boy, John Own, from the online podcast, Cheryl, Mercowski and Juan de Wisdom,

319
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,900
Patrick from the Patrick and Noah from the Patrick and Noah show, Marshall Click from Gabriel Hood

320
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:39,260
radio, podcast, Steak and of course, Madge. Everybody at qpotter.org. Thank you very much, boys and girls.

321
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:47,260
Much appreciated. Hey, I'm going to be in Chicago. Don't most of, well, Madge lives in Chicago,

322
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,580
Madge. I'm coming to Chicago. I'm going on a date with you, baby. Email from Bob Robinson.

323
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,300
Hey, Adam, talk about interesting. I just got a letter in the mail from arbitron. Those are the

324
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:04,060
folks who do the ratings in the US, the radio ratings. They want me to participate in their

325
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,860
radio and he has an quotes here, the radio station survey. I'm going to say yes, but I'm going

326
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,380
to log my podcast listening right alongside the traditional radio. Spiking it. Love it.

327
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,620
Fucking the man. And I already know, I listened to either podcast or streaming internet radio

328
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,860
much more often than over the air stations. I'll keep you posted. I bet they don't even have a podcast

329
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:32,220
section yet. I'll make sure that we get that that we get that changed. My period starts. My rating

330
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:40,060
period starts on 922 2005. Cool, Bob. Let us know if there's a little checkmark box there for podcast

331
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:47,900
or MP3s or anything like that. Remember, I did the sound advertising experiment where I asked

332
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,460
you listeners to pick a spot right now, wherever you're, excuse me. That's not since sale. That's

333
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:05,340
the palm in New York onion rings. Can you smell it? Pick a spot right now. It's a sign or it's a

334
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,100
house. It's somewhere where you drive by frequently. And then I put a word in your head like

335
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,980
sent sale. And then every single time you drive by it, you're going to think of sent sale.

336
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,420
So Kevin Crossman from Fremont, California wrote in says he had a normally I listened to the

337
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,260
dating source code in the karma way to work. So you had the right idea with your subliminal

338
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,500
experiment. Unfortunately, I listened to that particular show in bed before going to sleep.

339
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,980
So when you asked us to focus on an object, all I saw was darkness. The experiment was not a

340
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,780
complete failure, though. That night I had a dream. That night I had a dream. I was walking through

341
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,980
an airport. I sat down to wait for my flight and decided to strike up a conversation with the

342
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:55,500
traveler next to me. His name, Adam Curry. And Kevin is from the Frat Pack, by the way, play

343
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,340
that promo earlier for you here on the show. And on Monday, we rolled out the very first job

344
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,460
cast. Mark said it really liked it, but was surprised when the guys that would be Ron and Brian

345
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:13,260
and Michael Butler asked candidates to send in a paper CV. How about a CV cast with a candidate

346
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,460
at the CV as show notes? But then uses 10 to 15 minutes to tell the company about themselves.

347
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,380
That would be a great way to really shorten the recruitment cycle. The thing I got from the job

348
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,780
cast was that these guys sound like people I would like to work for. So I guess it might work in

349
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,420
reverse so that they hear someone they would want to have work for them. I'd say with them,

350
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,380
very good idea Mark, I like that. And I'm actually considering if someone does a CV cast,

351
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,420
if we should play it on the daily source code, although I'm a little worried because if it's

352
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:45,340
someone really good, then you know, he or she could get captured away from us. So maybe not.

353
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:52,940
And during the week, I played a like a six or seven minute piece from Ron's

354
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:01,900
group from the Zip 71101 podcast. He was interviewing evacuees. I want to read a little bit

355
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,580
of his email. He said he was listening to my show. And I was talking about the instant relief

356
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,460
that we expect in America about television and how we're being exposed to be all fixed up and

357
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,140
done in 26 minutes without commercials or if not Oprah will come and save the day. So then

358
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,900
you played a promo by Chris Rockwell in it. He said, quote, these people are not getting the

359
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,020
help they need to survive. I'm sorry, says Ron. That's not the case. What Chris is seeing on TV is

360
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,500
only a small amount of the people who are just now getting help. Why will because some have been

361
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,900
hiding in their homes not wanting to leave. They simply thought the water would go down quickly

362
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,820
or because they wanted to protect what little they have left. One person told me he had plenty of

363
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,220
food and water, but was afraid to leave because of the bad element. That was the shooting at the

364
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,700
record rescuers in evacuees. I know this, uh, Ron goes on to say because I've spoken with many of

365
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,780
the evacuees of the Red Cross shelter here in Shreveport, Louisiana. Yesterday he spent four hours

366
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,380
just talking to Red Cross volunteers. Um, and I hope he's going to put that on his podcast. The zip

367
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,220
1101 podcast. Now he also spoke again to the girl Tammy. That was the piece that I played on the

368
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,180
source code and she had no idea for dad and mom were safe because they stayed behind. So yesterday

369
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:16,140
as Ron was leaving he spotted her and she told him the Red Cross and founder father and he was

370
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:22,540
working with FEMA and they got him to a place to live in Lafayette, Louisiana for the family as

371
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,420
well and he was going to pick up her and her twin brother today. And the whole email that Ron posted

372
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:33,260
in here is definitely worth reading a hands-on eyewitness report. A real eyewitness report.

373
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:42,460
And it's excellent to see, um, you know, to see podcasting, uh, bringing out a different message

374
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,860
than we can then we can actually even technically get from television. I've said they can't zoom

375
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,140
out far enough to really show the scope of what's going on. Sometimes you need to use imagination and

376
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:00,460
theater of the mind and other reference points. Excuse me, Rob Kosslo, you know him is a big hit on the

377
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,740
podsafe music network at music.podshow.com. Um, of course, Rob Song I do, um, has gotten him a lot of

378
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,820
attention and he says that he just posts another song into the podsafe music network, a long one.

379
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,700
He says this one he wrote for his wife for their wedding. It's called Bliss and, uh, all the

380
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:24,140
info, of course, is on his page and I put a link to that in the show notes. And, uh, he's so he played

381
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,900
that, uh, almost that six years ago. So, uh, let's listen to a little bit of podsafe music here,

382
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,980
Rob Kosslo, which you can find at the podsafe music network. It's, uh, it is quite long,

383
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,540
but it's kind of soothing.

384
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:26,380
You know, it's, uh, it's a miracle they ever really got married.

385
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,540
If you played for that long with their wedding, I want to say though, um, I think that song would really

386
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:39,580
work well if you cranked it up really, really loud, uh, in the car and you don't like 110 miles

387
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,820
an hour just, you know, and then slowing down and then speeding up and then it gets that nice burst

388
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,220
at the end, uh, Rob Kosslo Bliss on your daily subscription.

389
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,220
I suppose you think you know where you're going. Yeah, I'm arrogant enough to say that.

390
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,980
Hey Adam, hope you're trip to New York when okay. Yeah, I'll be there soon as well.

391
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,020
Saturday, right? But I got a few things to do here. First, uh, such as a hit test, but I'm really looking

392
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:18,460
forward to going to the big Apple. So, um, I really can't wait. So, the hit test, three intervals,

393
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,620
and three answers. And this is number one.

394
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:32,620
Oh, it sounds like the first couple of notes of Bonnie Tyler, uh, told the clips of the

395
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,420
heart number two.

396
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,700
That's not enough. I know even when I listen back to this show, I'm not going to know it.

397
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,500
Number three.

398
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,780
All right, think we're going to make it Christopher Cross.

399
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,780
You who? Oh, man. I think I got two out of three today. And times up and these are the answers.

400
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,220
Ah, a slow start to hit test number 57. Bonnie Tyler, totally clips of the heart.

401
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,900
Every now and then, I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my teeth at a

402
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:28,540
wrong. Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone

403
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:35,740
by wrong. Every now and then, I get a little bit terrified of them. I see them looking

404
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,740
up.

405
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,180
Bonnie Tyler, totally clips of the heart, is answer number one.

406
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,980
And this is answer number two from 86.

407
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,380
Can't we Simon? It's currently Simon. This is coming around again.

408
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,140
Oh, man, it's got a new album out too.

409
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,980
I would not have guessed that one yet.

410
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:39,980
Oh, nothing stays the same. Bonnie, if you're willing to play the game, it's coming around again.

411
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:51,740
So don't mind if we're all apart. It's more than we've made a broken heart broken heart.

412
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,980
Coming around again is answer number two.

413
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,340
And third and final answer for today's hit test.

414
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,420
Also sung from 1983, it's rich stuff across and it's all right.

415
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,980
What a great song.

416
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,620
And so number three, it's very plus the few of Christopher Cross and it's all right. I think we're gonna make it.

417
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,980
Okay, and this concludes hit test number 57.

418
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,140
Don't know when the next one will be. It's very possible. It will be from the planes in New York.

419
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,540
It should be nice. Maybe I'll do some some sightseeing stuff in New York as well.

420
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:16,700
Don't really know yet, but we surprised if you see some weird things in the next hit test or hit test podcast.

421
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,380
Okay, you know what to do with feedback.

422
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,380
So send it to hittestidgmail.com

423
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,660
And of course the website yompolet.com.

424
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,980
J-A-N-P-O-L-T dot com.

425
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,300
Thank you for listening until number 58 so until then bye-bye.

426
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,340
Thank you very much, young.

427
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Cast plastered 38,000 feet cool. Can't wait to hear it.

428
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:46,940
Yompolet's hit test and if you hurt any of those songs when all mail.

429
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:53,100
Oh, I love that track. I don't know where the iTunes music store. I believe Yon is now putting the links into

430
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:59,340
yompolet.com so you can go over there and of course if you click on the links then

431
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:06,060
Yon will get a little bit of renumeration for his tireless tireless work that he doesn't hit test.

432
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,460
What was that episode number 57 already? Well let me just check.

433
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:18,380
Was it 57? Wow, yeah, unbelievable. Okay, so tomorrow the girls leave tomorrow evening and

434
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,140
it's you know it's gonna be a month we really don't see each other all that motion.

435
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,100
Miss him. Damn. Such as life.

436
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,980
That's it for your baby source code for today. September 8, 2005.

anything you want that you think

443
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,940
We should pay some attention to

444
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,980
Don't forget the pod sake music network at music.potshow.com. It's really rocking

445
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,980
Got a lot of cool students coming in every single day. I think we're gonna do a

446
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
a new music show and

447
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,900
pretty soon also a top 10 the top 10 pod plays

448
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm now 10 minutes after five in the afternoon. I've got a couple of pod show calls coming up in

449
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,100
I don't know how or so of course the west coast is waking up. So I will be back here tomorrow

450
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:42,140
and maybe I'll get the Patricia Christina on on the show. Christina of course is now back at school.

451
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,740
