1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, yes, the daily source code for March 29th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yo, DJ!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Are you done, Netflix?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We don't need not sticking grids in.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm just kidding.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's Adam Curry.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hey everybody.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome to the daily source code from Southfield.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm going to go away.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's stand there looking at me, naked.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The daily source code coming to you from the balcony of our wonderful

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Rent and condo here in South Beach.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Close to Miami Beach, Florida.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh man, this is definitely going to be a vacation cast.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You don't mind.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Probably underprepared, but how many comments do I have to read?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And how many emails do I have to receive it?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I just got to do some kind of something, right?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Got to get some kind of podcast out there.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, shoot.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I just just turned off all the lights.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm out on the balcony.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is one of those, you know, kind of like the Miami Rice condos that you see,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the high rise is run the 19th floor right now and have that peasant out here.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Time now is 5 a.m. UK time, which makes it 11 p.m. here in Miami.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And we just got back from dinner, which is always much,

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
vacation time is always later by, by definition, but it seems like light here in general

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is just much later.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And I'm on messed up.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're all jet lagging, crazy.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So I really just wanted to talk about a couple things about our stay so far as you can tell.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm pretty out of it.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's wow.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We had a long plane ride, Sunday.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We left.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We left the cottage.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And we're able to get a direct flight to Miami on British airways.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The flight was pretty much unabentful.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was nice, you know, it was, yeah, it was just, you know, a typical 10 hour flight,

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
which, oh man, it's like, you think you're going to New York and then a little bit,

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but you really are going like 10 hours.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's with the headwinds.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
On the way back, it would be a little bit shorter, about eight and a half hours.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We just make sure I've got enough volume here.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm basically just, we just got back from dinner and I said, you know what?

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I just got to do a little, oh, okay, I see what's going on.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I have my volume turned down on the, I'm back to old school now.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of course, I didn't bring my 19 inch rack.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't have no valve or tube processors.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I think like that, it's just me the laptop and the microphone.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You hear that?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So this is, I mean, the view is, I'm going to take a picture.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I tried to buy a camera the other day.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The one I wanted, they didn't have in stock.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I decided just to wait until I can get that one.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But 19 floor, overlooking part of the marina.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And let's see, you've got a straight shot of the downtown Miami.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And of course, on the other side, you can see the beach.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It is just absolutely phenomenal.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You've got these, the balcony itself, I think of this.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is a two bedroom condo that we're renting for, for 10 days.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The balcony is probably like 800 square feet.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's just unbelievable.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And the first, we were here Sunday.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So we got in Sunday, Sunday night.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You know, we went to bed like, I don't know, 10 o'clock or something like that.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We got in late five or six p.m.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it was like the Wizard of Oz, man, all of a sudden.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's just, there was so much wind.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And we knew it was going to be a windy day Sunday and Monday.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And it was just like, you know, plans were flying by and pillows were flying by.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Excuse me.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A little bit dusty up here.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So even though it's vacation, just a quick update.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And actually, it hasn't been 100% vacation.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ron is in the same building.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, that's what you're just turning the lights on again.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He lives in this building.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's how we were able to get a hold of this condo that we could rent for the time while we're here.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So of course, we've been doing a little bit of just a teensy little bit of work.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, we've closed, I think, six contracts in the past two weeks.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So we've really, really been working in very hard.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's kind of convenient, but I am officially on vacation.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Haven't even checked out the pool yet.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I've been going through infrastructure stuff.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Had to get a wireless, you know, a little d-link for the,

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
because there was, there was internet here in the, in the apartment.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But it basically, you know, a cable motor with a Ethernet wire coming out of it.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I went to the Apple store at the Aventura Mall.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think giving shit away now at the Apple store unbelievable.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There must have been 20 to 25 people in line to pay continuously.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And all I really wanted was an airport express.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You know, one of those Wi-Fi deals that you just, you know,

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's a self-contained unit kind of looks like the power adapter that comes with the,

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
with the power booking is plug it in.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And you've got your Wi-Fi and you can also stream your iTunes over it.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not going to make sure what it costs, actually.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's got to be over $100, actually.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let me take a look at, see, now I'm on the balcony.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I got my Wi-Fi, which of course is not going to be an Apple Wi-Fi,

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
but you kind of guessed that already.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh yeah, no, now that I'm recording on the,

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
now that I'm recording on the power book,

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
it's kind of hard to use firefox.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Come on, now forget about it.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So it's definitely more than the 49 box I paid for this little mini d-link.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Which is the 56 megabit per second version, the 802.11G.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And it's small, it's got, that's probably got a better range,

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and you know, little antenna on it.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So it's perfectly happy with that.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Still looking for the perfect windows machine to buy,

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to tote around both as my Skype phone and my podcasting recording set up.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Haven't found that yet.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And we just been, you know, trying to chill a little bit.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's been getting used to the time difference.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You know, I've been traveling a little bit more recently,

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
so for me is, I don't know where my ass is.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm completely, completely confused when it comes to all time zones.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, there's a night flight coming in from somewhere.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Flying almost overhead the marina.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So the girls are just a little bit jet lag,

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but they're getting better.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
As I said, this is just going to be a short little update podcast,

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
just to let you know that I'm still alive.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, and by the way, something that was troubling me for a couple of days

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
was what really happened to Billy Ocean.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't remember where we played.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The numberally hurts without you.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And a whole bunch of people sent me basically the same story

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that Tom sent me.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And of course, I put this on the show notes on curry.com.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But after his 1994 smash at Caribbean Queen,

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and over the next five years,

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Billy Ocean topped US and international charts with suddenly lover boy.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They'll be sad songs when the going gets tough,

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
get out of my dreams.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, Billy Ocean, after that sadly, apparently fell into drugs,

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
went to prison and obscurity in the 1990s.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But after recovery and spiritual renewal,

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Billy returned to his native Trinidad in 2002

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
as earned notable respect,

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and adulation from schools of fine and performing arts.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's now a grain, bearded, dreadlocked elder in his 50s.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He enjoys gardening, playing pan,

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and occasionally touring Europe.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
At least he's alive, man.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There's so many people who didn't make it through all of that.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's pretty tough to hear about Billy.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's take a little quick walk up and down the balcony here.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hold on, let me take off the headphones.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I'm now kind of like at the corner, which means,

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I guess this is the, what is that?

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That would be the eastern corner, I think?

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No, that would be east.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So the northern corner, that's it, right?

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Looking over the marina.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Maybe you can hear the traffic down below on the causeway.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is actually the wind's picked up a little bit.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You probably hear some of that rustling through.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So I'm walking back again.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Nice corner shroud here.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is dining room table.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All kind of normal stuff.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know, it's crazy though.

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So this place is basically glass, right?

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's glass on two sides, big sliding doors.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And the three of us, Christina Patricia and myself,

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
have at least once, but I've actually done a twice.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I've walked into the glass, even though the doors have been slid open,

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
so you can walk through.

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I just, I don't know what it is.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know, it's like, probably just mindlessness.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Just kind of walking around.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, I'm going to walk outside and bunk.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I bumped into it, Christina bumped into it.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Patricia was the best.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She had a sandwich.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She bumped into into the glass sliding door,

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and there's like sandwich all over the door.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, my goodness.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let me get the headphones back on here.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So, let me see.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What have we gotten?

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like, a 10 minutes is almost nothing.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
A couple of things, just a little bit of business.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I got a take care of here.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A couple of promos that I promised I'd play,

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
otherwise I'd get into trouble.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So check these off.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey, Adam, how's it going?

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's reges here and I got a little trivia question for you.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you get when you take a guy like me

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
who could his job in the public schools to be self-employed?

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean, I don't work, but I'm not unemployed.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
A dad who's a domestic engineer by day,

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
karaoke DJ by night.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean, I make money, but I don't work.

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And finally, a guy that's unlucky in love and careers,

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
did you know that you can file for an appointment on line now?

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Mix them all together, and what do you got?

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Not sure.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, here's a little audio clue for you.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's put them on me to have a career.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hello, a career.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And there's your answer.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A show called The Unemployment Line.

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
For you guys podcasting at a Tuesday morning because

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
we have no jobs.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Find us on the web at unemploymentcho.com.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And now, back to you, Adam, in the studio.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
In the studio, out on the balcony here in the lovely South Beach, Florida.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
On the vacation, I've been looking forward to this for a while.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We really needed some sun and sunshine.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We will get it.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's been 80 degrees.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Except for the first.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Excuse me, the first day, as I said, Monday, Sunday through Monday was just

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
a little windy.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And it's just going to be great tomorrow again.

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know what we're going to do.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're just going to chill out.

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We know we're going to vote over here.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
One thing that I do know for 100% for sure is in this week,

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Ron and I are going to do a podcast together.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm going to interview him.

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's find out what he's been working on.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And you guys know what?

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I've been working on.

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's find out what he's been working on.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Maybe we can make some damage announcements already, you know?

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hello, Adam, just a brief promo to invite you and all your listeners to

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
check out the latest edition of digital flats.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is our show number 11, the one pound edition.

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And it promises to be the most explosive edition ever.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We can be found at the directory at ipodder.org.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Come give us a listen.

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Thanks a lot, Adam.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Peace out.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
PW Fender.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'd like to tell you, it's one of my favorite podcasts, digital

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
flats.

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I look forward to it.

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Every single weekend when it comes out.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's usually out Friday or Saturday, depending on when my ipodder

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
picks it up.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It is.

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's always a theme based show and just some great music.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
PW's got a great voice.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I just, you know, the themes are good.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I really, really, really enjoy it.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I know that the one pound edition is a great story.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So make sure you check that out.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You know, I'm going to save all the stuff that I had for tomorrow.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I got a mash up with the, so you got a Kylie Britney mash up.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I got a Joan Jett Queen mash up.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Got a couple of pod save tunes.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I might even just run to iTunes and buy something because of the weather is just so inspiring.

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So I'm going to cut it reasonably short for tonight.

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And we'll be back tomorrow.

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Sometimes in the afternoon with a longer edition.

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So I'll post this as I guess Tuesday's show.

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If I could still get it compressed and get it up to the server on time.

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And tomorrow I'll be back with more.

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll be a little more coherent.

270
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Still just a little bit jet lag, but one let you know.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm alive.

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We're having a good time.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Stuff is moving ahead.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's all happening in South Beach, baby.

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
On the balcony.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
All right.

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Should have any questions about this.

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Rather under-performing show, short as it is.

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Atamercurry.com or through the problem at www.curry.com.

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
DailySourceco.com for the pod show, pod cast feed, and for the latest, and the archive.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So how are all the people in charge?

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm off to bed, man.

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I've had it.

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll see you all tomorrow.

286
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll take care.

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll take care.

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll take care.

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll take care.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll take care.

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll take care.

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll take care.

293
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll take care.

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'll take care.

295
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll take care.

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll take care.

297
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll take care.

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll take care.

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll take care.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll take care.

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll take care.
