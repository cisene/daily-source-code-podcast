1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, testing one, two, one, two, check one, two, three, hey everybody hold on, I don't think

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
it's just right yet.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let me crank that up a bit.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is that working?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is the daily source code.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's Wednesday.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's the ninth of March, sorry, April.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
March, 2005.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm trying out something entirely new, which is so beautiful and elegant.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That if it actually does work, it'll just be a breakthrough in sensing, podcasting, and mobile

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
podcasting, you can tell I'm missing around with my microphone right now.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Shoot.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is not going the way I planned it.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hold on.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Put the mic there.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a little hard to tell if the mic quality is up to speed.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hold on a sec.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm now outputting as much as possible from my wireless setup.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What I've done upon the recommendation from a couple people, as I was on a continuing

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
quest to find the perfect mobile mixer, said, why don't you use one of those splitters

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that people use for headphones?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hopefully, so one headphone out jack turns into two headphone out jacks, both stereo,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and reverse the process and use that for your input.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Combining the input from my microphone, I won't say.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And the input from a portable player, such as an iPod, and combining those two through

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that splitter, and then, you know, just basically it's a one-to-one mixer, and you control

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the volume of the audio on the...

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Whoa.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I just turned the iPod on.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think that really...

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, that's probably the answer to the question, will this work?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wow.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That was pretty weird.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let me see if I disconnect the iPod.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Whoops.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wow.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hold on.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's...wait.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wait a minute.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's not...Oh, of course not.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not doing it right.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not doing it.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Am I doing it right?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Holy moly.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm so confused.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hold on a second.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll put your impulse while I try and think this through for a second.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think you're on pause, by the way.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think I figured it out.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I have the splitter going into the microphone jack.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The one part, so I'm using the...

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What normally would be the out as the...

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Is the in part?

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Man, that sounds so confusing.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And now I'm going to connect...

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Bitch is going to do the same thing.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is probably why you need a mixer,

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it's because when you...

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just connect basically the two wires together.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You get that shoot.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's not really going to work.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
At least I don't think.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Unless...

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Unless I really...

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can I crank up the volume anymore on the microphone set?

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I doubt that, too.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hello, hello, hello.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So that's like maximum.

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But that could even be overmodulating at this point.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I cannot...

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Literally cannot hear myself to the headphones.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So let me just...

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
See...

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll just play something sort of...

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have something really...

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Short here, don't I?

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've sounded of the day.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's play the see what happens.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I can volume down and talk over the music.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then...

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then I can...

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Put it up.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The sound of the day is...

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The sound of the day is...

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The singing of the music.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, there we go.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Watching machine.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All right.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So the question is...

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's the level of the microphone?

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Like, it doesn't sound like it's going to be very good.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So I have to say this test is...

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Not good.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Not to...

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Successful.

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, let's say the test was successful.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just the outcome is not what we wanted.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going to listen back to this and then we'll start the show.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's kind of working.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey, everybody.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's kind of working.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey.

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's Adam Curry coming to you from the Curry Cottage here in Guilford.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And the lovely...

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Was it...

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Suburb of Surrey and the United Kingdom.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
All mobile today.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The power of the Lord is coming.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm trying out the set up.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You just heard me basically set up.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's kind of interesting because I control the volume of the background or the tune in this case.

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just by twirling my thumb on the iPod wheel.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But I used a headphone connecting wire for the microphone.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which means there's a little volume control right on the wire.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I can start to turn that down.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because that's one thing when you're playing a mashup.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You want to be able to mute your microphone.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So that's now possible.

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And it's kind of working.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So we'll give it a shot.

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But essentially, I'm doing something that should not be done by any...

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Electro-technical...

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You know, means or terms.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because this is exactly why I need a mixer.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You don't have these basically these two outputs just connected to each other.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's all kinds of crap that's going on.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sure you can probably blow something up doing this as well.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That wouldn't surprise me at all.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But all in the name of science, my friends, all in the name of science.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know, I didn't...

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, man, I didn't even grab my show notes.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Normally I have that all set up because I record direct onto my power book.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So here we go.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wow, this is kind of cool.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, is it already starting to sound crappy now?

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is that?

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, we'll just go through the whole show and then see where we wind up.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How about a mash-up?

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Ooh, how about the D.J. skills?

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This can skip me to the next track on the iPod.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is a mash-up.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is the saled-y-said.

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the Bradmix on the source code.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When it's too late, it's me.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Who buys money?

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When you pay the rent?

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Think you think that money was heaven's end?

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Friday night, the rise without a surrogate?

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sunday morning, freebing like a nom nom nom.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
On these dollars, learn to tie his food base.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
T.E.R.B.R.B.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Lady Madonna, baby at your rest.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
One does how your man is to feed the way.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

183

The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, that's kind of disturbing and really cool at the same time.

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Beatles vs. Paul McCartney.

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Say Lady say the Vietnamese just one of the many nice workshops I got received.

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Well, over the past couple of weeks, it seems to just really pick up a lot.

252
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,360
A couple of things I want to talk with you about today, let's see.

253
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,800
One of them I received an email from, we'll just call this person, DJ Ultra Violet,

254
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
and I hope this is sounding okay.

255
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,200
I can hear kinds of crackling and shit.

256
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,800
And she's a lawyer.

257
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,960
And basically, she said, hey, if you have any questions about this music licensing stuff,

258
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,640
why don't you let me know, and then I said, well, very simply, is there a way for me to pay

259
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,880
to play R-I-A-A licensed music on a podcast, and how much is it?

260
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,160
That was the only question.

261
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,880
And I think one of the problems is, shit, I'm sorry, that's the crackling.

262
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
There we go.

263
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,400
And that's literally all I wanted to know.

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,560
And she actually came back with some very interesting thoughts and ideas,

265
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,960
which I can't publish in the show notes, because she checked it with her law firm.

266
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,400
And obviously there's no one need the aggravation of having to check all this stuff.

267
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,400
If she could say that, or if I could podcast it, but sound exchange, sound exchange.com

268
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,840
is the royalty collection agency for digital music webcasting.

269
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,560
And so the question now, of course, does podcasting belong in the webcasting category?

270
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,280
I don't think so.

271
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,000
It seems like just about everything would fit within their license.

272
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,640
But let me see, I'm reading here, yeah, because podcasts are basically archived,

273
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,880
and not, you know, streamed that could be a problem.

274
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,480
And it's also, it will be $500 a year.

275
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,720
Oh, oh, that was interesting.

276
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,960
Crap, of course.

277
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,120
So the iPod switched off.

278
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,520
And then it automatically gave control back to the microphone.

279
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
This may not be a very handy way of doing this.

280
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm going to have to pay attention to how this is going now.

281
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,240
Okay.

282
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,680
So sound exchange.com, you know, I'm going to be reading through it and see if there's anything,

283
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,880
that might actually work, and who knows, maybe someone over there is listening,

284
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,920
and they can help us out.

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,680
Email from bicyclemark.

286
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,080
Oh, yeah, he was doing something interesting.

287
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,040
I wanted to tell you about.

288
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,400
And just go to Google and search for a bicycle mark, the bicycle mark communique,

289
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,640
or, of course, you can go into the iPod directory at iPod about org.

290
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,320
And you can pick up there under sound seeing tours or sound seeing tours.com.

291
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,800
You can find bicycle mark almost anywhere you want.

292
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,840
But he's done a reverse sound seeing tour, as it were.

293
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,160
Remember, he did that cool thing with the flicker photos,

294
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,960
which is not really catching on, where he plays a little tone.

295
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,080
And then you click through the flicker slide show.

296
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,320
So now he's actually doing it like Uncle Stan's slide show.

297
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
You know, when he comes over and boars the whole family,

298
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,360
only it's not that boring.

299
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,080
And he's doing the audio commentary after he photographed the slide show.

300
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
God, this sounds horrible.

301
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,240
Oh my god, you know, I'm just going to check this and see how this sounds.

302
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
This is, this is starting to become worrisome.

303
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,040
Yeah. So, you know, kind of as I thought it doesn't sound too hot,

304
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,720
but I'll just leave it for now and we'll just use it as an experiment.

305
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,720
So, hey, all I really need is just a mixture between those two inputs.

306
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,880
One little mixture, and with, you know, with a way to pot down the microphone,

307
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,440
which I think I've already found. I mean, that they were almost there.

308
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay, so that was bicycle mark.

309
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,280
I had to, what is this? The next track I wanted to play,

310
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,200
mouse pad report. I think I know if that was a promo or not.

311
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,640
It's, uh, I compiled this, uh, the day before yesterday, so I'm a little fuzzy on exactly what we're

312
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,480
going to do. Let's check it out. Adam Curry, the pod father, our father in pod.

313
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,560
Oh, yeah. King Curry, give my love to the queen, Dawn.

314
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,680
I got to save the queen. This is a promo with no production value.

315
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,840
Uh-huh. Who why what else do we need? Me, you, the mic, we got everything.

316
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,280
This is a three-ring pod cast. WWEW.3ringpodcast.com.

317
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,920
It's about life, the universe, and everything.

318
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,520
No more pod cast about nothing. Who wants to listen to that?

319
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,720
We're about everything. So, come on. Show some love for the new boys on the block.

320
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,360
We were down with the mashups and the hit test. It's all good. But come on.

321
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,400
There's new boys on the block. We're not getting any. We're not getting any love.

322
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,840
Lightly from you. Spreading love. It's a more promo. It's all right.

323
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,080
I discovered some of my favorite pod castes through your show. So, let's go.

324
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,840
One or two a day. Won't kill you. Never one will love it. So, come on. Jump on my train.

325
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,320
We're having a good time at the three-ringpodcast. Check us out. Thanks.

326
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,920
Late. Oh, is that it now? That's the new thing. Late. All right, bro. Late. Cool. Uh, absolutely.

327
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,360
So, um, the mixer that I would love to have is, you know, it runs on like a, um,

328
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,760
it runs on like one battery, right? And it just mixes these two input signals. And that's really all it

329
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,960
has to do. Um, and it, but it has to, you know, I'm sure radio shacket has something like this.

330
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,680
I just got to go visit one. I get to find them. My nearest radio shack. You know that in America,

331
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,240
I think it's every American, almost every American lives within 15 minutes of a radio shack.

332
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,120
Yeah, we pitched their business once. Didn't get it, but it was fun pitching. Learning about radio

333
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,000
shack. I was like, I kind of grew up in radio shack. So, obviously, you know, it's kind of silly.

334
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm sitting here with a, uh, you know, 350 dollar iPod. I've got a, uh, it was a $250 dollar, uh,

335
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,400
I river. I've got my wireless set, which is not necessary, of course. But that's, you know,

336
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,600
the only, uh, love microphone I have. I can kind of walk around with. So, it's an expensive solution,

337
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,760
but still even those two devices. I mean, it could easily be combined in the one, just put the

338
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,600
input on the box. And, um, and kind of, uh, yeah, this playlist, uh, what ideas I just, uh,

339
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,640
compiled a little playlist on iTunes of the stuff I wanted to play in today's show. And, uh,

340
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,680
and, you know, I scroll to that in the iPod, and there you go. It's, uh, uh, it's basically,

341
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,560
I'm trying to keep it from popping off. So, they're setting for that, actually, let me see.

342
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,880
So, they're setting, oh, man, iPod is not great. Let me see, shuffle repeat.

343
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:35,560
Does it have a timeout? Has the backlight timer, but that's, hmm, interesting. So, I guess you

344
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:44,600
can't set that. All right. I go back to today's playlist. Ah. Um, now I had something written down

345
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,400
about podcast alley. I know that podcast alley has changed its voting system. Um, to, what is it?

346
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,600
And I think you can vote once a month. That's interesting. I'm talking with the Chris from podcast

347
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,600
alley. It's a very interesting guy. He's got some fun stuff going on over there. But I think that

348
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,240
we can do, um, there is a real ratings component to, uh, podcast, and that I haven't really looked

349
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,920
at that much, but I hear, uh, lots of people talking about it. And obviously, I think what we're looking

350
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:21,720
at is, um, because the mainstream media really loves, um, you know, easy, easy ways to show

351
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,360
their readership or their viewership or listenership, um, you know, what is going on in a certain

352
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,000
community. It's really easy to, to pick something and say, oh, well, here's the top 10 of anything.

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,400
And so, and, and that's actually not that bad. Um, but, you know, the, the gripes are that, you know,

354
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,040
it's the top 10 of why. There's kind of like having a top 10 of web logs. So maybe if we define

355
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,240
it a little bit better, and we made, uh, I, I think we can do something with this voting. I guess that's

356
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,280
what I'm saying. Um, and we should be able to convert that energy into something really good for

357
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,800
everybody. So I've been thinking about that thinking about it a lot. Um, and, uh, who knows what

358
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,840
else, uh, you may be you're out there thinking about some things as well, um, because it's just

359
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,160
amazing to see this happen. It's really cool. Um, to have all this fury flying and then you're

360
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,480
here, uh, Don and Drew talking about, oh, no, we were not, we're not going to talk about it anymore.

361
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:23,960
And, uh, and Madge Weinstein over East Radio, um, you know, has, has her take on it as well. It's just,

362
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,520
it's, uh, it's been interesting. And this new podcast that I found, and I, at first I thought I was

363
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,640
going to be repurposed content kind of like the Pepsi Max, um, what they call that Pepsi Max is doing

364
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,600
a promotion. It's a, I think they do it on UK radio stations. And they're basically just repurposing

365
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,400
that in a podcast, which is, it's cool, um, although the, ah, shit, did it again. Although the, um,

366
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,400
uh, what is it? The humor is, it's very British humor. So, you know, it's a, a wind up, that's what

367
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,680
they call it, a wind up is where, you know, basically the prank phone calling people. Um, but this

368
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,920
podcast is something that, uh, I think it can actually get into. And once I get my life a little bit,

369
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,960
you know, more structured, uh, just been a lot going on as you heard yesterday. I'm still traveling a

370
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,200
lot and, uh, and tying up loose ends all over the globe. Um, I'd like to, you know, get back into

371
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,240
the habit of, uh, walking or, you know, more regular exercise, uh, I've threatened Patricia that

372
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,520
we're actually going to, uh, uh, you know, go to the gym one of these days and get that started as well.

373
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:35,160
And we will, uh, but this podcast is from Marina and actually, uh, it's, uh, it's what you want,

374
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,600
you know, you want a daily fresh mix of exercise music with someone, very motivated about helping

375
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,840
you exercise. Here's the first of the podcast by Marina. This is Marina and you're listening to my

376
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,680
high energy fitness, sing off the pound. If you work out all the time or you never worked out before,

377
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,680
we're going to have a great time today, burn lots of calories. Whoo! You see, it doesn't matter what

378
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,240
kind of workout you're into, walking, running, spinning, aerobic fans, as long as you never stop

379
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,240
moving. So come on, let's have better times. Yeah, okay. Let's work out. Let's have better times together.

380
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,800
And then I thought it was like, oh, this is just one of those exercise tapes, but then somewhere

381
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,480
I heard the word podcast pop up, probably around here somewhere because, I don't think I could

382
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:37,240
listen to this music for a very long. But, uh, is that her singing? No. And mine feet. That's interesting.

383
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,160
It's a 10-minute, you know. So it's the perfect, uh, perfect length, too. It's not one of those,

384
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,680
you know, really long ones that you're going to pause midway anyway. We see if I can pass forward.

385
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,800
I knew there was something about podcast. I knew it's that.

386
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,960
All right, wait, it must have been that piece, hold on.

387
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,920
You're doing a great job. Thanks for being with me today. On the part.

388
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:16,760
There it is, you see? Yeah, that's cool. All right, let's go everybody.

389
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,880
Okay. Oh, baby, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

390
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:51,320
Okay, all right. All right, all right, it may be way too early for you for this

391
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,160
crap. So I'll turn this down. You know, I'll keep it on in the background so I can use that as my

392
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,760
don't turn off the iPod mechanism while we talk a little bit more.

393
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:06,280
Well, I discovered something interesting. The gaming guys out there, I got an email from, uh,

394
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,760
was it Aaron? And, uh, we starts off as email, which I will put in the show notes, you know,

395
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,880
by saying that he received started playing Grand Theft Auto, Vice City, uh, as Xbox after,

396
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,840
you know, finishing it months ago. It turns out that there's a lot of stuff going on with Xbox

397
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,440
and Xbox Live, and basically the gaming developers who I think use the dot net infrastructure,

398
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:38,520
or, or, or, I'm sorry, direct X, God, I know nothing about Windows. But they are, uh, creating

399
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,240
some really cool audio tools. Uh, in fact, you can, uh, you can listen to different radio stations now

400
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,280
while you're driving the car in the game. And they're also this Xbox Live stuff is, you know,

401
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,040
it's, I've been looking into it. I'm not a gamer at all. We have an Xbox, uh, Christina has an

402
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Xbox. I don't even think we unpacked it, you know, we're just not really gamers. And, uh, but I was

403
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,560
interested because this stuff obviously runs in, uh, in Windows, and there may be some really

404
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,720
good slick tools that can be made from the gaming community. So I'm pretty excited about that,

405
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:19,400
and I reached out to Larry, remember we played Larry's promo, he's from Microsoft. He's from the

406
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,640
Xbox division. So, no, we'll see if we can get any traction with that. I just thought it was kind

407
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,360
of interesting that all this activity is going on. And, and there's some, uh, gamers now Xbox,

408
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,960
I don't know if their developers are just gamers or both, but they are also doing podcasts,

409
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,080
you know, about gaming. So there's something going on. I'm definitely going to try and figure

410
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,120
out where the community is and, uh, and, you know, introduce myself and see if we can connect

411
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,160
something here, because I think there is something going on for sure. And now, cue the next track.

412
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Oops. Oh, that's just from my buddy, P.W. Fenton.

413
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:18,760
Oh, Adam, and welcome to the geriatric hit test. We have a doozy for you today. So what do you say?

414
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:28,280
We get started. We get out three great songs for you to identify. So what do you say?

415
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:35,640
We get started. Rock and roll. Oh, you said that already. Oh, I did it. Okay, then get

416
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:50,120
ready, Adam. Here comes number one. Oh, what was that? It's a neat little drop.

417
00:24:50,760 --> 00:25:06,200
Okay, what a wonderful song. Yeah. Okay, let's begin with number one.

418
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,840
Grandpa, he did that one already. Look, we're 21. We have two. Oh, we're two.

419
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:29,960
Okay, then here comes number three. Oh, number three. Nice bumper.

420
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:37,080
White Christmas? No.

421
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,600
Now, here comes the answers. Okay, we missed number two. Number one was the Pentalvania

422
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,920
Polka by Miron Florian in his accordion. Oh, okay.

423
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,040
And the Pental. Okay, I should have known that actually. Patricia would have known that one.

424
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Number two was when the we do number two. No, you didn't. No, grandpa. You skipped number two.

425
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,080
Well, he answered a number two would have been when the moon comes over the mountain by Kate Smith.

426
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:34,280
Oh, sorry, I didn't play. In finding number three.

427
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,480
Freak grandpa. Uh, it's getting me. Number three. Number three.

428
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:54,520
Oh, wait, I could find it. Wait, number. Number three was tenderly by Rosemary Clooney.

429
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,160
Another one Patricia would have known. I'm sure.

430
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,120
They've never seen it before.

431
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Oh, yeah.

432
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,840
Let's ramble in trees and brace the brain.

433
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,880
Okay, well, that's today's hit test. Where's Nan? Lunchtime yet.

434
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,840
We already had lunch, grandpa. Go tell Nan. It's lunch time and we're ready for lunch.

435
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,800
I think yeah, that is from my buddy Peter. It's great creativity, my man. Thank you very, very much.

436
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,800
Oh, boy. Um, let's see. What else we're going to talk about? Have a couple of things written down here.

437
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,360
Um, a lot of, um, these are really, I prepared, as I said, prepared this the day before yesterday.

438
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,960
And I'm not quite sure what I was thinking at the time. But I wrote down to talk about the death of

439
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,240
radio. And there is a discussion as a conversation going on now about radio. And I think the

440
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,600
wired article really picked up on that or wired magazine, you know, looked at different angles.

441
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,520
Uh, I think that even the cover says the death of radio as we know it and they looked at

442
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:26,600
different types of broadcasting and distribution methods really that are taking some hold.

443
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,120
But more importantly, and I think that that's really where the conversation should be going is not

444
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:39,480
necessarily about the distribution. But, um, I think that we have a whole generation of people growing

445
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,240
up and we've talked about this before who really just, you know, are not interested in what radio

446
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:52,920
has to offer. Um, and, and the, uh, I don't know if you remember the, um, the podcast I did

447
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,840
with Christina when I took her to school and I said, you know, what, what radio station do you do?

448
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,480
Listen, the radio, I think I said. And she said, yeah, listen to, uh, the eagle. And in the same

449
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,920
breath, she said, because you can go up there to the studio and hold up her request in front of the

450
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,640
window. And I'm like, yeah, that is exactly what this whole new generation that grew up with messenger

451
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:23,320
and, uh, and, you know, so MSN and hotmail or Xbox, you know, that's exactly what they're used to,

452
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,680
you know, it is feedback, direct immediate feedback where something happens, you know, a way to

453
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,520
be a part of the process, to be a part of, um, of the creation of the output of the product. And that is,

454
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:42,120
I think a big part of what weblogs, uh, are about, uh, or met many whoop, holy crap. This is just not a

455
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:49,400
good way to do it. Um, uh, wait, can I put on? Let's, uh, let's find a track.

456
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,040
Wow, this really screws it all up, doesn't it? Oh, man, why do I shouldn't have done this way?

457
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,800
Hold on. Well, now I'm committed. We find something from the 70s music been, uh,

458
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:12,120
oh, man. Okay, we'll just put this in the background. Really, quietly. Okay.

459
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,000
Right. So I was talking about, uh, yeah, that Christina really liked being able to be a part

460
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,000
of the process of what is happening on that radio station. And of course, the fact that her friends are

461
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,560
listening to it because it's local. And that's when radio really does work best. And I think that's what

462
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,560
radio has proven throughout its history to do incredibly well. Um, is within a local community. And,

463
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,960
you know, that is a little bit more than the local temperature and the local traffic conditions.

464
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,920
Granted, those are probably, you know, 70% of the information people need from their local

465
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,120
radio stations. But, you know, there's a lot. And whenever you hear that, you know, uh, the community,

466
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,400
bullet board or whatever, uh, whatever the, that particular segment may be called, which is basically

467
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,200
run as a PSA public service announcement. That's important. That's an important part of, um,

468
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,000
of what radio broadcasting is about. And it's also a part of the license of these stations and

469
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,040
obligation, uh, to work for the community. And that's for a reason. And I think part of that

470
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,360
reason is because that's what radio really does extremely well. And then you're using, you know,

471
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:25,720
the public airwaves to their maximum benefit. Wow. Um, so if podcasting is, uh, going to follow

472
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:33,400
that model or any type of, um, uh, communication audio communication, maybe I should call it,

473
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,640
that is mobile. Because that's real important, right? It's very important that this stuff is mobile.

474
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,480
Because that, that's what, you know, part of the big revelation of radio was, is that, you know,

475
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,040
this could be, um, enjoyed anywhere. Notice it didn't say receives, but it could be enjoyed anywhere.

476
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,560
So, um, podcasting, whether it's, uh, I guess any type of content really, but let's just, you know,

477
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,960
look at audio because that seems to be happening will work really well in smaller communities.

478
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,880
The, uh, the thing that that we're then going to bump up against is, well, you know, it takes

479
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:13,160
a time to do this. And, uh, some people not all, certainly not all, probably only a few,

480
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:21,800
really on a grand scale, will want to make money, um, by doing this. And to me, it's, it's all

481
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,160
down to the content, you know, uh, you can be just as funny as John Stewart, and you're going to have

482
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,320
just as much opportunity, uh, to be as successful. Um, you know, it's take away the TV show part,

483
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,200
but, you know what I'm saying? Uh, because those barriers are coming down and it's, and it's only

484
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,440
going to come down to who can move fast, who can be the best. It's going to be quality, uh,

485
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,800
over anything else, which is going to make the playing field incredibly level and very,

486
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,400
very interesting. We'll be able to see the battle much better when there are no hills on the

487
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,280
battle field. And I'm looking forward to a lot of that. Uh, so in the background, you've been

488
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,960
listening to Food Rotten, fell in love, uh, Elven Bishop with, um, it was a Mickey Hart who, uh,

489
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,400
who's saying on that particular track. Uh, and now I'm going to move over to a bit of cadence,

490
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,200
which we haven't heard in a while, and I thought I'd play one for you. Uh, the Leland Standford,

491
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,840
Jr. University, marching band. Here's the incomparables.

492
00:34:46,840 --> 00:35:06,200
Yeah. More than just a cadence, actually. And the crowd goes absolutely wild.

493
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,800
Roundabout, the Leland Standford, Jr. University, marching band. Uh, here on the daily source code.

494
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,160
Actually, I'm, I have about, uh, what is it? To 10 more minutes, and then I'm going to do a Skype call.

495
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,080
It's almost 2pm here in the UK. So, uh, I'll be 9 a.m. people on the East Coast waking up.

496
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,400
Um, and, um, may I just say, although I'm always a bit wary of complimenting technology too much,

497
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,240
because that's usually when Murphy goes, ah, pound of fuck with you. Um, Skype really is rocking.

498
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,280
I mean, these guys, they have it. Stay ahead. It's great. I love it. I totally love it. I,

499
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:49,000
can build a virtual company using Skype. You know, it is, it's just outrageous. The conferencing capability.

500
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Certainly now they're available on the Mac. You know, a conference in two, three people who are on Skype,

501
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,000
then conference in someone just by calling a phone number. Um, and, you know, make no mistake.

502
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,960
Skype is the phone company. This is what's going to happen. They, uh, they already have,

503
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,640
what is it? How many people are online right now? So, 2.2 million users online,

504
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:17,480
a percentage of them has Skype out. I think it's like 900,000 of them have Skype out and are using that.

505
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:25,480
So, you pay 1.1 euro cents a minute anywhere in the world to make a phone call. As a little bit more,

506
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,000
if you call cell phones in the Netherlands, for instance, but still it's a great deal. It's good

507
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,120
to deal. You're going to get almost anywhere else down to pennies. Um, so everyone's kind of used

508
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,560
to this combination of free-foning and then using Skype to make phone calls because it's incredibly

509
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,600
cost-effective. And next, they give everybody Skype in, which means you can have a phone number

510
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,000
wherever you are, wherever you want it to be. And then they're the phone companies, as far as I'm concerned.

511
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,240
So, excellent. I really love what those guys are doing. And that is, that to me is ground-breaking

512
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,800
stuff. Um, congratulations to the former Cazard dudes who served their shop once in Amsterdam. Very cool.

513
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,440
Okay. So, finishing it off just following on some questions or some questions that

514
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,320
were raised during one of my, I think, Mr. Mom Podcast, Terry Wogan Show on BBC 2 on Radio 2,

515
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:25,480
runs from 730 to 930. Um, and that's according to an email from Jonathan, who goes through a

516
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,760
little more detail about Terry's show. So, if you want to find out about that, check the show notes

517
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,800
for today's podcast, which is March 9th, 2005. And also, it says something very interesting about

518
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,120
dish washes. I'm going to, because I'm saying, I'm not a big fan of dish washes, because basically

519
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,320
you're handling the plates twice, you know, putting a minute taking about. And here's what Jonathan

520
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,440
said, and I like this. He says, there's a school of thought that holds that you need two dish washers

521
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,440
and no cupboards in your kitchen. Start off with one dishwasher full of clean crockery and cutlery,

522
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,520
which means plates and so forth. As items are used, stack them in the other dishwasher. When

523
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,520
it's full, run it, take the clean dishes, as needed from it, then stack them in the first one,

524
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:15,160
and so on. I'm like, dude, that's like totally a great idea. I'm really digging that.

525
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,960
Two dish washes. I think that we have stumbled upon something really, really, really big here.

526
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,760
Right on, the official one. Well, hello Adam. This is hit test number 20. Right on.

527
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,480
And if you're ready, we haven't done this one yet, have we?

528
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,200
Wait, this is number one. Okay.

529
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
And one more time.

530
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,320
I'm Genesis.

531
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Time. Time.

532
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,360
Second time.

533
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,840
Fan. My being. I can't walk. I can't walk.

534
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,000
This is number two. I can't dance. I can't dance.

535
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,480
I can't dance.

536
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,520
I can't. I can't.

537
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,240
I can't.

538
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,520
I can't.

539
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,480
Yeah.

540
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,880
I know this is, that's Jenna Jackson and Nasty, and you're playing all those songs that I guess that we're wrong.

541
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,840
And this is number three.

542
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah, one more time.

543
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,440
Right over that is.

544
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,120
That's the guys who remind me of my horrible hairdressers, Tony and Guy, there will be

545
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,960
salmon Dave and hold on. I'm coming.

546
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,960
And these are the answers. This is so man, so man, so man.

547
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm a soulmate with Genesis.

548
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,120
I can't dance.

549
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Genesis.

550
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,760
And so number one. And this is answer number two.

551
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,360
It's Jenna Jackson.

552
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,600
Nasty. Yeah.

553
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,960
Nasty.

554
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Jenna Jackson, Nasty.

555
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,640
And this is answer number three.

556
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,920
Well, hey, everybody, it's Tony and Guy.

557
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
And salmon.

558
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,080
That's not bad.

559
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,480
Thank you.

560
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,720
Well, that's what you call stereo.

561
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,080
Yeah, I'm not sure.

562
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,600
salmon Dave and soul man.

563
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,480

571
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,920
Bye-bye.

572
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,400
No, I mean, and do, I totally love this.

573
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,240
I mean, I'm wondering, are it is Yana use sending me a message that maybe you're

574
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,640
getting tired of it? Is that is that possible?

575
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,480
I mean, I think it's amazing you do this thing.

576
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,240
And obviously, it doesn't fit in all the time when I'm on the road.

577
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,880
Although, if I have this kind of setup and it didn't sound like crappy and it, you know,

578
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,040
well, you've heard the things that are going wrong, but it feels very powerful to actually

579
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,600
sit here just be holding the iPod and controlling the recording of the show or basically

580
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
all the elements of the show through it.

581
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,640
It feels great.

582
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,720
So, no, Yana, I totally love it, totally.

583
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,080
And, you know, if I skip one, don't worry about it, you know, you can skip one too.

584
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,480
I should not be a problem, really.

585
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,320
One more thing I wanted to mention, and then I have, you know, what we're going to do

586
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,400
another mash-up just to end it off today because I feel, well, no, should we do another mash-up?

587
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,600
No, we shouldn't do another mash-up. I happen to make this phone call too.

588
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,920
So, let me just get the final tunes queued up here a whole lot of a second.

589
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,880
Can I still pause that?

590
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,080
No, no, no, pause. Okay. What that work?

591
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,880
Shoot. Okay, so there's some interface stuff we go to think about here.

592
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,320
No, what I, I just want to final thing,

593
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,240
continuing what I told you about yesterday about this new company that I'm really excited about.

594
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,960
A big part of this company will be about

595
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,800
creativity, content, and the people that produce that.

596
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,000
And in the next few days, I'll be talking to you about a couple of names that we'll be working with,

597
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,760
and I'm very, very excited.

598
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,560
And that's it for your source code for today.

599
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,160
I'm going to leave you hanging at that. If you have any comments,

600
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,440
it's adamantcurry.com. You can get the new shows and final the archives at dailysourceco.com.

601
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,000
Of course, that's also where you can find the podcast feed.

602
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,680
It's RSS 2.0. And that is my weblog. That's www.curry.com.

603
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,040
So I'm going to do some some calls, some Skype calls,

604
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,920
enjoy every moment of that. And I'll be back tomorrow.

605
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,920
Who knows what we'll do. We'll find something fun. I really do want to say thank you all very much for the

606
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,320
wonderful emails we've received about the Patricia Pi podcast. We will definitely do more.

607
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,600
And I'll also thank you for sending in songs. I mean, people are sending us MP3s that Patricia

608
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,920
didn't even recognize that anymore. So if you've got cool stuff at home, let's see if we can

609
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,040
stump her with her own stuff. All right, everybody, take care. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye-bye.
