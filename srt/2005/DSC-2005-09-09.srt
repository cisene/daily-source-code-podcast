1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-3-8

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a battle carry.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And it is your daily source code for Friday's September 9, 2005.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's just an hour.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey!

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can do it!

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's the end of the week and it's been quite a long one.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For me at least, you know, back and forth to New York.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, just to get a door knob in New York, darling.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And it's going to be an interesting show today.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Got some really cool and fun and great news to talk about and some stuff that really sells.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So a bit bittersweet today's show is for me, certainly right now,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
because I just saw my two girls off.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They're off for the weekend.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to visit Patricia's sister IvÃ¡n and Rotterdam.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I wanted to get her on the show because people keep saying,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, bring Patricia on.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She's a lot of the show's better when she's off.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hear you.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm trying to.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Trying.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Christina's going with it.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They're going to a fashion show on Sunday.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I couldn't fly myself, unfortunately.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But I got a great deal on KLM this time around.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now I'm going to do it.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to do it.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because KLM happens to have a couple of flights,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
where they call their city hop or they go straight to Rotterdam,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
which is very convenient much better than easy jet to Amsterdam,

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and then an hour in the car, and they'll be basically right there,

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and the family can pick them up.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And it's a nice little convenient,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
a fucker 100 dual turbo prop.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a nice play.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And the ticket price unbelievable,

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
round trip for the two of the $198.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's almost nothing.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I've got all my instructions.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You know, everything I have to do around the house.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Which includes, well, you know, feeding the dogs.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've got to feed myself.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've got to keep everything clean.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've got to, I'm so pussy with.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And I've got a whole list of stuff that I kind of do.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We got some interesting pod take music that was submitted on the show today.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And of course, you're going to kick it off with a mashup.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This came from mashuptown.com.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Base 211.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I'm kind of conscious going over there.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's oblatif.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
10.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a lot of bitches up here at the night, boy.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm about to get drunk.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's whole damn.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What a barat.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No more fuckers.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've always got a career.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I like you busy.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And this party in here.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I'm ready to talk.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I'm ready to talk.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I'm ready to go see her.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She arrived again inside.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I ain't gonna be able to pull it to the side.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And invited the chairs.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Pull up the chair.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I can swear.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No drama.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Put care for a player.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Workin' with a mind stuff.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I ain't got time to waste.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's vacate the place.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That blind's a trace.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Trying to deface in the ground.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We stay cast to trade.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You'll find it.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're bound to kick.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What we found is fate.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We can watch to incredible mace.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Master beat.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why settle away?

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's sescalate.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
To the never super alien.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Seek your rivers on the rivers.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And let's get rid of movie shakes.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come on.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And this is my favorite song.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Listen along.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And the DJ throws it on.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And if I leave you tonight.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I fall asleep.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And wake up.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hopefully she got some tea.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this is my favorite song.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Listen along.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And the DJ throws it on.

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And if I leave you tonight.

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I fall asleep.

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And wake up.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hopefully she got some tea.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Holy Holy Mary.

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wake around the club.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who do you everywhere?

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She caught me standing in my homies.

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Damn it.

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Me do approach.

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Can't make she smile on what's here.

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But she got a vanilla.

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But your turns are baby fathers.

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Baby bottles in cereal.

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She out like us.

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I got a lot of the nerdy.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, the DJ's pan.

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, be so on the steady.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, and she's in pain.

123
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That she wants to be here.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No.

125
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
With the real thing.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Not the deal though client.

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I know I don't want to be here.

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And home with some double deals.

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Full of silicone.

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tinned red chicks around me outside.

131
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Found me outside.

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Clown me outside.

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Tell I pop the truck.

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And they found me outside.

135
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Busting at the bitches screaming.

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, today right.

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And this is my favorite song.

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Listen along.

139
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And the DJ throws it on.

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And if I leave you tonight.

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I fall asleep.

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And wake up.

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hopefully she got some tea.

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And this is my favorite song.

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Listen along.

146
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And the DJ throws it on.

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And if I leave you tonight.

148
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I fall asleep.

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And wake up.

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hopefully she got some tea.

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Roll up all these everywhere.

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Gotta find a certain chick's atmosphere.

153
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, be so these blaring.

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And then she got me fair.

155
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then she don't come over here.

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then try to eat me.

157
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let it run.

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Leave.

159
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like a box of cherry.

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yo's carry cupcakes.

161
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And chocolate.

162
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Titsy rolls.

163
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How am I to order?

164
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Cause I got a big girl.

165
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This order.

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So the cover up.

167
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They're blah blah.

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, I split.

169
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I got time to play.

170
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Less investigate.

171
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Another place today.

172
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ladies, less in weight.

173
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Dresses, petite.

174
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No window drapes.

175
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Words about them.

176
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They got them.

177
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
All grand beings.

178
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Got your open jeans.

179
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Seems to be a little link was seen.

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Wouldn't hurt much.

181
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No touchy.

182
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And this is my favorite song.

183
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Listen along.

184
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And the DJ throws it on.

185
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And if I leave you tonight.

186
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I fall asleep.

187
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And wake up.

188
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hopefully she got some tea.

189
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And this is my favorite song.

190
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Listen along.

191
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And the DJ throws it on.

192
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And if I leave you tonight.

193
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I fall asleep.

194
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And wake up.

195
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hopefully she got some tea.

196
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh.

197
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh.

198
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh.

199
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh.

200
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah.

201
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You gotta have tea, baby.

202
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's just what looked right.

203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But me, be honest.

204
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know tea.

205
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,880
And we're working, all of a sudden.

206
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Yeah.

207
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm feeling good.

208
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Shaded back this day.

209
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, be Christ.

210
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Come on.

211
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I think those Beatles guys should do something together.

212
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I turn out to be some from mashuptown.com.

213
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think there's some kind of this is a contest submission or a contest winner.

214
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It seems like the given away iTunes stuff over there.

215
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
iTunes music store downloads and as you go check it out, mashuptown.com.

216
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tell Art, I sent you.

217
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

218
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
One of the reasons that the source code is late today,

219
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
or later the normal is now, what is it?

220
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
720, almost 730.

221
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh man, East Enders is coming on.

222
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's because I had a two and a half hour chat with Cast Blaster Mike,

223
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
who was a developing Cast Blaster.

224
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And we had some really creative discussion.

225
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We always spar with each other.

226
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because I'm horrible at getting back to people.

227
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And he hates that.

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But then the creative juice is really started to flow.

229
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And we were able to teach each other a couple of things.

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And he's now working on something that I'm so excited about.

231
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Which I'm just going to tell you because I mean,

232
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
he's totally got all the pieces in place.

233
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It just has to learn a bit about the one reason why,

234
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
or the number one reason I should say, why I'm not using Cast Blaster

235
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to record the daily source code.

236
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now there's a number of reasons.

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And we've talked about a pro version.

238
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And what should be in the basic version.

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And well, one of the things,

240
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
see, when I do a podcast,

241
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I've been doing radio since I was 14.

242
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And we really pioneered a lot of different ways

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
to kind of adapt and hack if you will.

244
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Traditional audio recording and studio equipment

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
into systems that would work for the type of art that we do.

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And this pertains completely to podcasts as well.

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
For instance, back in the day when we played vinyl,

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
remember those days.

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And we, of course, could not afford, or we called a quick start turn table.

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think techniques was really the SL was at 2000.

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't remember the SL 100, maybe.

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That was the first turn table that could really start up a record.

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You could cue it.

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So basically, you put the needle drop the needle down.

255
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For those of you who've never seen a record player,

256
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
you drop the needle on the, drop the needle on the record.

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the drums just go like this.

258
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Sorry about that.

259
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then the minute the song starts,

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you'd stop it with your finger.

261
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And the reason you could do that is because we put a slip mat.

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
First, we'd put an old 12 inch LP.

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We put that on the turn table.

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then we'd put a, we call a slip mat,

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
which is like a velvet anti-static mat,

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but an oversized one.

267
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we'd cut it out of velvet ourselves.

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And it would be anti-static as well.

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So that if you grab that mat,

270
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
then basically the record that would sit on top of that,

271
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
would not play.

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But underneath the turn table was still turning.

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now granted a little bit slower than, you know,

274
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the desired revolutions per minute.

275
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But that was the beauty of it.

276
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
As when you let go of the felt mat,

277
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
then within a quarter revolution,

278
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
it would be up to speed.

279
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And you could start the song with start playing.

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
In fact, sometimes, and that's called queuing.

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sometimes we'd queue up the records too tight.

282
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then it would kind of like,

283
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
whew, kind of like, you know,

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
horrible in there while I was getting up the speed.

285
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And you know, that used to be a part of the art is

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
how tight can you queue the record.

287
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And the way you started it and get this is

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
we break open telco relays.

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Relay for those you've never seen one is essentially

290
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
an electro magnet that when activated,

291
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
when current flows through the electro magnet,

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
it then pulls down the metallic hinge.

293
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And it goes click.

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And that can, of course, in turn create a circuit.

295
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But we weren't using that for the circuit part of the

296
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
relay opening or closing.

297
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We were using that.

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We'd break off the plastic housing.

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then we'd have the slip mat run in between

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the electro magnet and the lid.

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So when you activate it,

302
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
click it, it would basically grab the mat.

303
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So then we put micro switches.

304
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I hope you don't mind me getting into this.

305
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's just, you know, it is kind of important to know

306
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
where I'm coming from with this stuff.

307
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We put micro switches in the faders.

308
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So basically the volume sliders on the mixing board.

309
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We opened it up and put the micro switches in there.

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So that when you had the fader closed,

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
then current would flow through the magnet

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and it would keep the record in place.

313
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then we had an override switch right in front of each

314
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
turn table.

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We had two.

316
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You clicked that.

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The relay would open and then it would start playing.

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So you could queue it up.

319
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Click the override off.

320
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And then when you open up the fader, boom.

321
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I just opened up a secondary mic fader here.

322
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But literally, you know, sometimes you hit it so hard that the

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
button would go flying off.

324
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You know, this is the old school old school days of

325
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
how you used to do it.

326
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And, you know, I remember when we had our first CD play,

327
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
when we played our first CD, it blew out the transmitter

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
because the frequency range was so broad.

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Anyway, so I'm very, very used to,

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
basically flying blind.

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't have to look at the mixer to know what I'm doing.

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I'm already adapting quite a bit with the set up.

333
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now, because, you know, everything's coming out of

334
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
megasegue.

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So basically, if I want to start something,

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and it's all queued up, then I, then I just hit the

337
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
bit of button on my Mac and then it plays.

338
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And then I, you know, I'm also doing a final mix

339
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
basically of the show.

340
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I'm riding the faders a little bit and, you know,

341
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
when stuff is a little bit too loud or if I want to

342
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
sound more in the background.

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So you're doing a lot of things.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And you can't do that if you have to do it with a mouse

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
on a screen.

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So we talked about the idea of hooking up a MIDI controller,

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
which we'll have a number of faders and buttons to start

348
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
stuff and connecting that to cast blaster.

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I'm excited about this because it'll have,

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
it'll be such a tremendous benefit.

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Now, this Yamaha-per-first professional audio

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
workstation AW16G because the R is left on the

353
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
tarmac.

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a heavy thing, you know, but it's basically a big

355
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
cast blaster like piece of software on a hard drive

356
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
with a computer.

357
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Only it's not built with the functionality of cast

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
blaster, which, of course, is why it doesn't

359
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
really suffice.

360
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But it does have a number of things that work well.

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And one of them is that I can basically mix

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
stuff.

363
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And there's some other ancillary things like processing

364
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
etc.

365
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But, you know, there are ways to solve that.

366
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So anyway, this is something that I think would be a

367
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
great addition to cast blaster to have that capability

368
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
built right in.

369
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So that you can use that on the screen if you want,

370
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but if you want to plug in your MIDI controller,

371
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
so you have faders and buttons to start stuff with,

372
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
wow, how freaking cool will that be.

373
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So I just wanted to say that that was very, very exciting.

374
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

375
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
734, everybody.

376
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
AAC writes Jeff from podcast shuffle show.

377
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So rather than stir up controversy and talking behind you back,

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
talk podcast alley and other forms about the acquisition.

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I just asked directly.

380
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, I see.

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It says, rather than stir up controversy and talking behind you,

382
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
back, back, talk podcast.

383
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, I don't know what that behind you back.

384
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Talk podcast alley.

385
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know what you're saying.

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I know what you're saying, but it's a weird sentence.

387
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll just ask directly.

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
A lot of folks, not me, says Jeff,

389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
were surprised about the acquisition.

390
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Maybe you can say a few words on a daily source code

391
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
now that the deal is done.

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's a good point.

393
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I'll tell you why I haven't mentioned it

394
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is because we've been working with Chris McIntyre

395
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
who created podcast alley and is the,

396
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the heart of that community.

397
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You know, we've been working with him for months.

398
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You know, and we had meetings in New York.

399
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And we certainly, I certainly have talked about him a lot

400
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and have been promoting podcast alley.

401
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We've just been working with him for so long

402
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that it felt, you know, so natural.

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He's just, he's there.

404
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean, he's moved out to San Francisco.

405
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He's, he's relocated.

406
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And he's also splitting his time with his lovely wife

407
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and Nashville.

408
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I mean, he's, he's really very committed.

409
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Just another one of the, and I think it's now 25 people.

410
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Podcastors, producers, engineers, developers,

411
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
business people, designers, project managers

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that, you know, that believed in this crazy ass vision

413
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that we have and have, you know, have followed Ron and I

414
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and, you know, and that was not necessarily a free ride.

415
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You know, the people who really had to work

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and really had to help us out and step up

417
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and we have an incredible, incredible team.

418
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And what's cool now is I have,

419
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I've, I'm starting to relive eye chat

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
for the video capabilities.

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I said, I was missing stuff at the office.

422
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I just didn't feel a part of it when I'm not there.

423
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And so, well, why don't we set up a power book and

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
KJ, Chris Jacob has had an old power book, I guess,

425
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that the hinges had fallen off or something.

426
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And they've set it up, it's that's kind of like my office space

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and through eye chat, we can just have a full-time video

428
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
connection.

429
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And we have, it's a very open office in general.

430
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for me to be talking

431
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
here and other people being able to overhear it

432
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and vice versa.

433
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So that's pretty natural.

434
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I found this great apple script,

435
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I hunted around for it, but found it on Google.

436
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I chat TV script, which is,

437
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
was built for a different reason.

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It was created so that you could watch whatever

439
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
your television is running or your TV was running at home.

440
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And I hacked it up a little bit.

441
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And so now I basically have a remote control

442
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
so that if I set my status to a certain message,

443
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and, of course, that message is coming from my unique identifier.

444
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So go ahead, set the message.

445
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're not going to be able to get in.

446
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then the other machine, in this case, the one in San Francisco,

447
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
will automatically request a video chat with me.

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So, you know, I could turn it on and off.

449
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And that's very cool.

450
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I've set it up here at the cottage,

451
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
so I can do that from remote and do the same thing

452
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
from my laptop.

453
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So, and it really does make a difference.

454
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You know, we have lots of Skype calls and conferences,

455
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
but being able to see everybody and just kind of

456
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
shout back and forth.

457
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And of course, I've rigged up the output of my studio

458
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
into eye chat so that I can play stuff.

459
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And, unfortunately, I can't, they can't watch and listen

460
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
along as I'm doing the daily source code,

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
because it's too much stress on the machine to do video

462
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and to be recording straight to MP3,

463
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
because that is my recording machine.

464
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So, until I get a dedicated machine for some of the video

465
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
stuff, I will peel to do that.

466
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But, and I don't know if I'll feel comfortable

467
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
with it quite honestly.

468
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's kind of weird.

469
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

470
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are we ready for some bummer shit?

471
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This is really fucked up.

472
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So, one of our community has fallen ill

473
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and it's very chilling to me.

474
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I've been a big fan and subscribed to the Skype

475
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to Calleady podcast.

476
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I was turned on to Skype to Calleady by PW,

477
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
who, of course, puts the serious pod shows together.

478
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And we featured promo and episodes of Skype to Calleady.

479
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And it's, you know, it's good stuff.

480
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's well produced, it's well put together.

481
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And PW has been actually,

482
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
he's been on my case saying,

483
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you should really talk to Derek

484
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
because, you know, he would be a great guy

485
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to do some work with on the audio side for pod show.

486
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And my travels just hadn't really allowed me to do that.

487
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And PW even sent me a tickler on that last night.

488
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Tell him I was a dickhead that hadn't called yet.

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I hadn't gotten in touch.

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And today, for multiple sources,

491
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I got some really quite shocking,

492
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
just terrible news about Derek,

493
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
as he is now in hospital with a form of aneurysm.

494
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And this news has spread very quickly through

495
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the podcast community because it is a,

496
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it is a very popular podcast.

497
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And swoopy actually put out a podcast today on the feed

498
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that I wanted to share with you,

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
just to make sure that you heard it.

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And this is one of those things that

501
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I really didn't want to do,

502
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but I unfortunately have to,

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
just to let people know that

504
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
skepticalities aren't really going anywhere,

505
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but we are going to be on a little bit of a hiatus for a little while.

506
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Derek, unfortunately,

507
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
he is in the hospital at this time.

508
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
He complained of a headache during dinner

509
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and then got physically sick and very quickly deteriorated,

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
but thankfully by that time he was nearly to the hospital

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
where he was diagnosed with a VMA,

512
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
which loosely translated although not correct,

513
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
is somewhat like a brain aneurysm,

514
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
where he was bleeding into his brain.

515
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He is in a coma right now,

516
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but it is drug induced as he is sedated,

517
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and he is on a ventilator,

518
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and he is intensive care.

519
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
His wife Susan and myself

520
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
are surrounded by friends

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and Derek's family is coming from New Jersey,

522
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so this is the fastest way

523
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that I could let people know what was going on

524
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and today was actually a really great day to start with

525
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
because we found out that

526
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
skepticality was one of the top nine podcasts

527
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
that Steve Jobs mentioned,

528
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and he showed our picture

529
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
at his Apple keynote address introducing iTunes 5

530
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and we were excited,

531
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and that was about an hour before

532
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the world changed a lot for everyone.

533
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So it is very too soon to know

534
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
his prognosis at this time

535
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
is that he will be in intensive care

536
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in the hospital for at least several weeks.

537
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I have faith in his doctors

538
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and I have faith in all of you.

539
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Please don't send anything.

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I mean, you can send email

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and things like that, but it is too soon.

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It is too soon to know

543
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and for what could have happened today

544
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it worked out really well

545
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
because if he would have been home

546
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and he had a headache

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and he wouldn't lay down

548
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
he may very well have died in his sleep

549
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and this way at least we caught it as fast as possible.

550
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He was to the doctor as fast as possible.

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They believe the pressure in his head

552
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and beginning training that blood out is fast as possible.

553
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And he's a strong guy, he's a young guy.

554
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He's in pretty good shape.

555
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So this is one of those things

556
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that nobody could have forcing.

557
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And I like Derek, we trust science

558
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and hopefully science will help us out this time.

559
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And we're going to get through this

560
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but for now, just

561
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you know that I'll be around

562
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and we have some great shows

563
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that we haven't been able to share with you yet.

564
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So that may be coming, but in the meantime,

565
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that's pretty much all there is.

566
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So thanks.

567
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's like the fourth time I've heard that

568
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and it gets me every single time.

569
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I guess the only thing that we can do

570
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is to have that Derek and Suppy and Susan

571
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and all people who are close to them

572
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
in our thoughts and in our prayers.

573
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Thank you.

574
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Thank you.

575
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Thank you.

576
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Thank you.

577
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Thank you.

578
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Thank you.

579
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Thank you.

580
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Thank you.

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you.

582
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thank you.

583
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Thank you.

584
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Thank you.

585
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Thank you.

586
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know, one of the, uh,

587
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
one of the things you do

588
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and professional broadcasting

589
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is transition really quickly from

590
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
from mood to mood, you know.

591
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Hey, my name's Simon Gege.

592
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm from pale spring.

593
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, that's an example.

594
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Fuck.

595
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Um.

596
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So look at the news.

597
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And it'll go from, you know,

598
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
a really sad human interest story

599
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
segment.

600
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's all human interest, basically.

601
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
To, uh,

602
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and now meanwhile on Wall Street.

603
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Uh, but I really have a heart.

604
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm doing that.

605
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I feel like I'm just a little bit bombed.

606
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
There's still, uh, hurricane Katrina,

607
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and he had those birds.

608
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I was never beautiful in the background.

609
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, let me open up the secondary mic.

610
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Uh, let me just position it.

611
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Hold on a second, sure.

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's kind of a shitty sounding mic,

613
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I want, but I've got some kind of gate on it.

614
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay, so now, won't pick anything up.

615
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
All right, how's it, fun experiment?

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Uh, let's see, oh,

617
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
do I have a really, I told you about that.

618
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,920
interesting potsafe piece of music coming up. We'll just check the old on the

619
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,640
outliner here. No, it is now time for the promo that interrupts us so

620
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
rudely prior to this message.

621
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,640
The webpage especially dedicated to this brand new podcast is at HTTP. I miss

622
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,080
blighty.logspot.com. I'll give you that again in just a moment. The podcast is

623
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,520
every two weeks and we feature news from the UK. Not the kind of news you'll

624
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,080
find on the TV or radio but more the kind of news you'll find down the pub.

625
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,400
Which is just how we like it. Plus every time we have a recipe for you cook up a

626
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,600
bit of Britain wherever you are in the world and of course we want to hear your

627
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,160
comments, stories, suggestions and we got some good tunes too. So remember that

628
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,000
name. I miss blighty. Our web address where you can sign up to the RSS

629

HTTP. I miss blighty.logspot.com. We're looking forward to seeing you there.

631
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,360
We're looking forward to you subscribing. And hey Adam, if the room is a true, maybe

632
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,640
you'll be subscribing yourself soon. Take care. Thanks for your time.

633
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,200
Hi Jill. Content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother.

634
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,400
Hello Adam. This is Mark Phillips from the FBS Multimedia podcast. I'm here in London

635
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,840
at the launch of the new iPod Nano because I know they've the source code listeners

636
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,800
tend to get everywhere and of course we're here as well and also the iTunes phone and iTunes

637
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,080
version 5 as well. And I must say I'm one of the first people to actually get my hands

638
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,040
on one of these iPod Nano's and man they are sleek and sexy and tiny and I think Apple

639
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,920
have another winner. Anyway, I've been looking for an excuse to send you a trail or a promo

640
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,880
for the show for some time. So here it is. It's called BFBS Multimedia. You can find

641
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:39,840
this at www.bfbs.bravo.com slash Multimedia and it's presented by Dave Raven and

642
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,600
myself Mark Phillips and it's the friendly podcast about computers, the internet and technology.

643
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,880
As I say, we've been running now for quite some time and we have a lot of fun. We actually

644
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,640
make the show on a house boat on the Thames but that's a whole other story which may

645
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,640
be all I'll tell you another time. Anyway, do have a listen to the show. It's at bfbs.com

646
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:12,360
slash Multimedia and keep up the good work with the Doni source code.

647
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,080
You know what's even better than a house boat on the Thames? A podcasting buddy with a

648
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,880
house boat on the Thames. Oh yeah, I've got some podcasts. I'm subscribed to Boyd and

649
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:33,080
Multimedia. I did the jobcast. I played the jobcast Sunday to Monday. Of course, we talked

650
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,400
about the idea of getting CV cast back and we received them. We've actually received

651
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,600
MP3s and someone even dropped an eye river in envelope. Please don't do that. There's

652
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,880
no need to do it. Just email us an MP3 or a link to an MP3 file. But it's fantastic. I was

653
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,840
like itching to play a couple of these for you. But you know, obviously there's a whole bunch

654
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,480
of reasons why I can't. The no one has it has expressly said go ahead and play it. But if you're

655
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,480
going to do a CV cast, you don't mind me playing a bit on the edges so we can kind of close

656
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,120
that loop from the jobcast. And we're going to do another jobcast because we just went through

657
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,320
some requirements about some more resources we need. And I think this is a very cool way to

658
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,400
you know, to get the right type of people in because, well, if you listen to podcasts, then

659
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:25,200
you know, that's already one big checkbox A. Some more feedback here. Rod Templeton. Victor

660
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,920
Echo 7 Romeo, Julia Tango from Vancouver, British Columbia. Just to note that, say, thanks

661
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,040
for acknowledging the work that the ham operators have been doing since the storm hit New Orleans

662
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,680
last week. There've been a number of stories in the media about how they're helping to keep

663
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,320
communication lines open during this devastating period of time while there are a number of

664
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,480
HF communication nets running constantly. There are also a couple of services that use voice

665
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,720
over IP as their primary method of communication. And there's a couple of links there to the

666
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,800
voice over IP weather net. Both of them. And then the IRIP, IRLP dot net, both of these sites offer

667
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,040
streaming audio of the communications when the nets are active as they probably will be next week.

668
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,000
When the next storm started making their way west. Okay. So in just in this aside,

669
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,640
a lot of people emailed me this. More code is no longer required for access to some parts

670
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,960
of the ham spectrum in the US and is not required at all appear in Canada. Okay. Maybe I should

671
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,160
get a ham license. I wonder what the requirements are here in the UK. Now be kind of cool. That's

672
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,360
really what we need. Isn't it a ham radio here? And we need to assume some slow scan television

673
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,520
and uh, yeah. But it's cool though to see the ham operators that are really helping out with the

674
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,760
hurricane Katrina. Incoming subs-based signal signal signal signal signal signal signal signal signal.

This is revtym from revtym.com. Member of the godcast network. Many people are making requests

676
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,760
to those with any means possible to contribute to Hurricane Katrina's victims.

677
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,600
Truly, this is a tremendous catastrophe, the likes of which we will be learning for months to come.

678
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,760
In Matthew 936, it says when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were

679
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,000
harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd. We all know that there will be time for anger

680
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,800
and analysis, but now is the time for help and for our prayers. Later on, there will be time

681
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:39,360
for addressing the leadership issues and procedures. What the overwhelmed people need at this moment

682
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:47,200
is hope, not division. They need comfort, not more distress. So please, focus on being united

683
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,040
in helping the families left so devastated by this tragedy that frankly most of us escaped.

684
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,400
We are asking for you to pray for your prayers. We are asking for compassion and for thoughtful

685
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,800
understanding to all of the hurting during this time of great pain. And most of all, let us bring

686
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:13,440
hope to the hopeless and to provide strength in the time of enormous hardship. This is Rev Tim

689
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Thank you and may God bless you.

690
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,240
I love Rev Tim. He really, I listen to all his podcasts or as many as possible.

691
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,080
He's always got inspiring. He really is.

692
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:49,600
So is Warren Atkinson who said, Adam, just listen to your hotel podcast. This is earlier

693
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,560
in the week from New York. Hadn't heard you before. You got potential. But do yourself a favor.

694
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,600
Get yourself a producer. Bit too much dribble, dribble, dribble. Having said that, let me say this.

695
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,480
Keep going. Thanks Warren. I'll try and do something with this.

696
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,920
Merrill. Oh, this is nice. Yeah. This is a Merrill sent in a pod save tune for me to play for it,

697
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,520
which I'm going to play. Said for the last week, I vacation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.

698
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,960
We opted to drive there rather than fly. And the trek was around 1100 miles from Austin, Texas to

699
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,720
Estus Park, Colorado. Estus, I guess, or Eastus, Estus? No matter how you cut it, I loaded up.

700
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,480
No matter how you cut it. I loaded up a couple of weeks worth of the daily source code into my

701
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,720
iPod with FMI trip. So you could presumably hear it on the the car radio. And you kept me

702
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,640
company on my journey driving into the night. I must say that I've never been so entertained

703
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,960
for such a long period of time. Oh, Merrill, I love spending that in those nights with you.

704
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,200
It's amazing how intimate of an experience it is hearing your voice rambling to me. While driving

705
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,240
on a dark highway at 70 miles per hour around 3am, when my kids in wife with my kids and wife

706
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,520
sleeping in the seats next to me, I couldn't have done the trip without you and your daily source.

707
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,920
So thank you for the podcast, but okay, anyway. So then out of the blue, Merrill

708
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,080
provides a pod save tune, which I did check it out. It is actually pod save. I don't think it's

709
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,320
listed on the pod save music network yet. And it kind of sounded like this was a vinyl recording,

710
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,560
but I think it's intended to sound that way. But it's just a kind of tune that I definitely like.

711
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,840
It's a Dick and Jane. You know, I'm trying to like Dick and Jane. It's got to be good, right?

712
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,280
So for some reason and rightly so, Merrill thought that I would like this tune,

713
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,520
and I do. It's not really bad. It's titled Not the Way You Need.

714
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:14,960
I burn bridges just to see if they've got a few to burn. I can't get my head to learn.

715
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,960
Yeah.

716
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:38,160
What the hell is wrong with me? Oh, your shackles just to see if they've got a whole different

717
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,160
way. Can't get my head to learn.

718
00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:01,520
What the hell is wrong with you? You find a little turning around.

719
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:12,800
Yeah. You claw your way back to me. Can't you get your eyes to see?

720
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:30,000
What the hell is wrong with you? You tried my every move.

721
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Keep in watch over me.

722
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,960
Can't you get your eyes to see?

723
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,160
I don't love you. I don't love you.

724
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,680
I mean, I can't love you. I can't love you.

725
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm the way you need.

726
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:16,160
I gotta follow my own. Learn to do it alone.

727
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:31,360
There's no one leaning on me. I gotta set you free.

728
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:42,880
What the hell is wrong with me? I let you take the lead.

729
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:56,400
You got my head to learn. Can't get my head to learn.

730
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:07,840
What the hell is wrong with you? You tried my every move.

731
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:15,120
I love them to prove to just let me go.

732
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Can't you get your pretty eyes to see? I don't love you.

733
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,560
What I mean is I can't love you.

734
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:39,040
I can't love you. I'm the way you need.

735
00:40:39,040 --> 00:41:08,640
I'm sorry for this. I ain't kind of like a

736
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,800
a downer laid back maybe a little bit mellow podcast but that's it.

737
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,480
Have yourself a really great weekend everybody. Thanks for listening. Thanks for

738
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,920
subscribing. I'm tired of the rock money and off at the end of the show. I say the

739
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,360
same thing every single time anyway.

740
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:39,840
Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.
