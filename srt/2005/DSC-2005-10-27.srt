1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-6-8

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You know the weird guy in the corner of the office who always has his headphones on?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's you!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ah, Joe!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There are no secrets!

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Only information you don't get out of!

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Adam Curry!

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass!

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears!

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We don't need no sticky ingredients!

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Just take it!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's Adam Curry!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it's Thursday only two more days like get to go home!

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
October 27th!

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was looking for that clip of Dorothy saying,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I wish I could go home!

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I wish I could go home!

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I wish I could go home!

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I could only just click my heels together three times in my Ruby Red Slippers

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I'll be transported back and forth!

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Eight Thursday everybody!

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Good morning! How are you doing?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Running about half an hour later than usual,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because I've got some chores to do here at the condo.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's at 9.17.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Once again from Curry condo and let's see.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, it's kind of overcast,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but I think it's going to be a beautiful day here in Northern California.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The lateness, I'm not that you noticed it,

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
because you're getting the show whenever you usually get it,

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is because I got the machine room running full speed.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've got a load on.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've got a load in the wash.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I've got a load in the dryer,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
because I only had underwear for 10-day stay.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's the power of Curry.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not going to tell you I am so excited.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I'll tell you what.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In fact, we'll talk about that a lot today.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I had one of those major epiphanies last night.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You know, we just just before you go to bed,

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you're like, oh my god!

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And then all of a sudden, it all fits together

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and everything just clicks in the place that makes sense.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I almost couldn't get the sleep.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's how excited I was.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll be sure to tell you a little bit about the epiphanies.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's book up your definition of epiphanies too,

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
just so we're talking about the right thing.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hold on, I'm going to get to dictionary.com.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And to kick it off today.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You smell it?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know if I should be concerned, but it smells like destiny's child.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And we'll see you back.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can fix it.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me talk.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Friends, you can fix it.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
CJ.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Join the night.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Spending night.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll see you in the bed.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They want it.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Follow better.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't turn.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Take me.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can you hear the pain of me?

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's so useless.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll get with me.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll get with you.

187
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll get with you.

188
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll get with you.

189
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll get with you.

190
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll get with you.

191
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll get with you.

192
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll get with you.

193
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll get with you.

194
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll get with you.

195
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll get with you.

196
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll get with you.

197
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll get with you.

198
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll get with you.

199
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll get with you.

200
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll get with you.

201
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll get with you.

202
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll get with you.

203
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll get with you.

204
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll get with you.

205
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll get with you.

206
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll get with you.

207
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll get with you.

208
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll get with you.

209
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll get with you.

210
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll get with you.

211
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll get with you.

212
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll get with you.

213
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll get with you.

214
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll get with you.

215
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

216
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was right.

217
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Big pile of booty lissus here on the floor in the condo.

218
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. DJ remake smells like Destiny's Child on the Daily Source.

219
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Go Thursday 27th of October 2005.

220
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

221
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So as I said, I was planning on kind of being on my way home by now.

222
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's a weird pact for.

223
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But all flights fully booked up Saturdays the first.

224
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I really sucks, man.

225
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
At least I wish I could have left on Friday because you lose a day.

226
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So now instead of arriving Saturday arrives Sunday.

227
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And of course, I have no no underwear.

228
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, I have underwear, but it has to get washed.

229
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I got a great machine.

230
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, man.

231
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hold on.

232
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's still running yet.

233
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

234
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I got to keep my eye on it because as I've been taught by my lovely wife,

235
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the minute the dryer is done, you've got to take the clothes out.

236
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Because when they're warm, then you can kind of shake them out and fold them.

237
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And then you don't have to do any ironing.

238
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So I do have to keep my eye on it.

239
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And that may be a short introduction somewhere in the middle of the source code today.

240
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, wow.

241
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know, first, I want to start with an apology first of all.

242
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's what I want to do.

243
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A couple days ago, I got an email from PWFent and PW.

244
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, he lives in Tampa, Florida.

245
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And he's been working with me for, since Pod Show was incorporated actually.

246
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He was actually working for a different company because this was all pre- Pod Show.

247
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And he is been responsible for the production of everything that happens on serious

248
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
satellite radio.

249
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So we work a lot together.

250
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But we work mostly via email and text messages.

251
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And once in a while a Skype or a phone call.

252
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so here's the context that email fucking sucks, man.

253
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You lose all context.

254
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And also the mainstream media sucks.

255
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And that's why I get to my apology.

256
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So PW sent me an email a couple days ago and he said,

257
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
you know, if we're to lose power because of, because of her arcane here,

258
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
then I really need a Windows laptop in addition to, you know,

259
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
it's other gear that he has because it,

260
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
well, there's a whole bunch of technical reasons for it.

261
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But the bottom line is that then, you know, he'll be mobile so he could still

262
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
complete the show and get it off to,

263
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you know, it's all done through networks.

264
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know, all through the internet to get the show up to,

265
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
up to serious.

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And it's pretty cool the way it works actually.

267
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And of course, I had no problem with that.

268
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But I'm like, you know, I wasn't kind.

269
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's weird because I understood what he was saying.

270
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You know, if the electricity goes out,

271
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and then of course my mind went immediately to the next step.

272
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So what if the electricity goes out,

273
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
but it goes out for 300 miles.

274
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know, I'm just thinking like,

275
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know what I'm talking about.

276
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So what's our backup plan?

277
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You know, do we have the files somewhere else?

278
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So someone in a different location could do it for instance.

279
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And we kind of went back and forth and,

280
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and we're like old women on email, man,

281
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
we can bitch and moan each other.

282
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's actually, it's a very lethargic.

283
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Lethargic is it the right word?

284
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, that's not the right word.

285
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's some sort of the wrong word.

286
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's, it makes you feel good

287
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to yell at someone over email.

288
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
As part of that person doesn't take the shit and yells back.

289
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And so I kind of let it go, you know,

290
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and I figured, all right,

291
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
so I'll figure out the laptop and electricity problems,

292
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
whatever.

293
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I'd seen, of course, on television,

294
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
just about the only coverage I really saw of Hurricane Wilma

295
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Florida was this clip that's been played over and over again.

296
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And although very funny,

297
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to see Al Roker fallen his fat face,

298
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I know Al Roker, I've met him many times,

299
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
not a nice guy.

300
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
At least that was not my experience.

301
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So that was kind of funny,

302
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
but it wasn't until yesterday that we're sitting in the office

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and Ron comes in and he's crouch behind his computer

304
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and he's like, where?

305
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And I'm like, what you talking about,

306
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you know, he's talking about all this stuff

307
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and something was fucked up.

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And what's wrong?

309
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He says, well, you know,

310
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
there's 2.8 million people without electricity in Florida,

311
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
which includes a lot of his extended family,

312
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
his wife, Martha's family lives there in Miami,

313
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and they have their condo,

314
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
which has been without power for,

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
so it's been, at least a day,

316
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
maybe even more.

317
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I'm like, what?

318
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And then you start to think about it.

319
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You know, what happens if there's no electricity?

320
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I think what happened in my mind is,

321
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
sure, I've had power go out.

322
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, we used to live in Jersey,

323
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and we'd have a blizzard,

324
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and then the power would go out,

325
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
but it would come back on, you know?

326
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But that's a blizzard.

327
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's a little different, you know,

328
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
where a power line might come down

329
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and it can basically be repaired

330
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
reasonably quickly,

331
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but when it comes to the devastation of a hurricane,

332
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
just imagine,

333
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
just imagine for a second that the power,

334
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
see what I mean?

335
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
See how fucked up that is?

336
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then that would, you know,

337
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
power would go out,

338
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
not just for a second there,

339
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
but for 24 hours,

340
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
48 hours,

341
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you know,

342
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
think of the stuff that starts to happen,

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
think of the stuff you can't do.

344
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Besides not being able to create

345
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
or listen to podcasts,

346
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think there's a lot more.

347
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And so now,

348
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
now it's clicking in my head,

349
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm going,

350
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
oh,

351
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
okay,

352
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you know,

353
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
of course,

354
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
PW was way more involved,

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you know,

356
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
living in Tampa,

357
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
way more preoccupied with what was going on,

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and I really wasn't sensitive to that.

359
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And so apologies PW.

360
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There you go honey,

361
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I love you.

362
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You know I did.

363
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Terry,

364
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
yes,

365
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Scott Sloan from the Alaska Pod Show,

366
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
way up here in Anchorage,

367
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Alaska.

368
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have a question for you,

369
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
but before I ask,

370
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'd like to thank you for plugging us in

371
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
to show number 265,

372
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but this leads to my question.

373
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was speaking with a promoter today

374
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
from an artist that is listed in the pod

375
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
safe music network.

376
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
One of the questions we had

377
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and we were discussing

378
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
was when it'd be great to collect data,

379
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
to see how well the pod safe music network

380
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is converting for the artist,

381
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
musician or even the podcaster.

382
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It would be nice to know what kind of impact

383
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the pod safe music network is making,

384
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and if this data is not available,

385
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
maybe it's something that can be plugged in

386
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to the membership side of the pod safe music network.

387
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe a simple survey

388
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that everyone could fill out

389
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and learn or communicate

390
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
how well the pod safe music network has served us.

391
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's all I have for you today.

392
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Have a great day,

393
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
take care of yourself,

394
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and from Anchorage, Alaska,

395
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
this is Scott Sloan.

396
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Scott, thank you very much.

397
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, very good question,

398
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and I have a couple answers for you.

399
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And of course, you know,

400
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the pod safe music network is so dear to my heart,

401
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and I think it's extremely,

402
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
extremely successful.

403
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think it's important to what we're doing

404
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
with pod casting.

405
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So let me address those for that question.

406
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
First of all,

407
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
yeah, we do have data,

408
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and we have some really interesting data,

409
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and we're going to start making that available very quickly.

410
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The first piece of data is the spins.

411
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now you can go to the homepage of the pod safe music network,

412
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and you can see the top spins of all time,

413
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the top listens of all time

414
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and the top rated songs.

415
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What we've done is,

416
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and we've been kind of evaluating the list,

417
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we've created top spins for the day,

418
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
top spins for the week,

419
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
top spins for the month,

420
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and top spins for all time,

421
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
a spin being when a podcaster plays the song,

422
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and then reports it back to the network.

423
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Which, by the way,

424
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you do have to do.

425
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you sign up for the pod safe music network,

426
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and you're using songs from it,

427
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you have to report when you play it.

428
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And we're going to have to,

429
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I guess,

430
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
well,

431
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
we have a couple of ways that we're policing as the wrong word,

432
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
but fuck it.

433
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We sign an agreement,

434
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the pod safe music artist put their stuff up there for you to use.

435
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
All you have to do is report back to the network.

436
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So that data is going to be made available.

437
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing,

438
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and so that's the first conversion,

439
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I guess,

440
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
you can say,

441
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
here's these songs actually being played on the different podcasts.

442
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So that will be the first metric.

443
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The next obvious metric is conversion to sales,

444
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because that is really,

445
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I would presume the way most artists are going to gauge their success,

446
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
is,

447
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you know,

448
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
whatever I've done,

449
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
have I grown my audience,

450
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and the best way to really measure that is who was purchased my CD or tracks.

451
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So that's all part of this unlabel thing I've been talking about.

452
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So,

453
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you know,

454
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that's on the way.

455
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Today is not the day to talk about that,

456
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
but that's on the way.

457
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I think those will be the two most important pieces of data.

458
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And it's,

459
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and of course,

460
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
so there's always,

461
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
so the spins is important.

462
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's a couple of different shows doing,

463
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I love hearing this,

464
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
doing the pod safe music network top 10.

465
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In addition to that,

466
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
today actually,

467
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm going to play a piece from the pod safe music rewind.

468
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The pod chose pod safe music rewind show,

469
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
which is a compilation,

470
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
a weekly compilation of all of the pod safe music shows,

471
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
or not all,

472
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but the top pod safe music shows,

473
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and just a song from each of those.

474
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a really tripping out to that yesterday.

475
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So we'll talk about that in a bit.

476
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But it's very much like what the,

477
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
what the,

478
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
the business is today.

479
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Only we've eliminated all the complicated crap.

480
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And keep your eye on it.

481
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So the Nick,

482
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know.

483
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I can't,

484
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I just had this usually a text message coming in,

485
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
so I just want to make sure that I don't miss the blackberry,

486
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
vibrating across the floor.

487
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's see.

488
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now,

489
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
it's a brawn call me.

490
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Come on, man.

491
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm in the middle of the show.

492
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You have no respect for the show.

493
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
All right.

494
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let me get to John here and then,

495
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and we'll continue.

496
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hey Adam.

497
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is Dr. John from the Arborxonist podcast,

498
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
coming out of Louisville, Kentucky.

499
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've heard you talk about doing media outlet interviews,

500
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
several times on the source code.

501
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I wanted to send you some feedback and ask you,

502
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
if you had any tips for being interviewed about pod casting.

503
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
See, a reporter from the local newspaper here,

504
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the courier journal has contacted me,

505
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and I'm the first podcaster in our area that he's talked to,

506
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
which makes me both honored and a little bit nervous.

507
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm wondering if there are any techniques that you've come across

508
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
to explain things,

509
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
if there are any sort of pitfalls that you've commonly read into,

510
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
or any other tips or pointers you could give me for sort of

511
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
dealing with the press.

512
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is going to be the first story that has ever run locally.

513
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I want to do my best to get pod casting out there

514
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and push it out to a wider audience.

515
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And so, I figured who better to ask

516
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
than the pod father himself, Mr. Adam Curry.

517
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm also wondering if I could just do a general shout out

518
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to any podcasters or podcas listeners in the Louisville area,

519
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
who might want to be interviewed for the story as well

520
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
because he's looking for lots and lots of folks.

521
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So if you want to contact me,

522
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can put you in touch with the reporter.

523
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
My email address is AVNEST at gmail.com

524
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
or you can go to my website,

525
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
which is www.ardvarksnest.com.

526
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's A-A-R-D-V-A-R-K-S-N-E-S-T.com.

527
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And hopefully we can get some great exposure

528
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
for pod casting and find some new listeners

529
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
for our million listener March.

530
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Thank you.

531
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, I'm on with that, Dr. John.

532
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay, well, this is very difficult.

533
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There's no way I'm going to be able to tell you

534
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
what to expect or how to do it

535
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
because it really comes from doing a lot of interviews

536
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that you learn a lot of tricks.

537
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So let me see if I can give you the top line

538
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
most important ones.

539
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
First of all, you have to really listen to the interview.

540
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Remember, this person is asking you questions,

541
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but their questions will almost always tell you

542
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
what they're, what they have in their head

543
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and what they're already thinking

544
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think every journalist just like every human being

545
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
has an opinion about something.

546
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And it has happened to me so often

547
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that the questions will come in the form of an answer.

548
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So let me give you an example.

549
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Someone might say, so most podcasts are really about

550
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
pod casting still, right?

551
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They're not really about all different kinds of topics.

552
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now, when you get a question like that,

553
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
that's when your antennae should go up,

554
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
way up and go,

555
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because that means that the journalist

556
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
already has made a decision in his or her head.

557
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And it's going to be very, very difficult

558
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
to take them away from that.

559
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So when you hear questions like that,

560
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you almost automatically know what the angle

561
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
of the article is going to be.

562
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And from there, you can start to chip away at it

563
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and you have to be very concise.

564
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And usually just, if the answer is no,

565
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
then you should say no.

566
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No, and let me tell you what it is

567
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
or how it is or the way it is.

568
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I mean, that, that no has to be right up there in front.

569
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's, that's the most important thing

570
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
because journalists really can get stuck

571
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in something that they believe is true

572
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and they're just looking for confirmation.

573
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And I'm not saying that that's bad journalism

574
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
is just my experience.

575
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Now, as it pertains to the 100 million listener

576
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
March, and I think we're probably

577
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
a tenth of the way there.

578
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And please, you can certainly report that number.

579
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The, the most important thing,

580
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
or what I always talk about in interviews

581
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
about podcasting is, look, you know,

582
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
this demand, because that's really what it is.

583
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's listener demand.

584
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Podcasting is being driven by people

585
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
who are sick and tired of listening to the radio.

586
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They're tired of what they're being given.

587
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They're tired of the limited choices.

588
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
They're tired.

589
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's, it's not even up to technical standards

590
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
of, of today's technology.

591
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Look at what we can do.

592
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So, that's what drove podcasting.

593
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I think if you drive that point home

594
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and you can give examples.

595
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You know, we've done that several times here on the source code.

596
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The examples are, you know, you say,

597
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
when's the last time you heard a disjockey on the radio?

598
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Go, I love that fucking song.

599
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm gonna play it every single day till you love it too.

600
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think it's been about 15, 20 years

601
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
since you heard a disjockey talk about a song at all.

602
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So, those are the types of examples.

603
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And that's the type of stuff that I would focus on.

604
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And just beware.

605
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Beware of the questions that you're being asked.

606
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Listen to them carefully and, you know,

607
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and try and process before you answer.

608
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why is this question being asked?

609
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's probably because there's already something set there

610
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that you might have to undo.

611
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Sometimes, of course, you can give out a big yes

612
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and affirm whatever the journalist is thinking

613
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
if you agree with it.

614
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So, that would be kind of my, kind of my advice to you there.

615
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, my goodness.

616
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Let me see.

617
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, I don't have a hit test.

618
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Y'ample that has been very, very busy.

619
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You know, he's setting up this radio school

620
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and he's teaching people how to create radio

621
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and there's a whole podcast in curriculum

622
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and so he's been very busy semini email

623
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and wanted to find this the hit test.

624
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes, John.

625
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Of course, I miss it.

626
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No backtrack podcast today.

627
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But something else came in from a apocalypse doll,

628
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
which will suffice for now.

629
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So Adam, you think you know your hits when they're home?

630
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a homeless.

631
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's see how well you know your hits

632
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
when they're hummed by me.

633
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm popular of style.

634
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is a hum test number one.

635
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay.

636
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's get it started.

637
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Number one.

638
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What was that one?

639
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh, can you figure it out?

640
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Adam, sorry.

641
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay.

642
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's go to the next one.

643
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
All right.

644
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Number two.

645
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I know that one.

646
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
All right.

647
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
How'd you do with that one, Adam Curry?

648
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's like an instrument time.

649
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I like to call it the late 80s.

650
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You bet.

651
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Up next.

652
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's my three and the last one.

653
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
LA guns is what it was.

654
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
All right.

655
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Adam Curry.

656
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
How'd you do?

657
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know.

658
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay.

659
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's see.

660
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The first one.

661
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What is this?

662
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
All right.

663
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Adam Curry.

664
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
How'd you do?

665
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know.

666
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't know.

667
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay.

668
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's see.

669
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The first one.

670
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What is this?

671
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh.

672
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh.

673
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh.

674
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh.

675
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh.

676
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh.

677
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thirty-eight special.

678
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh.

679
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There.

680
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh.

681
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Second Humming.

682
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Bad Humdrop.

683
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Number one.

684
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's.

685
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hold on loosely by thirty-eight special.

686
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's check out the answer to number two.

687
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Mmm.

688
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Uh-oh.

689
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah.

690
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I was right.

691
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Only guns.

692
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Ballet or J?

693
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Baby.

694
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Uh-oh.

695
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Uh-oh.

696
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:44,460
Ah, sorry Adam man. I'm kind of reminiscing here. It takes me back to my freshman year high school

697
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,900
That's LA guns with the bow to Jane. I got one up next the answer number three

698
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'd be like oh

699
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:40,400
Oh, sorry Adam man. I was into it. How about that by a bit along with? It's a good song, man

700
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,800
So of course, I'd say Duran Duran with Henry like the wolf. All right, how'd you do man?

701
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,200
Wow, you are humdinger or you're humiliated

702
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,600
All right, anyway, this has been a popular style. I'm home. Come over. Number one

703
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
All right

704
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,160
Thank you very much. There's all different variations of the format I guess. All right, you're gonna listen to a piece of potsafe

705
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Is it from Brian bucket?

706
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Just gonna take about four or five minutes. I'm gonna go shake out the dry laundry and put the wet stuff into the dry

707
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,040
I'll be right back. This is let the buggy loose on the daily source code

708
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
I got to get home to the later my bro

709
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I got no time

710
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
It's tight

711
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
But I still get the town to not get so tired

712
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
It's the same old shit, just a jibbing day let the buggy loose

713
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Let the buggy loose

714
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Let the buggy loose today

715
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Let the buggy loose tonight

716
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,600
In a matter of time you feel it all right

717
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Trim up, put down the seeds

718
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
I shed the light on the brand, the day he has stretched my own

719
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
To give us a sign

720
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
I watched the glass right out of my eyes, I hit out

721
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Down on the tail

722
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
No shame and jam and nothing but run out on the road home

723
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Just do the show

724
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600

775
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

776
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,800
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Yeah,

777
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh, yeah, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, I Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Dear God!

778
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,640
music network, music.pacho.com last night told you I had an epiphany.

779
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Jah came to visit me, man.

780
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,640
I could have said God could have said Muhammad and could have said Buddha, but it was

781
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Jah, you have to know, and I know, you've heard the lighter click, so you know

782
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
what my voice is.

783
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
And it ain't tobacco.

784
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
And it ain't tobacco.

785
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
And I did a documentary of Jamaica.

786
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Pool, this will be, let me just think.

787
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm going to say this is about 12 years ago.

788
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Maybe even a little bit longer than that.

789
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
And I fell in love with Jamaica.

790
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I completely fell in love with Jamaica.

791
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,640
And learned a lot about the culture.

792
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,640
The documentary that I did involved a lot of Rastafarai stuff.

793
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
You know, a lot of stuff.

794
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Obviously, you can't go to Jamaica and you can't get into the culture without

795
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,640
hooking up with Bob Marley's mom and going to Hope Road, which is where his house

796
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,640
is now museum and really getting into what Bob Marley represented.

797
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,640
And I've many, many friends in Jamaica.

798
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
And I think since then, we've been on vacation in Jamaica.

799
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
I'm probably 15, 16 times.

800
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
We got a little, we owe deed a little bit on Jamaica.

801
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,640
So we haven't been back in a couple years, but we've been talking about it just recently

802
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
saying, oh, man, we really need to go back to Jamaica.

803
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
We're really, it's so nice and so relaxing.

804
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,640
And when I was doing this documentary, I really did start to believe the whole

805
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,640
idea of the holy herb.

806
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
And it did wonders from me last night, man.

807
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Oh, boy, it all came to me.

808
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
And it just, it just came so fast.

809
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
I got out, I jumped out of bed, started writing stuff down.

810
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
I was almost ready to call people when I realized it, like, you know,

811
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
quarter or two.

812
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,640
So the minute I'm done with the show today, it's off to the office,

813
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
because I got some stuff to share.

814
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,640
And I've been wanting to share the office with you guys.

815
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
I've been thinking about doing a sound seeing tool.

816
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,640
We've really just been so incredibly busy doing the show in the morning.

817
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,640
And you feel like you kind of, you know, behind the game already,

818
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
just because of the time difference and then I'm in the office

819
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
around 11, 11, 30 and, you know, I was like,

820
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,640
half the day's over, you know, got a hurry, got to do stuff.

821
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
So I really haven't had the time to do the,

822
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
to do the sound scene tour I wanted to do.

823
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,640
And I wanted to introduce you to a couple of people who work at Pod Show.

824
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,640
And then Michael Butler sent me an email yesterday.

825
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
We did a job cast a couple of weeks ago.

826
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,640
And job cast is basically us saying, hey, here's the people we're looking for.

827
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
We've hired a number of people through that job cast.

828
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,640
And he created a second job cast much shorter than the first one.

829
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,640
And normally I would just put that up on the weekend as a, you know,

830
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
separately in the daily source code feed.

831
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
So you could get it.

832
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
But as I listened to this one,

833
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,640
it actually is a sound seeing tour of the office and some of the people at Pod Show.

834
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,640
So I figured, I put it in the show today because it's,

835
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,640
yeah, it really gives a good representation of the vibe,

836
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
the feeling.

837
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
And if you're looking for a gig,

838
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
it might be handy.

839
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
So here is job cast number two.

840
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Now let's go over to Michael Butler.

841
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Hi, this is Michael Butler.

842
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
And I'm here with job cast number two.

843
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
I'm at the Pod Show offices with Brian Longus.

844
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
How you doing Brian?

845
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Doing great.

846
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
How are you Michael?

847
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
I'm fine.

848
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Couldn't be better.

849
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
So what's your official title?

850
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
VP of operations.

851
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Vice president.

852
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Okay.

853
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Great.

854
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
You got to promote.

855
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
What would you, I thought you were before director of operations.

856
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Vice president, higher than director.

857
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
Yeah, it is.

858
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
So you got to promote.

859
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
All right.

860
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
So what are we doing on this job cast today?

861
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Well, first we wanted to say, hey, the first job cast,

862
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
we got an unbelievable response.

863
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
We hired a bunch of people, some fantastic talent,

864
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
and we're always looking for more.

865
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,640
So just thanks to everyone who emailed the resumes in.

866
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
We got so many.

867
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
We were flooded for a couple days.

868
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
All we could do was really attend to all the resumes and

869
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
increase that we're coming in.

870
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,640
So at this point, we're looking for even more people.

871
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
And so we wanted to make sure we would let everyone know,

872
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
hey, we are looking at them.

873
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Some people we didn't even get a chance to email back and say,

874
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
thank you for sending it in.

875
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
If don't worry, if you haven't heard from us,

876
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
we have looked at the resume.

877
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Yeah, I got a bunch of emails myself, and I have nothing to do with

878
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
this other than being the host of this job cast.

879
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
I just sent them all your way.

880
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
That's perfect.

881
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Okay.

882
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,640
So those jobs, the ones that you were looking for were kind of

883
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
already filled.

884
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,640
I wouldn't say they were filled, because we're still looking for more people.

885
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,640
We had a couple of great hires, and we're still looking for more

886
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,640
and technology, sales and marketing, finance, many different

887
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
areas and groups.

888
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
All right.

889
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,640
So any specific guys you're looking for, guys or girls you're looking

890
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
for?

891
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Absolutely.

892
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Great question.

893
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
In terms of technology, we're always still looking for those that

894
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,640
have very high level architecture background, even people with

895
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
not just PHP programming, but database.

896
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,640
And then we're also looking for people specific in certain areas.

897
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,640
Those that have it had experience with search technology,

898
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,640
telephony, mobile computing, that sort of thing.

899
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,640
So anyone who has specific experience, we'd be really interested in seeing

900
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,640
their resume and having them send in some more information about themselves.

901
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,640
What's the official job title of these people you're looking for?

902
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Is there an official title?

903
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,640
There's a couple different ones, depending upon the positions.

904
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,640
At the moment, we've also not only got the technology people, but we've got

905
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
sales and marketing, looking for what we call more

906
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,640
supervisors, people who know the web in terms of web advertising.

907
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,640
I should say media, those also in finance and on the site.

908
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
You'll see a particular job description for a controller.

909
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,640
And I saw on the website, I was just messing around on podger.com.

910
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
And it said, you're looking for a web intern.

911
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
What's a web intern?

912
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Actually, the reason we posted that is we're looking for actually a couple

913
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,640
individuals that have a broad range of skills that are willing to

914
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,640
and would enjoy and have that real entrepreneurial background

915
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
and spirit because that's what our company is all about.

916
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,640
We've got really excited talented people here at the rock stars.

917
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,640
If you will and we're looking for what we call a web intern,

918
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
so I couldn't think of a better way to explain it.

919
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,640
But they'll be able to be involved in almost every aspect of our business,

920
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
helping out in many different ways.

921
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
So they do need some programming background.

922
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,640
I mean, like a PHP, my SQL, a Lamp environment,

923
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
but they'll be able to touch and deal with different individuals

924
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
and different groups.

925
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,640
So I'm taking maybe a college kid if you need to.

926
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Absolutely.

927
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,640
In college, recently graduated, someone who's just really even

928
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,640
self taught if they've got that experience that we're looking for.

929
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
That's great.

930
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,640
I'll bet you'll get a ton of response from the college kids.

931
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm sure.

932
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Okay, so anything else?

933
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
No, that's it.

934
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
That's basically, you know, in a nutshell,

935
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,640
we still want to obviously keep people interested,

936
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
keep them setting in the resumes.

937
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
I mean, we know they're interested because we get so many

938
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
on a daily basis of fantastic.

939
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,640
We've almost spent a good, some of us half our day or more

940
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,640
and others just solely doing this because recruiting has been so important for us.

941
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
And you sent it to jobs at podshow.com.

942
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Exactly.

943
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Now the people that you hired, are they in the office right now?

944
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Yeah, actually they're here today and I should say this is our

945
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,640
our temp space before we move into our new space.

946
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
All right, so let's take the microphones.

947
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,640
We'll kind of like do a mini sound seeing tour of the podshow offices here.

948
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
All right.

949
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
So here we got the front desk.

950
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Okay.

951
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,640
And as you walk from front to back, got the mini fridge.

952
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
And this is the bathroom with bathroom.

953
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
The bathroom.

954
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Download is done from.

955
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
And then the main area where everyone sits at the moment.

956
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,640
You can see we're cramp because we're hiring so fast.

957
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,640
And there's Chris McIntyre with the eye dog on his desk.

958
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
We've got Matt Oliver.

959
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Just recently joined us in the last couple of weeks.

960
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Say hello Matt.

961
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Hello.

962
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Actually, here's another individual Kevin who just joined recently.

963
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,640
And is this one of the recent hires from the job cast?

964
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Yep.

965
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
So what's your name?

966
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Kevin.

967
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
Kevin.

968
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
How you doing, Kevin?

969
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,640
What are you doing on this job?

970
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
What's your position?

971
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Software engineers.

972
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Okay.

973
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
You've got anything you can tell us about what you've done.

974
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Or is it all top secret still?

975
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Pretty much top secret.

976
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Right.

977
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Everything Kevin does is top secret.

978
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
Right.

979
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
There you go.

980
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
All right.

981
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,640
We're going to introduce you to the Colleen and some others at the moment there.

982
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Business.

983
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
We're going to top secret meeting.

984
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,640
And actually, as we walk through, we're pretty much to the back of the office.

985
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,640
And now we're back in the very back of the offices.

986
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,640
And Ron Bloom is on the telephone.

987
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,640
We'll see if we can listen in on a Ron Bloom conversation.

988
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,640
We'll find some secret company inside information.

989
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Five.

990
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
So.

991
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Who's that Michael Butler?

992
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
That's me.

993
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
How are you doing?

994
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Well, rock and roll geek entrepreneur.

995
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
That's right.

996
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Ron Bloom.

997
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
The King of Podio.

998
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
The Podio.

999
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
The Podinator.

1000
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
That's right.

1001
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Yeah.

1002
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
At least I'm not the Pod mother.

1003
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Right.

1004
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Right.

1005
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
You're the.

1006
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Let's see.

1007
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Adam's the pod.

1008
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Father.

1009
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
We already went through this.

1010
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
So you would be the.

1011
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Marlon Brando.

1012
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
You're.

1013
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
You got to be hired the Marlon Brando.

1014
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
And the pod.

1015
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
I'm counting on you to work on that branding.

1016
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Marlon Brando of me.

1017
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,640
So we're doing a little sound seeing thing of the of the offices.

1018
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,640
We're talking to a couple of people that were hired from the last job.

1019
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,640
Because we figured maybe we would go to the new offices and show.

1020
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Or let the listeners hear how big the new offices are.

1021
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
How cool.

1022
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
How giant.

1023
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
There you go.

1024
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
I'm conceptually large.

1025
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
It's going to be like an echo chamber.

1026
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
It's going to be so big.

1027
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
It's going to be a car campus.

1028
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
That's right.

1029
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
The Podio campus.

1030
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
And we have some.

1031
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Fountains in the front.

1032
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
What's building are you going to building one?

1033
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Yeah.

1034
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Building one.

1035
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Okay.

1036
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
So we're going to building one of the project.

1037
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
No.

1038
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
We're building 42.

1039
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Which one of the two you're going to?

1040
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
We'll start at the beginning.

1041
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Okay.

1042
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
And we're in annex.

1043
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,640
We're in area 50.

1044
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Something.

1045
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Yeah.

1046
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Yeah.

1047
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Hey.

1048
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
69.

1049
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
We're getting.

1050
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Thank you for your podcast, man.

1051
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Because your your job task helped us get some great people.

1052
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
No.

1053
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Thank you.

1054
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
No.

1055
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Thank you.

1056
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
All right.

1057
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
So we're going to go talk to the new hires.

1058
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
You're working to hear more often now.

1059
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
All right.

1060
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
You're coming in and doing some great stuff with bands and things.

1061
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
All right.

1062
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
Be here.

1063
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
One week, I think.

1064
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
One week.

1065
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
The lower week.

1066
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Cool, man.

1067
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Because, you know, I recommend you for the job.

1068
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
Which is one of the reasons why it took so long for anybody to want you here.

1069
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
I appreciate it.

1070
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Okay.

1071
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
I don't know what I'm going to do here.

1072
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
But I'm going to do it.

1073
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
I guess no.

1074
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Well, you're doing it.

1075
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Whatever it is that you're doing now plus some more stuff that we don't understand.

1076
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
You need a more coffee.

1077
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
There.

1078
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Yeah.

1079
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Which you guys beat me some on the way back.

1080
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
But that's across town.

1081
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Only other campus in there.

1082
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
Yeah.

1083
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
All right.

1084
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I'll be Simon Eisen years.

1085
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Absolutely.

1086
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
And I'll be giving you the same treatment.

1087
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Okay.

1088
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Talk to you later.

1089
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
All right.

1090
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
A little bit of sound seeing tour and job cast.

1091
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Thank you very much.

1092
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Like a fun little rock roll.

1093
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Get show.

1094
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I was cool.

1095
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
That was very cool.

1096
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
That's part of it.

1097
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
I wasn't in it.

1098
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
I love it.

1099
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,640
So while that was playing, I folded up the whites.

1100
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,640
And the darks are now spinning around in the dryer.

1101
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
I have to ten more minutes to go.

1102
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
So just about at the end of the show.

1103
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
When that'll be done.

1104
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
You know what?

1105
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
That was so much talk.

1106
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Let me play some music for you.

1107
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
This is from the Pod Show Music Rewind, which you can find.

1108
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Well, I think we're putting on the homepage actually today of the PodSafe Music Network.

1109
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Music.com.

1110
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,640
This is Marcus Couch puts this together once a week.

1111
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,640
And it is literally an overview of all of the top PodSafe music shows.

1112
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
And one of the songs that they play.

1113
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,640
I forget exactly who show we're going to drop in on, but it will be announced.

1114
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Listen to this.

1115
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,640
And of course, if you want to subscribe to the show, you can find all of that at music.podshow.com at the PodSafe Music Network.

1116
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Music.

1117
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Hey, it's Marcus and we are back to present actually my clip for this episode of Rewind.

1118
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,640
This is the scenes scene portion of the show.

1119
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,640
And today I'm going to feature an artist out of New York City named Queen V.

1120
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
And basically here's how you describe Queen V.

1121
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
It's as if Joan Jett revamped her band.

1122
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Got a little more aggressive with her vocals.

1123
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Abtained an even tougher attitude and took on the militant lyrical style of Pat Benetar.

1124
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,640
And you mix that up with some funk, swish it around and some pure rock guitar licks,

1125
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,640
a dash of punchy drum tracks, and you've got Queen V.

1126
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,640
So now you've heard the bio and it's time to hear the rock of Queen V.

1127
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Music.

1128
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Time to make the scene.

1129
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
16 years of harmony.

1130
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Get around town, your majesty.

1131
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I should've known it twice.

1132
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
It's way too slow.

1133
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Make me try.

1134
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
You know you never thought I was the idea.

1135
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,640
I've got to think it doesn't make it to blow your mind.

1136
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
And I never thought I'd die.

1137
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Come on.

1138
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
It's a play.

1139
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
Come on.

1140
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Come on.

1141
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Come on.

1142
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Come on.

1143
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Come on.

1144
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Come on.

1145
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Come on.

1146
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
Come on.

1147
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
Come on.

1148
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Come on.

1149
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
Come on.

1150
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Come on.

1151
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
Come on.

1152
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
Come on.

1153
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
Come on.

1154
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
Come on.

1155
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Come on.

1156
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
Come on.

1157
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
Come on.

1158
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
Come on.

1159
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Come on.

1160
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Come on.

1161
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
You're falling at our name.

1162
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Like a regular refugee

1163
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I only know your忘記

1164
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Just me and a royalty

1165
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,640
We've got as strong as I'm my pride

1166
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,640
And know you don't care what I just I

1167
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
wanna take and live before I die

1168
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
been a man or...

1169
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Come on.

1170
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Come on.

1171
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
Down like acasting gun.

1172
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1173
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1174
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1175
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1176
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1177
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1178
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1179
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:26,640
I got a little bug in your brain

1180
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:47,640
This is where all you've doubt is out there and you'll sit in ties, and we know you are.

1181
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:56,320
It's hard time to make the sea, got my girls to fight for me, couldn't make sure

1182
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:02,320
But you agree, this is how it's got to be, suck it too slow, make you cry.

1183
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1184
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:21,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1185
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:30,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1186
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:40,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1187
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:51,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1188
00:45:52,320 --> 00:46:07,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1189
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:20,320
You know I don't care what you decide, I want to take it to the beginning, one last time, along, blow your mind.

1190
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:28,320
My goodness, checks with attitude, Queen V, love it from the pod show, music rewind, find that a music dot pod show dot com.

1191
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,320
It may even be a pod show music rewind dot com, well I got to check that.

1192
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Pretty cool, it's an enhanced podcast as well, I just noticed because Megaseg recognizes that and the minute I started it,

1193
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,320
I popped a Queen V, a little picture there and a link and this is a great way to discover music man.

1194
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:52,320
There's no easier way for me as a podcaster, I spend lots of time on what we call PMN pods and music network,

1195
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,320
scouting around listening to new submission stuff that's coming in, and of course checking out what other podcasters are playing.

1196
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Because that really is the validation, you know, once there's a pod cache you like and you've heard some songs on that you'd like,

1197
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:10,320
you just listen, you know, subscribe to the show, listen to it, and you'll eventually discover something that you really like.

1198
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:19,320
It's a kick and ass, I really enjoy that last night. It's not all hard rock and stuff, by the way, it's a really nice mix and thanks to all the,

1199
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,320
all the pod showers who are part of that show, really digging it.

1200
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,320
So I'm going to scurry off to the office, as I said, I had the epiphany, and I think it was the, was it,

1201
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:36,320
yesterday, the day before someone asked me about the, the secretive audition that I've been talking about,

1202
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,320
I actually have to correct that. It's an audition, not an audition, but an audition.

1203
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,320
And we will be talking about that in the source codes to come.

1204
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Tomorrow, of course, will be Friday. I'd really love it if you got anything that is going to be really up tempo and,

1205
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,320
and fun and wacky and, you know, anything you got, send it off to me.

1206
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:05,320
Be happy to share that with everybody because we're going to build a little party because it will mean my last show before I go back home.

1207
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,320
I see the girls, it's going to be a lot of fun.

1208
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,320
And, yeah, I think that's it. Let me see if there's a, let me just check my list here.

1209
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,320
We did a Pita, Wilma, stupid Al Roker, wash, yep.

1210
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:25,320
Oh, everything, the whites are full, I'm just waiting for the dark stuff to finish. Oh, yeah, toilet paper.

1211
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,320
Got to steal that from the office.

1212
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Shoot, we did it. Perfect.

1213
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
It's amazing, everybody.

1218
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
I did it.

1219
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,320
Another pod show podcast, stick it in your ear.
