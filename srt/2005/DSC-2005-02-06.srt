1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Daily source code, February 6th, 2005, transmitters, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Autastic, it's Adam Curry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right, Sunday afternoon tied for a laid-back source.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You know, it's like a Sunday, we got to be kind of chilled out.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey everybody, how you doing? Sorry about Friday.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll tell you what went on Friday, why there was no daily source code.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But then again, not too many people seem to mind.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I guess maybe Friday isn't such a big deal if we don't have a show.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Anyway, we're ready for one now.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's Sunday afternoon, it's about three o'clock in the big green horrendous chair.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I noticed when I was talking last time about the big green chair

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that hundreds of people know this chair.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I forgot to mention that this big huge, gaudy recliner was used by lots of the server guys who worked for me.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But I work with it, thinking of ideas, because that's basically when they had to stay overnight or get some work done, they'd chill out in this thing.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And they'd sleep in it, and many a problem has been discussed while someone was sitting in the big green chair.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Trying to just my microphone.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've got the music stand that my father and law made for me.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But it doesn't quite cut it when it comes to the big green thing.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Just a green position at there.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's a little bit better.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alrighty, so Friday.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Even though I posted most of the information to my weblog,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
let's see, what started out Friday?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
After I took her senior to school and all the regular bits, and did my email and check my aggregator and look at all the news and did a couple of postings,

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I went up to Black push airport to get all the info on my FAA fixed wing license add-on.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What a scam that turned out to be, man.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, man, there's just, I love this sensio coffee machine.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Have you ever tried, we've talked about it before on the source code.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It makes such a perfect cup of coffee every single time.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So I went up, to meet with the operations manager.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And if you look at cabair.com, cabair is this flight school that has flight schools at Black Bush and else tree and different airfields around the country.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You know, it's like with the number one guys, we do all FAA training and licensing and examinations.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hold on, that's Brian, I'll have to hold on a second, let me.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is a buddy of mine, hold on a second, hey Brian.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Brian?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm never going to be able to hear him, of course.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, I'll catch him later then.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So the ops manager sat me down and he said, well, you know, about the FAA stuff.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, you know, we really don't have n registered airplanes.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We don't really have anyone to train you.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We have someone who might be moving into L's tree, which is an hour and a half from my house from the cottage.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And maybe you can work some out, but of course you could join in here with our jar ops program and not that hell.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, it's like that means I have to go through a whole bunch of tests all over again and then I'm, you know, I'm then I'm in the European system, which I don't have to be because that's if anything, that's one of the benefits of being a US citizen.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know, having a US passport as you get to do the US FAA flight exams and and just be a part of that system, by the way, the United States did invent flying, you know.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So it's not like we don't know what the fuck we're doing. A lot of Europeans really frown on on the US way of flying and training and again, I think it's just because they like to keep tabs on everybody and.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Europe's you weird right now and and the UK of course is a part of Europe that you know.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But there's the right these referenda or referendums I guess it is that are being held in in the coming year about the European constitution.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've been web logging about the European constitution for a while and it's amazing how few people really give a shit.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I don't even know if most people understand well in the United Kingdom I think they are pretty clued into what's going on, but I know the Netherlands.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
People don't know, you know, and this whole Europe thing this United States of Europe, it started out 25 years ago, I think.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They started planning for this and the whole idea was we're supposed to have a single monetary unit, the EU, the European monetary unit, which now of course is the euro.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And as a part of that we'd have, you know, it's all about economics and now we're seeing that it's not just about economics because, you know, it's about control centralized control from Brussels and not just Brussels, there's also Straussburg.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The European government is home on a second and we just reply to a shoot, I'll get to that Skype message later on.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Actually, I should turn Skype off when I'm recording.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's problematic.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There's a guy here who has, we had a talk show called Kill Roy.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And he became a member of European Parliament just to go and try and blow it up because what he was essentially saying, and there was a great documentary on TV the other day with the man behind the tan.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But you got to envision him a little bit of a kind of like a cross between Haroldo and Jerry Springer, I guess, but he's classy, he's a real classy guy.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
At least he comes across as a classy guy, I don't know him personally.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And it followed him in the European Parliament and he basically was highlighting all these dickhead jibronies who are, you know, making important decisions and casting Britain's vote in European Parliament.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And what we're seeing is that this is not at all about just economics, these fuckers want to make the United States of Europe and they want to control it from Brussels and from Straussburg, like that's the old little mini Washington DC.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And, you know, people should be electing the parliament, you know, I think in most European countries they do elect the European Parliament members, but it's not really being taken that seriously.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I don't think they understand the inhabitants of these countries understand that these people will be making up all the laws and the rules.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And they're basically, you know, they're fat cats, most of them, I'm not going to, you know, I can't just generalize and say all them are fat cats sitting there, you know, with an office in Straussburg and office in Brussels, great traveling expense accounts.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They've got all kinds of secretaries and people to take care of their correspondence and, you know, they just sit there and just pass laws and, you know, and often as is, we see even with the, with the, with the United States, if you look at what bills are passed without people reading them, you know, because they're printed up in the middle of the night with all the changes in them.

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I'm not, I'm not going to try to run off on this tangent, but it has been bothering me that people just really don't seem to understand that there's a snow job going on.

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And I think it's going to be good at all. I'm really against, really, really against all this power that Brussels is pulling towards it, at least from what I've seen so far, the people who are in Brussels are losers.

68
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
These are second line people who couldn't make it in politics, in the, in the, in their own countries in the first place, or maybe they're, you know, they're part of old boys networks.

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And sure there are a few who are really serious about it, kill right, you know, by being an exception defines the rule right there.

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Anyway.

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I love doing the Sunday podcast because I don't feel like I should be limited to 40 minutes and actually I want to catch up on all the stuff that I still have left over from the week that just been pushing off down the outline.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Like, yeah, it's good, but when I run out of time, you know, then of course I make decisions about what I'm going to put in what I'm not going to put in.

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So a couple of things we just got to got to get through the number one thing is it's time for more cowbell.

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is the Chambers Brothers.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Time has come today as the definitive cowbell track for Sunday.

76
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Can't put it off under other day.

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't care what others say.

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They've been with owners in any way.

79
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Time has come today.

80
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

81
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And I don't know if I have to follow, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,Hey, hey, hey,

82
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
Time, I can't run the father's son

83
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,400
A time, a time, a time, a time, a time, a time

84
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,440
Time, I can go and put aside

85
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
Time, I can't run

86
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,440
But I can't make time, time, time, and my soul

87
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
When the cycle tells us, time

88
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
Time, out of time is lost

89
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
Time, there are things to real life

90
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,040
Time, I can't run for days

91
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
Time, out of time is lost

92
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
Time, I can't run

93
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Time, I can't run

94
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,520
Time, I can't run

95
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
Time, I can't run

96
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Time, out of time is lost

97
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,960
Time, out of time is lost

98
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Time, out of time is lost

99
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,840
Time, I can't run

100
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh, now the time has come

101
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
So I know the next you're wrong

102
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
So I don't mind if we're moved by the sun

103
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
But I can't mind what I'm looking for

104
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I've been walking through the side

105
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I've been looking for you

106
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
But I don't mind if I'm coming

107
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Oh, so I know the next you're wrong

108
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I know the time has come

109
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I know all the things you're real on

110
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I've had something to do

111
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
But I don't mind if we're moved by the sun

112
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,760
So I know the next you're wrong

113
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,760
So I know all the things you're real on

114
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I've been looking for you

115
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
But I don't mind if we're moved by the sun

116
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,760
But I don't mind if we're moved by the sun

117
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Yeah, good to the very last drop of Calville

118
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Same as brothers Calville, but they song

119
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
That was a time has come today

120
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Thanks to Greg Del Sesto for sending me that

121
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
And saying indeed this is the

122
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
He says that your listeners Calville

123
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Some issues have been well very cute

124
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
But this is the seminal Calville track

125
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
I think I have to agree

126
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Excellent to listen to that

127
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Much appreciated

128
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Michael Jackson, the big choraldo interview

129
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I guess was last night we recorded it here

130
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Because off of Fox News I haven't seen it yet

131
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Expressly so because I wanted to

132
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
But before I see the choraldo interview

133
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I wanted to just tell you my thoughts

134
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
On what's going on

135
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
With Michael Jackson, essentially what he's saying

136
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
People make shit up

137
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
And it's just not true

138
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
There's even more Skype just keeps on coming

139
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
I need to shut the hold on

140
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Let me just kill Skype for a second

141
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
So that people stop

142
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Instead of messaging me and calling me

143
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
So

144
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
He's saying that he's being framed

145
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Which I totally believe he is

146
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
The question that it's all going to come down to

147
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Essentially is

148
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
It's almost going to be a Clinton thing I think

149
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Although of course, Clinton as we all know now was guilty

150
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
I have a hard time believing Michael Jackson

151
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Is 100% well

152
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I don't think it's as black and white as guilty

153
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Not guilty in this case

154
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
I've met him a couple of times

155
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Every single time I met him

156
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
There were lots of kids

157
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
And how he mandell

158
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Running around

159
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
By the way

160
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Lots of girls too, not just boys

161
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm wondering where all the girls are

162
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,760
In all these stories that I'm seeing on Fox and CNN

163
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
And web logs and everyone's reporting on it

164
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,760
And it's amazing how big this story is

165
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,760
And of course, it's quite normal for people to

166
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
And people like you and I

167
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
To

168
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
How can I explain it

169
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
When there's a celebrity who makes lots of money

170
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
And everything's going their way

171
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
And especially if they're a little bit of eccentric

172
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
It's just fun, it makes you feel good

173
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
When they fuck up and they get hammered down

174
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
You know, it's like that

175
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Guy has problems just like me

176
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
And I've been there, not at a Michael Jackson level

177
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
By any, by any means

178
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
But I've certainly been there

179
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
I've been on covers of newspapers and

180
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
In other words, falsely accused of

181
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Cheating on taxes and

182
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
All kinds of horrendous things

183
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Nothing as bad

184
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Really as what Michael Jackson's being accused of

185
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
But I think this guy

186
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Is truly just a really loving guy

187
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
And he likes to hang out with kids

188
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
And hug them

189
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
And cuddle with them

190
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
And play with them

191
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
And that is something that in the United States

192
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Unless it's your own children

193
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Is just not acceptable

194
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
It's not accepted

195
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,760
And European listeners I think

196
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Will understand when I say

197
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
And lots of American listeners of course

198
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
You know, this is in some ways

199
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Along the line of the Janet Jackson

200
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Nipple gate controversy

201
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
You know, big fucking deal

202
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
We were laughing last night

203
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
We were watching this reality show

204
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Called the casino, it's about the golden nugget

205
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Casino

206
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
And I'll let me just

207
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Reset my latency here

208
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
That sounds actually pretty sexual

209
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Reset my latency

210
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
And we were laughing about the show

211
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Because it's a US reality-based show

212
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,760
And in this you see

213
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,760
You see strippers, you see gambling, drinking, drunk people fighting

214
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
You know, just everything that is Las Vegas

215
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
And then on certain point there

216
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
These group of girls who have a batslet party

217
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
And they're walking around with an inflatable penis

218
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Near the pool

219
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
And they have to blur this whole thing out

220
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Like this is going to damage me

221
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
If I see an inflatable six foot tall

222
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
And inflatable penis

223
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
On the screen, you know, meanwhile

224
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
In America

225
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Most people I know

226
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
And I'm an American myself

227
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
We're always thinking about dick

228
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
And how to get it sucked

229
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Actually

230
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Let's just call it spades

231
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
That's what everyone's thinking all the time

232
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
But oh God

233
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Oh God

234
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
And that's something to do with God

235
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
And God fearing people perhaps

236
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
You know, let's not show that on television

237
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
Oh corrupt the minds of our children

238
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Um

239
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
So in a way Michael

240
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I think is a victim of his success

241
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
He's a victim of his corkiness

242
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Which is lots of creative people are quirky

243
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
And weird and funky

244
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
And you know, excuse me

245
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
If you could please give me a definition of what is normal

246
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Then we could all adhere to it

247
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
On the other hand

248
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I also have to say that when

249
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
When folks say, oh, you know that

250
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Like we have a secret

251
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
And we'll put it in this little box

252
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
And we don't tell anyone about it

253
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
That those are like the

254
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
The classic pedophile moves

255
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
And I don't know what's true

256
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
You know, that's another thing

257
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
What's true?

258
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
What is the real truth

259
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
And

260
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Yeah

261
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I

262
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Until I see some really compelling proof

263
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
And when I see these kids, you know, all I see is that they're

264
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
They're cuddling with them

265
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
And many people that just may make them nauseous

266
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
You know, to see a grown man cuddled with

267
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
With a child, particularly of the same sex

268
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,760
But I'm sorry

269
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
I just as I know Michael Jackson

270
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I do not believe

271
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
He is a pedophile

272
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
I think he really

273
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Truly

274
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Loves children

275
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Loves having them around

276
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Loves cuddling and hugging with them

277
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
And there's nothing wrong with that

278
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
There really isn't

279
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
And when we were in

280
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Is something I don't think

281
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,760
I don't think I've actually ever told anyone this on the podcast

282
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,760
In 1999

283
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I was just about done with

284
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
My tenure at the company

285
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Ron Bloom and I took public

286
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Think new ideas

287
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,760
And we had promised to a three year contract

288
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
And I was, you know, Ron stayed on longer

289
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
To actually merge with another company

290
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
And he did a great job with that

291
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
But I had to go

292
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
I was like I was done

293
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I was toast three years of running Ron and suit

294
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Was too much for me

295
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
And

296
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,760
But we really wanted to leave the states at that moment

297
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
And the catalyst for that

298
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Was about a year prior to that

299
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
One of the mothers

300
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Of the school that Christina was going to

301
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Came over to our house

302
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Knocked on the door

303
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
And I opened up

304
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
And Patricia was there

305
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
And she said well

306
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
And I really have to talk to you about something

307
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Because all the mothers at the school

308
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
We had a conversation

309
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
And we feel that Patricia

310
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
You should wear baggier clothing

311
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
When you come to school

312
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
And Patricia's hot

313
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
She's sexy

314
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
She wears

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Like a

316
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Like a

317
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
A track suit

318
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
And she looks hot

319
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Like J.Glo

320
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
J.L.

321
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Whereas a track suit

322
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Only Patricia's a bud egg

323
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
That big

324
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I think goodness

325
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
You know, Patricia is

326
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
She's curvy

327
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
She's crevacious

328
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
She's sexy

329
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
She's beautiful

330
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
She's a beautiful woman

331
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Which of course

332
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
I think part of the problem here

333
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Maybe a bit of jealousy

334
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
But to then say

335
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
You have to wear bagier clothing

336
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Because the boys are at that age

337
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
And they're looking

338
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Like what the fuck

339
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Is that all about

340
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
And that really

341
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
You know, set us off

342
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
And I have to say that

343
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I would say to Christina

344
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
When she was young

345
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
You know, maybe like four or five

346
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
And we take a bath together

347
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Or sometimes she's hopping the shower

348
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Or whatever

349
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
And I said don't tell anyone

350
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
It's cool

351
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Because they won't understand

352
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
And I truly believe that

353
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
And boy was I right

354
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
When after that episode

355
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
With that mother

356
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
And we said

357
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
We looked at each other and said

358
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Fuck this

359
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Let's get the hell out of here

360
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
For a while

361
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
I can't deal with this

362
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
And of course that may be something to do with

363
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Suburban New Jersey

364
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Where we live

365
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
But you know

366
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Is it any different anywhere else?

367
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
So there's

368
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
There is

369
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Some frustration

370
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Particularly in the United States

371
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Fed by the media

372
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Even though we all love having sex

373
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
You know that

374
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
You're listening to this thinking right now

375
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Like yeah, I love having sex

376
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Yeah, we all think about dick

377
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Whether you have one or one

378
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Or need one

379
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
So I hope

380
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
My true hope is that Michael Jackson

381
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Really does get a fair trial

382
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
I'll be the first one to say

383
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I really misread it

384
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
And I've misread people before

385
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
And let me tell you

386
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Big time

387
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
So it wouldn't be the first time

388
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
But if anything

389
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
I believe Michael Jackson is asexual

390
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Just he has no sex whatsoever

391
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
And look at the guys

392
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Look at his childhood

393
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I don't believe he was abused as a child

394
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,760
So I don't think that

395
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
That would have any influence on

396
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
I just I cannot see it

397
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
The way I know what I've seen

398
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
And I've seen a little bit more

399
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Than what you're seeing on television

400
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
So I'm going to watch the Haraldo thing now

401
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
I think that he's pretty much

402
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Sticking up for Jackson

403
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
That's what I read somewhere

404
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
But I want to see the

405
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
The interview first

406
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
To see what his conclusion was

407
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Haraldo's a lawyer

408
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
So hopefully he's looking at the evidence

409
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
On hand

410
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
And is making a qualified decision

411
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Based upon that

412
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
And it's interesting though

413
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Now you see Michael Jackson is really

414
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,760
He's really starting to talk straight

415
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
There was a time when

416
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I only could do talk like this

417
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
And I'm really just

418
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm really just very shy

419
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
And part of that's an act

420
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Perhaps part of his creative process that he goes through

421
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
But he's talking pretty clearly now

422
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
And he wants his day in court

423
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
And he has great faith in the American people

424
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Has great faith in our justice system

425
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
So do I

426
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,760
And so I totally hope that he gets a fair shake

427
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
And then after that

428
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
We should try and leave him alone

429
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
And just think also

430
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Because this could happen to you

431
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
If it could happen to Michael Jackson

432
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
It could happen to you

433
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
And it happens all the time

434
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Okay

435
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Enough about Mike

436
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
By the way, no matter what you say

437
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
He is one talented mother fucker

438
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I've been getting a lot of comments about

439
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Embedding show notes

440
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Into the MP3 file

441
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
And let me say I got a couple here

442
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I haven't reviewed them

443
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Here's

444
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh yeah, this is a great link that I got from

445
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Dan Carlene

446
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
There's a caption editor

447
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,760
On iriveramerica.com

448
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
The link of course in the show notes for today

449
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Where you can drop your MP3 file in

450
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,760
And then you cop you paste your show notes into the text window

451
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
And then you start the MP3 player

452
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,760
And let's say your show notes are just one line above another

453
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Right

454
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
And you can time it

455
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
You can say okay I want

456
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
So for instance right now

457
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
I'd be talking about the iriver show notes

458
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
And you'd look at your iriver

459
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
And across the screen would be

460
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Perhaps the email from Dan

461
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
That would be streaming as a text scroll

462
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
And it works this actually works on

463
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
A number of different players

464
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Of course not on the iPod

465
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Nor as far as I can tell this work in iTunes

466
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Or maybe a plugin to actually show

467
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,760
The notes because this is a part of the

468
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Lyrics tag in the ID3 tags

469
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Not amazing how everything about MP3 and ID3

470
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Is all based on music and nothing generic

471
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
They really weren't thinking about

472
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Anything other than

473
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,760
The music when all this was put together

474
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Let's see what the next email was

475
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Oh this is from Tom Scuding

476
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
He has some more technical information

477
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
He says the old synchronized lyrics

478
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Standard S-Y-L-T frame

479
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
In the ID3 tags

480
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
In beds of file into ID3 tags

481
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
So it's included in the MP3

482
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
So you need to add an extra file

483
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
So there's no syncing problem

484
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
And again, what he's saying is

485
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
The biggest problem is there is no

486
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
There are almost no tools to create this stuff

487
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
With

488
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Because doing it by hand

489
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
I mean that's going to be a nightmare

490
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
But I think what we want is

491
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Just like that I river thing

492
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Although it's windows

493
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
And it didn't work very well for me

494
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
And it would be a horrendous process

495
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
To add to the chain of things

496
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
That I have to do to get my podcast out

497
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Obviously

498
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
But if there was an easy way to do it

499
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Boy what I

500
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
And then all of our ran

501
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Actually sent an email about

502
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
How this works

503
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,760
How the lyrics tags work

504
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
How you can encode them

505
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
So there is a lot of data about this

506
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
And there's just almost no tools

507
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
On the Mac there's certainly no tools

508
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Whatever there's plenty of tools

509
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,760
For windows

510
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
And for doing stuff

511
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Like Winamp

512
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
And there's a lot of stuff there

513
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
But I'd like to hear more

514
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
If you know of an editor that will work on the Mac

515
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,760
So I can start testing some of that stuff

516
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
And if we know how we can make

517
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Lyric show up on the iPod

518
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
That we may as to get somewhere with these show notes

519
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
It could be pretty cool

520
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
See when I get here

521
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
This is from

522
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
This is from Kim

523
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Of Shakespeare's Two Flay

524
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
And Home School Habitat

525
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,760
I played a bit of their weblog before

526
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Their podcast before

527
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
There was some tool

528
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Anyway, I'm stuck at home

529
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
When the flute today

530
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I've been ego surfing on lines

531
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
My podcast is listed found in the link

532
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Have you ever wondered

533
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
As Kim

534
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Where all the lady podcasters are

535
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Goes on to say I guess

536
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Match counts

537
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
But really there are a ton of us out there

538
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Amy over the blog content

539
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Contentious

540
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Has done us all the way

541
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
By compiling a list

542
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
So check that link

543
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
Out the women in pod casting

544
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
The definitive list

545
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
And let's add to that

546
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I just see podcasters

547
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Podcasters is podcasters

548
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I don't see them really

549
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Is you know, male or female

550
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
And we have

551
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
What is open source sex

552
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Violet blue

553
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
And

554
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Well

555
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Let's just call them all Bitty

556
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Shall we?

557
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Which segway is beautifully

558
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Into this track that I received

559
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
From

560
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Bitty Lyann

561
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
When I say Bitty Lyann

562
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Of course I'm talking about Lyann

563
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
From the

564
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Lassidious Bitties

565
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
She came across a track

566
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Which is absolutely

567
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Larious

568
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
Certainly in the context of

569
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Seeing the Bitties on the 16th of February

570
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
When I go to New York

571
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
They they

572
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Check this one out

573
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
On the swiss

574
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
I see Bitties

575
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Here they're everywhere

576
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Browns go it's grey here

577
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Trouble when they walk here

578
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
It's a Friday set of streets

579
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
A full of old gears on day release

580
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
You're not able to walk fast

581
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
But you talk fast

582
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Body shape like a B glass

583
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
At the road crossing

584
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
So slow

585
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
When the lights go

586
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Not even up the curb zone

587
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
This is my first

588
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I slow back

589
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Nice old lady and her best hat

590
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I know you can't see me

591
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Because you left the glasses

592
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
And off with the TV

593
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Then you reach out

594
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
And touch my face

595
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
And say

596
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
There were one that came back

597
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
To your place

598
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
I would put the only button

599
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
For as I see

600
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
You're the I'm 18

601
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
You're 73

602
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Oh

603
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,760
You know I see a lot

604
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I'm not holding on

605
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,760
To be giving you babies

606
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Oh

607
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
You know I see a lot

608
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,760
But I'm not holding on

609
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
To be giving you babies

610
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
I see babies

611
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
When I'm cruising in my box all over

612
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
When I'm cruising I got pulled over

613
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Knit my jumper

614
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
No she's over

615
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
It's rude to dump her

616
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Come with down the shots for some Benson

617
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Down the post office for your pension

618
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Into a little woods for a cup of tea

619
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
And a bit of touch

620
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
And at the launch of really

621
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
W8 speech lickin it's like

622
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
And the doctor replace it hits like

623
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
In will work

624
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
Shake it all around the floor

625
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Till you forget what you came in for

626
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
You got your own home when you always eat out

627
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
But that doesn't mean that I don't get freaked out

628
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,760
See I don't have a problem with you calling me king

629
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
But I do have a problem with you having no tea

630
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Oh

631
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
You know I see a lot

632
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
I'm not holding on

633
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,760
To be giving you babies

634
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Oh

635
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
You know I see a lot

636
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
But I'm not holding on

637
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,760
To be giving you babies

638
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,760
You know I see a lot

639
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,760
But I do have a problem with you

640
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
So I'm not holding on

641
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
To be giving you babies

642
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Oh

643
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
You know I see a lot

644
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm not holding on

645
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:09,760
To be giving you babies

646
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,000
You know what I see in love

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,320
But I'm not old enough

648
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,360
To be giving you babies

649
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,720
Oh, oh, oh

650
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
You know what I see in love

651
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
I'm not old enough

652
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,080
To be giving you babies

653
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,520
Oh, oh

654
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,680
You know what I see in love

655
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,000
But I'm not old enough

656
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
To be giving you babies

657
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Seeing nothing but babies

658
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Wanting my babies

659
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
I'm living a baby's dream

660
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
You know what I mean

661
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
It's not right

662
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
It's not love

663
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Oh

664
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
It's not good

665
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Oh

666
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,440
So in the States there's 50 cents here in the UK. It's 50 pence. I see bitties on the daily source code

667
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,880
Today's Sunday. It's February 6, 2005

668
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,200
Then I said it was going to be seeing the bitties to the 16th of February. I am

669
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,040
Booking my trip. You know, I've met so many people so many old voices from the past have come up

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Since the podcast in craze really has grown too much of big hype

671
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm just getting emails from people I've been spoken to in a long long time and I just need to do a little trip

672
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,600
So the idea is that I will be in New York on the 16th for the bitties

673
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,080
Bittie cast the kickoff there

674
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
I really want to be want to be there when that happened

675
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm going to meet a couple people like Steve Leeds when I told you about him from from the MTV days

676
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,240
My old buddies from Medi America Jones, Medi America who did my radio syndication

677
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,800
They're all over podcasting of course have questions

678
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Then I was going to travel out west

679
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
Guy who worked at Microsoft in the Netherlands eric hookers

680
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,560
About five years ago. I met him when I was into the jamvy stuff doing all of the

681
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,920
Why actually trying to I guess do a version of of

682
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,240
podcasting only it was with video it was a Java and without artists and guess what didn't work

683
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
He is now

684
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,520
He just moved from Rome with his family to Seattle to become he's some big marketing mark now

685
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
Microsoft and

686
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,120
He's heading up the what group is it something with the Windows media. I'm sure and

687
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
So he's invited me to come out and

688
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
And I've known him for for a couple years so be kind of cool. It's like local boy makes good

689
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,200
You know now he's a big cheese at Microsoft so be happy to go over there and

690
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,920
Oh, maybe I'll get to sit in a windowless room with him

691
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,800
Which is what happened the last time I went to Microsoft

692
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,120
Then there's some people in San Francisco of course that I want to hook up with and with any lock

693
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,680
And this is what I'm trying to figure out I'd like to go to the rave awards

694
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Of course have been nominated for iPodder

695
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,800
And that I think is on the is at the eight knows the 22nd I believe so

696
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,600
And then I'll probably go back from either there or from Seattle and not quite sure and I'm trying to hook up with

697
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,040
Don and Drew

698
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,600
I know they go out to San Francisco a lot so I'm trying to coordinate that and just you know

699
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Steve Gilmore just

700
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,600
Lots of people lots of people to hang out with and talk with and see where we're at as as we move podcasting forward and

701
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,080
You know I do want to say about podcasting that because who sent me I got an email yesterday

702
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,200
So I'm saying hey, you know we could also attach you know I call invitations to RSS feeds

703
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,800
It's an apps of fucking lootably

704
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,320
You know and just because it's an MP3 file that's attached to an RSS as an enclosure doesn't mean it has to be

705
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
You know start with a show opener and have

706
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,480
You know all kinds of stuff in the middle it could be anything you want like what have been listening to recently

707
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,480
Surelock homes has been coming through and a little bit every single day. That's one of the podcast

708
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm subscribed to if you want to see new podcasts that are updated regularly I potted out org

709
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,800
Has all the new podcast listed every single day. There's probably about 10 new submissions a day on average that come in and of course there's the whole directory

710
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
If you want to

711
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,160
Have your podcast listed in the directory a lot of people are looking for this

712
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,720
And I guess it's just not clear on the site itself going to the directory go to a node that you think your podcast would would fit and

713
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,160
On that page you'll see a submit a link

714
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,600
link you click on that and you should be your information it goes off to the maintainer of that node and then

715
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,680
It will be added into the directory also slim that down a bit the directory because it was getting a little bit

716
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,720
large to suck into some of the iPodder software like iPodder itself the lemon version

717
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,360
It was it grown to like 250 k and size and I shrunk that down to like 70 now by

718
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,640
Aggregating some stuff putting it into its own

719
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:18,560
Opml file which is a great way. I guess to kind of cut down on on the on the bandwidth and just sucking in the that that that that file which has gotten a little bit large in size and

720
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,840
The lemon guys said that the improvement is really good and as you know they're working on the 2.0 release of lemon

721
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,120
So I'm really excited to see what's going on there. There was a was a PC magazine review of that also of Doppler radio

722
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,680
So a review of that fine Dutch iPodder client so

723
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Good stuff there. Let me see

724
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,400
Some more stuff we got to clear up remember I was talking about reality shows about the

725
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,640
Anatomy for beginners and then I came up with this luminous idea of

726
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:55,360
Doing a stop smoking reality show that it could only be moments away. Well, I got two emails again all this that in the in the show notes

727
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:02,160
This show already existed. It's already done. It was called cold turkey where celebrities tried to get quit smoking

728
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Information about that as I said in the show notes

729
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:11,600
What's the second email I got from Todd yeah same thing packs tv pax tv dot com

730
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,320
Cold turkey and then there's also a link to the website for anatomy for beginners Mike which I have dubbed now anatomy for dummies

731
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,960
Well, what a great show that is I've also subscribed to the some new podcasts

732
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,080
One of them is the indie media feed

733
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,240
Indie media I've already you know been paying attention to what they've been doing for a long time

734
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,200
It's you've got some great websites great infrastructure

735
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,960
Different countries have you know the indie media dot org it really propagates out even the Netherlands has their own indie media

736
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,280
So now there's all these well not necessarily

737
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,880
Specific podcasts, but I think some of them are being made specifically as podcasts, but I guess there was already a lot of

738
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,840
Audio activism going on for instance audio activism.org. I found

739
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,680
This and I don't think it's a separate feed for it comes to on my indie media subscription jodie pulse and

740
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,680
Does these

741
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,440
Wonderful little stories and we see how long is this one this one is

742
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Three minutes

743
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,600
Yeah, I want to play the whole thing for you actually because I was amazed even though I think I knew most of the information about the fed

744
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Now you've probably heard this you know the fed the fed is

745
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
Basically Alan Greenspan and he you know talks about

746
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,720
You know the economy and where it's going and inflation, but also he determines if there's going to be why don't

747
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,920
Of heat determines he announces the the interest rate hikes or drops, et cetera and

748
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,520
It's really all has to do with central banking and

749
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,160
I don't know too much about it. I'm sure that there's some financial people out there who would be happy to jump in on the

750
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Conversation and talk to us about central banking

751
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,040
But listen to this story. I'm going to play the whole thing. It's three and a half minutes if you want to fast forward

752
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,080
You can but I think it'll be very interesting to you to find out exactly what the fed is

753
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,840
Who's a member who controls them and what they do?

754
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,400
Hi, this is jodie paulson from Moscow, Idaho with what they don't tell you

755
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,160
Unlike general Tommy Franks who feels there exists quote the potential of a massive

756
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,600
casualty producing event somewhere in the western world that causes our population to question our own

757
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,960
Constitution on quote I feel the US Constitution is an extremely hardy document loaded with foresight

758
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
Unfortunately in 1913

759
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,480
Congress trashed that foresight and ignored Thomas Jefferson who said quote if the American people ever

760
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation and then my deflation

761
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,000
The banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property and tell their

762
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,080
Children will wake up homeless on the continent their father's conquered unquote

763
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:59,440
Ignoring clause five of section eight of the Constitution Congress sold out its power to coin money and regulate its value to a group of private

764
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
Bankers by creating the federal reserve

765
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,720
What the fed isn't of public institution. It's a bunch of private banks

766
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,000
That's right. It's not owned by the federal government or the taxpayers of the United States

767
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,480
In fact, you could say they own us because we're in debt to them up to our eyeballs

768
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,160
The fed consists of Rothschild Bank of London Warburg Bank of Hamburg Rothschild Bank of Berlin

769
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
Laman brothers of New York

770
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,760
Lazzard brothers of Paris Koon low bank of New York is real Moses sife banks of Italy

771
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,960
Goldman Sachs of New York Chase Manhattan Bank of New York and Warburg Bank of Amsterdam

772
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
These guys print and led your money out of nothing and loan it back to us with interest

773
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Obviously, we'll never be able to repay them in Dan Benham's brilliant article a phone call to the fed

774
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,840
We discover there are only 263 billion federal reserve notes in circulation

775
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,360
But we have a four trillion dollar national debt payable in federal reserve notes

776
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,120
How do you like them apples?

777
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,760
Congressman Ron Paul says quote most Americans have suffered a steadily eroding purchasing power

778
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,200
Because of the federal reserves inflationary policies

779
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,240
This represents a real if hidden tax imposed on the American people on quote

780
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Here are some statistics to back that claim in 2001

781
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,360
$1,780 had the same purchase power as a hundred dollars in the year 1913

782
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
In 1913 a hundred and thirteen dollars had the same purchase power as a hundred dollars in 1776

783
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Get the feeling we're being scammed

784
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,600
Maybe it wouldn't surprise you to know that Enron's infamous Jeff Skilling was director of the federal reserve bank in Houston

785
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,440
So anyway whenever the government runs a deficit the fed prints money to buy the debt and

786
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,280
40% of our income taxes pay the interest

787
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,160
Keep in mind the fed's books are not

788
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,760
Opens the public these guys possess almost unlimited resources to buy influence and power

789
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,800
Presidents Jackson Lincoln and Kennedy tried to rest control of this country away from the bankers by printing

790
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,760
US dollars without charging taxpayers interest

791
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,600
But as you can imagine messing with the bankers can often be a dangerous move

792
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm Jodie Paulson and I just thought you should know

793
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,120
Well, I think that should be a podcast all by itself what they don't tell you Jodie Paulson excellent stuff

794
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,880
I opening stuff and I wish I fully understood what was going on

795
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,560
But sounds like we're getting

796
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,880
Sold a whole bunch crap by whole bunch bankers including some other focus from Amsterdam the warberg bank of Amsterdam

797
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,040
And also interesting to hear that even Kennedy tried to wrestle that away from the bankers and

798
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,000
Printed money without charging the taxpayers. I mean

799
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,120
It's some pretty heavy and heavy stuff

800
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,120
So if you've got an opinion on that of course, this is only one side of the story. I'm sure

801
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,600
There's probably lots of wonderful things that central banking is brought to us, but it sounds kind of weird

802
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,040
You know if that really isn't the constitution it says that that can't happen then I quite sure how it happened

803
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,000
You know that again lots of weird things happen look at a rack

804
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:23,040
So we're now at our 40-minute threshold. I'm just gonna keep going because I'm about three quarters of the way through my list

805
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,040
And I just want to get everything done. Maybe I'll play a whole bunch of promos one after another

806
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,320
That I've been saving up and just haven't had time to get to

807
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,440
I've also continued to maintain sound seeing tours dot com if you go to that site that is actually a feed burner

808
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
RSS feed so you'll see like

809
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,680
The listing of the sound seeing tours and whole bunch of other crap on the page

810
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Really just want to stick that into your aggregator or your iPod or soundseeing tours dot com and and it should bring up

811
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,320
It should bring up the the sound seeing tour feed I've been adding to to this feed

812
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,360
Really with only the best stuff that I've got in fact I just added bicycle marks tour of the red light district and absolutely hilarious

813
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
But there's a beautiful sound seeing tour

814
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,280
combo

815
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:21,040
Called on the wing and it's a husband. I think it's husband and wife and they go around different to a parts of the UK and do some sound seeing

816
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,040
I just want to play a little bit of this Kent ponds sound sound seeing tour because they did something really nice

817
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,800
They split up the audio channels left and right and

818
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:41,120
The quality is just a step David Dawson with on the wing my wife Gail and I recently visited the green river natural resources area south of Seattle better known as Kent ponds

819
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,520
Great to hear it up there. I know how does that sound

820
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
It's

821
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,120
It's Sunday, January 30th

822
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,880
2005

823
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
We're at Kent ponds

824
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,400
Is something a raptor flying low a raptor

825
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,640
Wait a raptor? Are they in Jurassic Park on the street now? We're just walking down that

826
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,000
So anyway, that's you can find that it's sound seeing tours.com, but you got the idea right it's really intimate

827
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,360
It's left and right and it really trips with your brain when you're listening to that on the on the iPod

828
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Or your MP3 headphones a little ear buds

829
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,240
more

830
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
information about

831
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
My blind typing quest

832
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,280
Let's see Andrew says tape a

833
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,480
She to paper along the top of the keyboard drape it over your hands

834
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,560
See that that apparently works. I've been trying several of the

835
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm getting better. I find that just forcing myself to look at the screen my fingers pretty much know where all the keys are

836
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:51,440
But you know, I still occasionally hit the X instead of the C and stuff like that and of course said the T instead of the Y because I've got like

837
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,360
Uncoordinated fingers and

838
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:02,240
Here you go shopman who we've spoken about many times before who is one of the pioneers in coming up with audio routing to record podcasts on the Mac

839
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
for an audio recording console

840
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,920
Has has really done it again. He's come up with a way. You know, I was complaining about being able to

841
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,960
Set up my microphone with a chain of effects and then separately set up

842
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,400
Audio tracks with a chain of effects. Well, yeah, you go did it again. I actually have to open this

843
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,520
This I haven't opened all of these files yet. Let me see if I can get to his oh here he is here's Hugo's

844
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
hijack set up message

845
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Adam

846
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,080
This is who close up mum or you go shopping you go shopping you're speaking people

847
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,720
I have to whisper a bit because there's somebody sleeping in the next room

848
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,880
All right

849
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,320
a comment about the use of audio hijack pro

850
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,240
I've been playing around with that a little bit and

851
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
testing latency and

852
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
getting into all kinds of details

853
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,960
Which I'm intending to write up on my website

854
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,480
log.yugoshotman.com

855
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,240
I'm not using the

856
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,880
Voice over effect that you're using or that you described in your last podcast

857
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:20,000
I have a different set up and I've actually described it on my site and also in the test recording that I

858
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,520
I'm sending you the link to and I will also put the link on the website

859
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,480
Um, I can totally help you out with

860
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:37,840
In conjunction with the guys at a rogue or me, but if you want because I've been doing all kinds of

861
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
pretty technical tests and

862
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,040
So let me know and

863
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Keep up to good work

864
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,880
Now Hugo, thank you you keep up the good work he's been in this conversation it's been ongoing

865
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,240
Dawn and Drew were in it. I'm in it. I think oh Michael gohagan is in it

866
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,680
Why man let me just check that because there's an email he only see who else was copied

867
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,680
Oh Dave Slushart right. I'm sorry. Now we could copy Michael on it

868
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,200
Anyway, it's a big a big Mac community using audio hijack pro and we're now talking to one of the

869
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,320
Creators of the of the software

870
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:18,160
Quentin and Hugo is really leading this charge it being a great guide through all the technical stuff

871
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,760
So that we could really start to explain what we're looking for and I think we're making headway

872
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,960
Because I really do love this company. I think they're making some great software

873
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:31,280
I use it every single day and just want to be able to use it in even better ways that are more suited towards the way I create a podcast

874
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,000
Which of course is by no means set in law as the definitive way to do it

875
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,120
So I'll keep keep you posted on that if you want all the details of Hugo set up

876
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,320
You can find that in the show notes at daily source code dot com

877
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,520
Hello Adam and all the daily source code listeners. This is John on from online podcast and yes online is spelled

878
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,200
oh and g

879
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,720
L i any

880
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,560
I like to wish you Adam and all the daily source code listeners are very prosperous and happy Chinese new year

881
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,560
The year of the rooster

882
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,400
Especially if you're Chinese or if you're celebrating the luda calendar new year

883
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,200
Go with tikton大家好

884
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,800
Siwang Jingjidian

885
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
He will eat a lot of how you

886
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,440
Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

887
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,560
You know you know that what he's doing right now is saying Adam carries an incredible dickhead in Chinese or Mandarin

888
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,280
You know that that's not just saying happy new year

889
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,240
Go hit that toy

890
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,000
Dike Dile

891
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,640
So if you understood me any of the languages above English included

892
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,600
You are qualified to listen to my show. So go over to online dot john on dot com and check out my podcast

893
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,760
And that's ong li and e dot jho and g dot com

894
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,600
Thanks again Adam for being the source of inspiration and motivation for me to start my own show

895
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,480
By the way, I'm addicted to your daily source code

896
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,280
It's yeah, and that's see you in that breed. Bye. I want some boy or ong and Mandarin

897
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,640
Actually, thank you very much. What do they mention there's a brand new

898
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,960
Indy feed podcast feed for punk punk music and of course

899
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,520
That is listed in the show notes as well and it's on ipod.org the definitive

900
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,640
Resource for you to go and find all of your new podcasts

901
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,080
I had them. This is Rob from podcast 411

902
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,360
I do a podcast why interview other podcasters

903
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,360
Each show I pick one podcast and we interview the people that are involved with that podcast

904
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:53,600
To find out a little bit about what they learn doing podcasts some technical information their history of computers and then about their podcast in general

905
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,040
I think you'll really enjoy the show some recent interviews

906
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,440
Ken and Cindy from the Ken and squip show Chris from the daily download

907
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,960
CC Chapman from reality bitch lab radio and from eat feed and many others

908
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:15,040
So check it out www dot podcast 411 dot com and remember to listen different all right listen different

909
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,720
Ooh and a slogan like that the satellite bandwidth continued

910
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Rob Frieden

911
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,480
Who is actually I we've talked about him Penn St. University he pioneers chair and

912
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,880
He's the pioneers chair and professor of telecommunications god. I love having these people listen to the show

913
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,680
Makes me feel so incredibly smart

914
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,280
Thanks for mention my email response your questions about satellite capacity as your questions about digital audio satellite

915
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,760
Examine series channel bit rates here some links of course those provided in the email that I posted

916
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,680
Also an economist article about it, but the unconfirmed view yet is that as so far as that each channel uses

917
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,280
16 to 32 kilobits per second, which is nothing

918
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,560
And I think that's I guess the 16 kbps is and we went its mono probably in 32 if they're doing stereo

919
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,760
But that is nothing man, so I think it's the AAC compression that they're using

920
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,680
Now of course it's not what was widely adopted as MP3, but there's some real validity to this format

921
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
That we should be looking into

922
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,960
And I wonder

923
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,000
What popular MP3 players do not

924
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:30,560
Support AAC and it's it's pretty easy to come up with lists. I guess which because a lot of them do, but which key ones did not

925
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,960
So the I river does that support it?

926
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,280
Excuse me. Oh, that was rank

927
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
Creative labs don't know

928
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,640
The iPod does support it. I just like to know you know check it out see if you're

929
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,680
MP3 player if it supports AAC files if it doesn't let me know it's interesting

930
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,640
Maybe we should start providing AAC files certainly will help on bandwidth constraints because it does create an actual smaller file size

931
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,760
But I'm amazed I'm amazed by the 32 kbps. That's that's actually I think that's uh

932
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,760
I think that's actually quite impressive those bit rates

933
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,200
Big fan of the source code been listening for a while and uh

934
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:18,640
I have a question for you about OPML. All right. I know you've heard you talk about this in the past and you know a lot of the other podcasters talk a lot about OPML

935
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,320
And

936
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,600
Never really quite understood what it was until I was listening to your source code

937
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,560
From Thursday where you were talking about how the iPod or directory is maintained and

938
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:37,040
It really started it really hit me as you were talking about it that it sounds like OPML is kind of like the RSS

939
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,280
of links

940
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,920
But I get a sense that it could be a little bit more so

941
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,080
Maybe you could talk a little bit more about that correct me if I'm wrong and

942
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:55,840
Keep up the good work. Love this show. Thanks. What I'd love to hear is a Dave Winner morning coffee notes about OPML because he of course is the creator of this format

943
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,240
Which is widely adopted amongst outliners and

944
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Boy if anyone can answer that question is Dave so I'm gonna leave that up to him

945
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
The way I see OPML

946
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,240
Is or the way I use OPML perhaps a better a better way to explain it is

947
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
Well, first of all OPML stands for outline processor

948
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,440
Markup language so just like 18 mail stands for hypertext markup language

949
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,920
Or XML stands for extensible markup language the M and the L

950
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
our consistent outline processor

951
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
I guess we can talk about outliners

952
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,120
So you probably know what an outliner is it's something that is not taught in

953
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:44,000
As far as I know any European schooling system just the even the the art of outlining is not taught

954
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,800
Although we deal with outlines and outliners it every day life all over the place and I am a total outliner

955
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,320
Freak

956
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,640
I use my radio user land outline or for everything because it's just it's the way my brain operates. I love it

957
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,400
And Dave, you know

958
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,200
Totally it's turned me on to that with his software

959
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,200
And so the way I view OPML is it's a way to create XML

960
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,240
Without having to fucking know what you're doing all you have to do is create an outline document

961
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,520
And you know the software then outputs that in

962
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:30,400
Version of XML which of course can then be read by software and computers can do stuff with it very much like we're using the directory

963
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,720
So you know we don't have this huge complicated database or submission system or all this interesting

964
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,000
You know workflow that you can build for a

965
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,840
A resource like ipodder.org. It's just hey, you know, just maintain a list and that's what outlines usually are list of stuff

966
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,520
And and each list each entry the list has a link and that link is the link to the

967
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,760
RSS feed or the podcast feed of that particular show

968
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,360
And because it it's OPML, you know and you can create it in an outliner and then it's all

969
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,280
Consistent standardized XML which poops out of the back which then the directory software

970
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,600
I potted out org understands and can parse

971
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,080
It's it's used for many other things and I think a lot of the confusion if I just understood your question right

972
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,120
Is that it's also being used for something called

973
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,000
Reading lists or subscription lists in fact most iPodders and

974
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,760
Aggregators for weblog aggregators

975
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,920
We'll be able to either import an OPML file which is nothing more than a list of all your subscriptions with

976
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,880
The actual RSS file attached to it as as the link to each node and it also outputs

977
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,080
That same sort of list so it's again a standardized way of of coming up with subscriptions

978
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,120
But in reality, I think OPML is much much much more powerful than that

979
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,280
So maybe we're at a maybe just don't have enough examples of applications

980
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,880
Or it's almost like a marketing problem at this point to explain exactly

981
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,480
You know what can be done with OPML I think and this is the one of things

982
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,160
I you know I want to understand more I've been following Steve Gilmour's attention dot XML

983
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,880
Or what she just calls attention

984
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,200
And I'm not quite rocking everything yet, but

985
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,640
This all does somehow come together with

986
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,600
With routing information

987
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,240
Yeah, I think that's the best way to explain it routing information is standardized

988
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
XML like way

989
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:46,080
Okay, I'm now I'm getting into deep. I don't know. I hope Dave does an OPML morning coffee notes podcast because I think it's it's really needed

990
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:54,320
What we can do with this stuff and could I I feel a little stuck myself once in a while as to you know where we can push it on the directory side though

991
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
I'm very very very happy

992
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,960
Because people who want to maintain a note in the directory they send me emails. Hey, you know, I'd love to take care of that

993
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,000
What do I do and I just send them off to ipod.org slash

994
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,320
Documentation and it's all right there and usually within the same day sometimes today later they come back with an OPML file and say what here

995
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,040
It is you know just to copy the URL where I have this thing stored and boom they're a part of the directory

996
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,440
Okay, 56 minutes boy. This is I feel like I'm cheating almost you know I'm going way past my room

997
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,120
I regular 40 minutes, but I just want to get through all this stuff and and get everything

998
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,480
Getting out that I've been waiting to talk to you about

999
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,720
Oh, the young palette who is aren't number one guy for creating the hit test has a

1000
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,880
Has a a page up where you can get the previous episodes number five is what we're up to today

1001
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,920
We've been emailing back and forth of course. I want to him to get these hit tests up on their own

1002
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,000
podcast feed as well

1003
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But right now there is an archive

1004
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,480
Where you can find them and the URL obviously is listed in the show notes for today

1005
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
All right

1006
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Young polette here

1007
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
With another hit test

1008
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,160
But first let me say that a lot of stuff is happening right now

1009
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,840
Got a lot of great responses on the earlier hit tests and a lot of things are going on right now

1010
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,800
First let me thank Kevin for his additional work

1011
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,920
Some of the things he is making right now and already has made

1012
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,880
Actually expected in a future hit test and also thanks go out to Tom Schuiting

1013
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,680
You'll refer me to yesterday

1014
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,680
He's already

1015
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,840
made me and he's going to take some time to

1016
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,920
Transfer a few air checks into MP3 formats. So I can use them more old bullshit radio

1017
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,920
A lot of questions and comments about the sound processing about the set-up. I'm using

1018
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,960
I'm not sure

1019
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
I want to go into that right now

1020
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,120
Because I think we have to watch out for the fact that this little item is

1021
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,600
Transferring in a some into a podcast of its own. Yeah, a podcast

1022
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,360
Now you're talking and I'm not sure that that is something that we want to do well

1023
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,560
Young it's all up to you. I'm very happy any single time you want to challenge me with a hit test

1024
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,880
I'm happy to do it. You are the original hit test guru. So feel free to do whatever you want

1025
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,720
If you send them to me man, I'll certainly use him of course what it does do is it

1026
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,040
It really puts a lot of other people into you know putting a thinking caps on and I have now

1027
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,800
We're going to do trivia the big trivia on Thursday. I have one two three four five other different types of trivia

Oh, that's great. That's great

1057
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,760
And of course, I'm receiving all of these these great new forms of trivia

1058
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,680
Maybe that's what you should do young maybe you should make a a podcast of all different types of trivia

1059
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:51,760
So not just your own but maybe you should be the the resource you know I make it certainly send you all this stuff that I'm that I'm getting

1060
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,080
And I know I've mentioned on the on the weblog a couple times

1061
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:03,520
But I'm really really really thoroughly enjoying the Gmail experience in fact

1062
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,480
I have given up on my Mac email client given up on my Mac.com email

1063
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:15,440
I'm exclusively using my Gmail account now one of the thousands that I was invited to open up again

1064
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
I really appreciate everyone hook on me up there

1065
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,360
Wow, I mean the way this functions and I'm not quite it must be some JavaScript or something

1066
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,160
I don't know how it works, but you could turn on these keyboard shortcuts so if you want to you know open up a

1067
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,840
You can actually use the J in the K keys which are pretty familiar for anyone who's used

1068
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,560
Vi or pine or you know command line type editor or email client

1069
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,120
To go up and down

1070
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,120
In the in the list of emails

1071
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,360
Then you hit oh to open it and hit y to archive it

1072
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,840
Just art to reply you know, and it's it's fast, you know, it's like you just hit the our boom already you're in the reply box

1073
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,840
You've probably seen it

1074
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,520
So it's great it has this you know all the advantages of web bay system because all your email is somewhere else

1075
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,200
It has the super mega advantage of being able to search your email

1076
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,640
Through through the Google search engine and of course

1077
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:17,600
I love the fact that you hit the forward slash which is the same in VI and that puts your cursor right in the search box

1078
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,920
And it has so all those advantages without the disadvantages of having to use your mouse all the time

1079
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,640
Just keep your hands on the keyboard you barely I'd like if there was one there's one key keyboard shortcut command that I'm missing

1080
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,240
It's

1081
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,600
To report spam so if if you open something up and it's spam there's a little button there that you have to press and it

1082
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,800
Apparently a registers that type of email or whatever it is as spam and

1083
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,000
And it gets rid of it from your from your inbox. I'm not quite sure what it I probably trashes it or something like that

1084
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:58,960
But you still have to move your fingers off the key pad to a mouse or the touch pad to perform that function

1085
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,320
Which I

1086
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,960
Turns out I do that a lot it was funny Patricia

1087
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,720
You know I hooked up with her laptop again, and she's she's been all over as you know we were looking at

1088
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,120
I forget about that

1089
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,800
She's no actually she was looking for something very specific. She was looking for

1090
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,960
Handbags and she was having a real hard time finding which is looking for through Google and you know

1091
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
I'm and I said how are you doing?

1092
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,400
I'm on your computer stuff and she said you know, I feel like a total shit. She said I thought I opened up my email

1093
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,280
And all I do is I just sit there and delete junk and shit that I don't want. You said there's very little

1094
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,200
You know the signal to noise ratio is fucked up. She said I feel like I'm a tool. I'm just a

1095
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,640
A junk mail deletion tool. Not a good experience. We got to get better at that

1096
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,040
Okay, a couple more promos before I go today. We're already

1097
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,280
Almost double our normal time my gosh. We will be punished severely

1098
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,680
broadcasting from the middle of

1099
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,680
No

1100
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,280
Hey Russ, do you know who Adam Curry is?

1101
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:19,520
No, I don't know who Adam Curry is. Well, he used to work for MTV when they played music on that

1102
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
Can you believe that?

1103
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,280
Long time ago. We're going to podcast now. We're at a national geek.blogspot.com

01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,320
Well send me a message because I don't really like to know

1110

1111
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,240
Adam Curry.com. Yeah, I really appreciate that one. Okay. Let's see what is

1112
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,040
What do we have here? Hi Adam. This is Lance Love. I'll send you a radio show

1113
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,240
Yeah, the day about iPodre clients and

1114
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,760
Especially concerning the vacation mode you were saying that

1115
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:20,240
That was a really good powder lemon version two will be coming up with a vacation mode

1116
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
What do you can actually download?

1117
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,960
There's just the most recent

1118
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,960
Podcasts over the entire

1119
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,960
Podcastman very beginning from whichever show just let you know I've been using a great new software program called playpod

1120
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,600
It's actually open source in this free

1121
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,680
It's a 0.3 is the version but I've used it quite often and it has

1122
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,760
Type of

1123
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,760
Feature that you're you're looking for

1124
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,120
Anyways, you might want to give it a shot. You probably already know about it

1125
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,760
Since you are the pod father

1126
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,120
So again, enjoy your show keep it up by listening whenever I can which is almost every day

1127
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,920
And talk to later bye all right. Thank you very much Lance. I think that was

1128
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,480
Yeah, I've been noticing all these great new features that we're seeing and not just in the iPodres

1129
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,840
But also in agregators themselves in fact, I'm a beta testing the net news wire

1130
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
I think I told you about that

1131
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,640
Which now supports podcasting and understands how to

1132
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Get a podcast onto your iTunes

1133
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,040
I don't know if it works with anything else currently

1134
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,400
I've always kind of been you know

1135
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,080
Like I never really want to use any of the the client side agregators because I'm a one-paying

1136
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,240
Agregator guy. I like one page that just has everything from you know with the new stories at the top just like a web log

1137
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,600
All of it down to the older stories at the bottom and if you know

1138
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,520
I don't want it to be like email where I have you know on the left-hand side

1139
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,520
I've got all these podcast where all these

1140
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,320
web logs I'm subscribed to and have to keep you know seeing

1141
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,440
Just this number count grow and grow and grow on on each one like oh I have to go look at

1142
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,560
You know

1143
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,240
I've seen now go look at the New York Times because there's 15 new stories if I don't you know

1144
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,480
I get this guilt feeling. I don't want any of that shit

1145
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,760
I want it to go away. I don't want to have these big numbers of unred stuff and I figured out a way

1146
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,280
To create a view and net news wire which gives me exactly that and it's it's quite good actually

1147
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,040
Because you have you know the all the stuff at the top you can even have

1148
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,880
The the actual descriptions or you know whatever is listed in each posting underneath each

1149
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,400
Fuck it looks just like just like my my one my one pain aggregator

1150
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:40,480
So pretty nice with the advantage that you just hit the right arrow key and it opens up a browser right in the

1151
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,920
application with the with the page that you that you were looking at

1152
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,240
And make it even cooler it integrates with the Mars edit so if you want to

1153
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,240
Post something from the aggregator into your weblog it knows those two applications

1154
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,160
Which come from the same company. I think it's ranchero software ranchero.com

1155
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,000
Then they work together and I'm wondering

1156
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,040
I'm yeah wondering

1157
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:13,520
What how the development is going to move? You know we basically have three pieces. There's like the aggregation part

1158
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,080
which

1159
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,600
It's hard it's really hard and I see a lot of progress being made in aggregator land

1160
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,720
I'm just only using this that news wires the one example

1161
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,440
I know because I've really been using this for a week or two

1162
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,120
Then of course there's the iPod or developments which are all about you know the media files and what I haven't seen yet is what I'd love to have in in my

1163
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,920
iPod or any type of aggregator is the same thing that I have on my sky digital box

1164
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,760
You know it's like how much of

1165
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:47,040
X do we keep around so how either how big can all the podcasts be all together?

1166
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,440
You know could it take up two gigs of space or

1167
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,360
Maybe you can do that by individual podcasts so you know if you have more than three podcasts of

1168
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,400
East radio for instance which are about half an hour in length

1169
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,280
You know if you have if you're three or four behind you know then delete the the oldest one or something like that

1170
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,720
So you don't have to continuously I find myself going in and cleaning up which by the way is a is a cool new feature

1171
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,800
In the iPod or lemon which I test it a little bit there is a cleanup feature

1172
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,240
But I want more of that automated just don't want have to think about it. You know if I missed off just like in the aggregator

1173
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,320
Like my centralized aggregator after 12 hours it's gone

1174
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:35,680
You know it scrolls off but that doesn't mean that I won't see that message again because if it's something that's it floats to the top right so you know a message about

1175
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,560
Let's see what is something

1176
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,360
For instance

1177
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,760
The store the wired new story about

1178
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:53,120
What is it it's titled a here comes bill hide your iPod so you know that's a story that even if I missed it from the wired RSS feed

1179
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,880
You're gonna see it somewhere else because people point to it and it just keeps coming back

1180
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,880
I like bad Mexican food and it's really simple

1181
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,760
It's a real simple way of keeping track of stuff without the guilt of

1182
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:11,840
My gosh, you know there's 15 unread messages in the wired feed. I better go check them out because I'm falling behind

1183
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,040
You know

1184
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,840
You turns out you don't it it comes back from different sources and different channels so maybe you miss it

1185
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,440
Maybe you catch it 10 minutes later or 10 hours later, but you will find it eventually

1186
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,560
So it's I think it if I'm just a much easier way of

1187
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,480
Yeah, much easier way of dealing with information and boy am I am I amineering overload but

1188
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,440
Right now with what net news wire does it deletes its articles after a day

1189
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,880
In combination with my Gmail account. I'm getting a lot better at managing all my info

1190
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,440

1208
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,800

01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,480
Exposure

01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,800
And he's writing the interest of mainly American women have to say

1213
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,560
Start his yard that he's intellectual capacity

1214
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,120
Let me show you what I'm talking about

1215
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:21,200
Wait a minute show wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is that? Is that that? Let me hear that again

1216
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,120
I'm just making sure I understood that right

1217
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,280
It's wanting to throw themselves at his intellectual capacity

1218
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,240
Let me show you what I'm in. I'll give you a couple of extra social merch

1219
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,280
I'll whisper with habei

1220
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:38,000
Well hello there are podcasts people. It's time for our regular feature words of wisdom with Harry and

1221
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,240
Yeah, Harry and I were talking about Parliamentary sovereignty versus the European Union

1222
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,800
And about the difficulty that they single European currencies facing at the moment

1223
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,200
We're talking of course about the euro

1224
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,080
And I was talking with Harry over the breakfast table saying to him Harry

1225
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,800
I really am disconcerting young man about the single European currency

1226
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,280
I can't ever see myself wanting to lose the British pound

1227
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,440
You know it's been never centuries. What do you think? Well Harry strikes his chin and reply to his follows

1228
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:20,160
My finger but instead never a blink wish a pound by a wolf is stinking to you

1229
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,880
That's my finger

1230
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
Why everybody

1231
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,640
Britain should never relinquish the pound in favor of the stinking euro. I couldn't agree more

1232
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,680
Okay, thanks very much indeed Adam

1233
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,960
We look forward to seeing you on podcast Paul dot com

1234
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,320
I seem probably podcast Harry dot com knowing him bless him. He's always trying to steal the line light

1235
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,760
Stop pouring out your kids. Well, yeah, don't do that. Oh, that was pretty funny

1236
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:58,080
Yeah, the euro Africa. It's not about the money man. It's not about the money. It's about the control and if you if you change the money then the next thing is the control

1237
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:04,160
So I guess I kind of got agree, you know and by the way those those 50 p coins with all the all the

1238
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,200
Different sides on it. It kind of cool. So I like I like the English money not wrong with that

1239
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:14,320
I don't know shit about the economics of changing from the pound to the euro, but I'm quite sure

1240
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,120
Having lived in two countries that converted to the euro

1241
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:24,400
Belgium from the Frank and the Netherlands from the Gilder that they got fucked by the European Union

1242
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,000
And there's more fucking to come with that constitution

1243
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:34,560
Anyway, that's it for the source code an extra long double shot
