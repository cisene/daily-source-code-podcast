1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Resource Code April 22nd, 2005.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your DJ has only just begun.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm just kidding.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Coming to you from the cottage in Guilford and Lovely Surrey UK.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's your daily source code.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's out of my curry and the big green thing, chilled out.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Relaxed.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've got the cast blaster on the lap.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Got the high powered microphone and the boom kind of like flowing over the green thing.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the way to do a show.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let me tell you.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I mean, I could even be doing my nails.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Got a pedicure on doing this.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is great.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, man.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I feel fuzzy today.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I really do.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's been such an incredibly long week and tense week.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Lots of traveling, lots of flying.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thanks for all the comments and feedback on the sound seem to or from yesterday.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It seems like even though there was quite a bit that I recorded,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
including driving around with taxi Eric and the Dutch Marines.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The actual flying lessons, the training sessions seem to grab everybody's fancy.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I must say it was without a doubt my favorite part too.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Of course, whenever I sit down and do a show, my phone immediately starts ringing.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Just put that over there.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alrighty.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So it's the last day of the week.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's early here.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's five minutes to eleven.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm trying to get into a regular rhythm again and get a swing going here,

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so that I can pretty much get back to my schedule every single day.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All the traveling definitely messed it up a bit.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I had some time to browse through podcast alley.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
See what's hot.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I had a chance to look at the new podcast that comes through an iPod.org.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Also, the promo has been coming in.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you very much for sending them in the way I requested.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you want to send me a promo, send it to Adam at Curry.com and put in the subject line.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
DSC space promo and then whatever the heck your promo is about.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hey, Adam.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the song we're at a Craig Manganella from Rockaway.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Crings New York.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I've got a podcast.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My fans is a great way to communicate gig dates.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Another important thing about my music.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The fans that subscribe to my RSS feed also get to hear my new songs.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So immediately after I record left track.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So if you have listening to like indie music, tell them to come visit my site, Craig'sMusic.net

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and subscribe to my podcast.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey, you know what?

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I see more and more musicians these days doing that and starting to understand the power of the podcast and what you can do with it.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know, necessarily have to even, you know, record a show or anything.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can just have a website and just put your new music in a podcast feeds.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The people can receive that and enjoy it and listen to it.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Show notes are pretty important with that stuff.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Because you want people, you know, once it's on your MP3 player and, you know, just kind of shows up there.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know, it's, it may not be easy for people to find out where it came from.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I think that what you should be targeting in that case is probably the podcasters themselves.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I had a couple of phone conferences last week with some people in the, in the record industry.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And they're not, you know, they're not all evil.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll tell you.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In fact, they're running scared.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The record industry, the music industry is really worried.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you, if you had a chance, or if you have a chance, check out Forbes.com.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Send Whitmore, wrote a very well researched piece, I thought, or at least,

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
regarding the music industry part about the rights and what you can play.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And he, he does the deadhead podcast.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you've never heard that, you should definitely check it out.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And he went around to all of these, and I think there was five or six of them.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The agencies whose job it is to collect money for the use of records from music,

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
whether it's in an elevator, on a radio station, on a podcast, on a download, on a stream.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You know, whatever it is.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And basically, everyone said, well, we don't know yet.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Works still kind of waiting to see what happens.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I think I understand why they're waiting to see.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's because the record industry, who, of course, are totally on to podcasting.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, what's going on?

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They're listening to them.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I mean, we know that I had a meeting with Harvey Leeds from Epic Records.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And, you know, he even wants to do his own podcast.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So they clearly see the promotional value of it.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And, you know, it's, it's going to be a business decision, which, unfortunately,

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
lawyers will also help the record industry make.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But when I talked to them, I said, look, there's one thing that we don't have on the radio anymore

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
that we do have in podcasting.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And that's the whole concept of somebody really promoting a song or a band or an artist or a CD,

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
or whatever, because they genuinely like it.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And that's what radio used to bring us.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It used to, you know, used to be able to flip on the radio and hear some excited, hyperactive DJ

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
saying, man, I love this record.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I got to play it again for you.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You know, where the day is when, when a disjockey would lock himself in the studio.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And would say, you know, and would defy whatever management had told him and was going to play this record

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
every hour until they dragged him out and dragged that record from his cold dead fingers.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You know, that used to happen, believe it or not.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It used to happen quite a lot.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And just the excitement about about a piece of music that you really like passing that on to people.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's the best promotion you can get.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I mean, when, when do you, when you get interested in a band when someone says, hey, check it out.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, of course, we have that on a one to one basis.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We've had that on the internet for quite a while.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And I, and I don't like the word independent music or indie music or indie music scene.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think pod safe is a much better way to go because if we can create pod safe music.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And maybe that, maybe that's something that we could talk to Lawrence Lessick about.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Who, of course, does creative commons.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Maybe we can create a pod safe license, which is just one of their standard default that you can select,

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
which basically will give any pod cast or the right to use their music on a pod cast.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And perhaps the deal is that if you do that, then you at least have to point back to a place where information can be found about it.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, you know, there's something brewing here that really is.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And, and I'm going to try and make it my business to figure out if we can, if we can push that through,

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
if we can get the record industry to understand the incredible value of this type of promotion.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And it's for, and it's for a number of reasons because you have basically, I think you have like three.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You have three types of music that that we have to look at licensing.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
One, of course, is I think the least interesting for pod cast is, you know, the, the top 100.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You know, whatever's being played on radio now and is being sold by the millions is not that interesting to us.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because you can get that somewhere else.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you think about all of the great back catalog and some, you know, bands that who have just kind of, you know, well, they're old now, right?

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And they have all this tremendous amount of music that, you know, longer are exposed to because radio's no longer playing it.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, I think, well, let me take that back.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Sidelight radio, of course, is very good for back catalog.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But think about it, you know, I've played a couple of really old songs here and immediately I get tons of email of people saying,

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, man, I, I had never heard that Chicago track before I went out and bought the, bought the CD off of iTunes or I bought that particular track off of iTunes.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That happens all the time.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I think there's a tremendous amount of value in back catalog.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Very much like Amazon, you know, there's so many books at amazon.com, which you just can't find in a bookstore.

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So what do you do? You know, Amazon is large enough and has the right type of infrastructure to have pieces of catalog like that, which a normal bookstore just has doesn't have the space for.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So out of print, out of date, out of fashion, but still full of very wonderful, good memories for anybody who's ever heard is song or want to reintroduce to a particular band.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Look at green day for Christ's sex. I saw them at Woodstock too.

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, I tell my daughter for her Woodstock too is the original Woodstock, right?

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, she says, wow, this guy's been around a long time and, you know, I was able to introduce her to green day who now, of course,

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
you know, really have a revival on their hands and are, you know, doing tremendously well.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But I also am able to pick up songs for her and introduce like the sex pistols and the clash and early rolling stones.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And yes, of course, she all she can recognize a Beatles tune from a million miles away.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So that's the kind of stuff that is very valuable and that we can do a lot with on podcasting.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then, of course, there's the pod safe music, which is this enormous amount of music that is being put up online for people to enjoy.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's being used to promote people's, you know, an artist's gigs where you can see them.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Some of them want to go up to larger distribution and would like to be in record stores and perhaps they actually want a real record deal.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know if, you know, I don't know if I'd want one personally.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think there are a lot of people who are not interested and would like to see if this can be done on the smaller scale where you may sell less.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right, but you can be keeping a lot more of what it's actually being sold.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I'm very excited about some of the conversations that have been going on.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And maybe as I said, maybe it's a good place to start that we come up with a pod safe creative commons license that can be easy for musicians to understand.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
To bake right into their MP3, I know there's tools available for that.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Maybe that's something should, you know, be a part of the creative commons site.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know, but let's think about that because there's a lot going on.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He had him, this is Susie Chase and my pod cast is the groove.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And our of the best of today's R&B and classic soul.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So there you have it, Adam, my podcast promo for the groove.

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can check me out at Susie Chase Osborn.blogspot.com.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
As Susie, why see H-A-S-E-O-S-B-O-R-A.blogspot.com?

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know it's on.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You have a great day, Adam.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thanks a lot.

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All right, holy macro, that's a very long URL.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, I'll put that in the show notes as along with all the other URLs for the promos that I play on the show.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Again, if you want to send me a promo, send it to DailySort.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We add to adamaccurry.com, put in the subject line D-S-C space promo.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That way my filter will be able to catch it, so I have a nice bin of promos that I can just go into and choose a couple for each show.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And then also put the name of your promo in the podcast.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
As I said, I was looking at iPod.org today.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The scripts are back running and stuff is updating again, and there's still quite a backlog of, I think, several hundreds of podcasts,

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but I just can't post all at once, you know, because we'd have a tremendously large page on the homepage.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I try to, you know, get as many on there as possible and try to keep the flow moving every single day.

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And at the top of the list, this morning when I looked was mashuptown.com, a weekly mashup podcast.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So I immediately went over to the page and oh yeah, found something my like, this is booty station on the DailySort's code for Friday April 22.

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:13:03,000
to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and

174
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over

175
00:13:33,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and then I went over to the page, and I went over to the page, and then

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's been a long time, you and I

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's been a long time, you and I

It's been a long time, you and I

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh yeah, stick it in your ear baby.

208
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Shooting station.

209
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Of course, Stevie Wonder's superstition mixed and matched up with pretty dishes.

210
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That is art.

211
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That is art.

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I love it.

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Can't get enough of the mash.

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're a pure, pure, pure, cool laser sounds.

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Pure.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're a fantastic daily source girl.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's all that I'm cool.

218
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hey Adam.

219
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This is my D from my daily commute.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Possibly the only podcast brought to you from a moving car.

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm on over and listen to me mues and wax rhapsodic while treging off to the daily grind.

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Subscribe now at feeds.feetburner.com slash my daily commute.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, okay.

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't know if it's the only podcast from a moving vehicle.

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We've done quite a lot of that.

226
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Remember Raymond Port who pulled up next to me and was listening to a source code.

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, I was recording a new one.

228
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, it's been happening.

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But it doesn't matter because I love listening to people in vehicles of all kinds.

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's just something about it.

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I had a great visitor here yesterday from the BBC radio forum.

232
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
A radio legend literally.

233
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Peter Day, who works for Radio 4 and also BBC World Service.

234
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He does the shows.

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He presents in business and global business.

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And it was great.

237
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The setup.

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But this has been set up a long time ago.

239
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And I thought that, you know, I don't know who was coming over.

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I had no idea who this.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well, I knew that he was well known Peter Day from his from his work.

242
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But I had never heard him because I'm not quite sure when his show airs on radio 4,

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
when he's on the on the world service.

244
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And this, it was, oh, man.

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean, this typical English, you know, distinguished little bit older,

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
but sheveled gentleman shows up and with a big booming radio voice.

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And he was just, you know, it was actually very nice to hear a,

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
you know, just one of those old fashioned, beautiful warm, you know,

249
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
wrap you in a blanket type voices.

250
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And it was funny because he came all by himself,

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
came in from London to the train to the cab, came to the house.

252
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And he had his, he had a little mini disc recorder to record our interview on because it was a radio interview.

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But he still had the old fashioned gray, you know,

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
two big, two ugly BBC approved microphone.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That was attached to it.

256
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So, and he was really looking at my high river and, you know,

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
with just a, a glint of jealousy in his eye saying,

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
oh, wow, I wish we could use these, these types of machines.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is what the BBC should be doing.

260
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And it was great.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He went, you know, way beyond the, you know,

262
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
what is podcasting?

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How did it come to be?

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He was really into the, okay,

265
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
what does this mean to me and my 35 year career in broadcasting?

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And it was just a wonderful conversation.

267
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And this guy has interviewed presidents and prime ministers and popes and,

268
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and you name it.

269
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And he had some great stories.

270
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And I was just coaxing him the whole time saying,

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
man, we need you.

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We need you to come into our community and help us out.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Teach us.

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You know, it's not just about what kind of mic you use and how well it records.

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But that is of course something that's important as well.

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But what decisions do you make?

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How do you get a conversation going?

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
How do you pull the information out of the subject that you're interviewing with?

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
How do you make it a conversation?

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And then when you edit it down,

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
what do you put in there and why do you make those choices?

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And also I said, wouldn't it be interesting if you could take all of that material?

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Because we sat here for at least an hour and a half yesterday.

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Just nonstop talking, Patricia actually was laughing out loud because you said,

285
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
you guys, you're sitting up there because he was upstairs in the office with me.

286
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So I can hear every single word downstairs because you're all talking with those big radio voices.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So real sweetheart this guy was, and smart.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh my god, I had to work overtime just to keep up with him.

289
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But he had all the right questions.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And of course he promised that he'd let me know when it'll air.

291
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll shoot him another email just to remind him to do that.

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Because I'd love to put a piece of that on the podcast.

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because he really did understand when we talk about the monoculture and basically dismantling that

294
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and making it possible for anybody to broadcast.

295
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He was really onto the big ideas of that.

296
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And it was just so refreshing to have someone talk about that and really want to know what the implications can be.

297
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And he did say something interesting though.

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He said, you are one of the gap closers.

299
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And I thought that was a beautiful description because I did only close 5% of the gap for this all to happen.

300
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And that's something that keeps coming up in conversation.

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And so when we talked about the music business and how can we change that and how will it change?

302
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And what will happen to traditional radio.

303
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And of course that's not just what radio is.

304
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
In fact, we did stumble upon some interesting things when you say radio.

305
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But really that used to mean radio receiver would used to be after that came transistor radio receiver.

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You have a radio transmitter, but radio has now become a description for what you hear on the radio.

307
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But of course, that's not really all the radio is radio used to be the green hornet and the lone ranger.

308
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And now these wonderful plays and shows that were acted out.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And the BBC still does just fabulous soundscapes and interviews on location with people.

310
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So you can hear and you're really there on the spot.

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And it's not just soundbite and boom, we're back to the studio.

312
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So that's all the stuff that we're going to relearn.

313
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And I hate reinventing the wheel, but we are going to do a lot of that as we all kind of get our chops together and figure out what we can do with this.

314
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And I'm just I'd love to get a guy like that into our community and podcasting.

315
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So I'm trying, I'm doing the best I can.

316
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Hello, my name is Scott and I'm Kelly and we're the creators of MyVirtualBand.com.

317
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm MyVirtualBand.com.

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Members from all over the world collaborate online, try to record songs.

319
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
For instance, members can take a tune like this.

320
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And turn it into this.

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You can hear more great songs created on MyVirtualBand.com and our podcasts available at www.radio.myvirtualband.com.

322
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And if you're a singer, songwriter or musician and would like to join in the fun, simply go to www.myvirtualband.com.

323
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Register and you can start collaborating today.

324
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Until next time, I'm Kelly and I'm Scott, rock on.

325
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's kind of cool.

326
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So I guess with myvirtualband.com, you can pick up tracks and add to them, which is a very cool idea.

327
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I wonder if you have to do that on a standard setup or if that's all MIDI or how it works,

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but it sounds like there's a great place to go collaborate with other musicians I presume.

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm still, of course, beta testing, the cast blaster application, which is this beautiful

330
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
little console that I record my podcast with.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
At least when I'm back in the green thing studio at the cottage.

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And on that promo, I was really weird.

333
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My level, my meters just were all over the board there.

334
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm not quite sure it was going on.

335
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Also, I've gotten some feedback that, although the microphone sounds good now, that sometimes

336
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the songs either sound out of phase or still a little too boomy.

337
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And I really, the only thing I can come up with, because this is pretty much,

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
there's no cables, there's no routing that can really go wrong and put it out of phase I presume.

339
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think that the sound card that's built into this tablet is probably just a piece of shit.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And that's probably what's causing any trouble.

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If you're hearing any, that's probably what's causing it.

342
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You know, what is it like, a 16-bit sound card, which probably, you know,

343
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know how that works, but it's probably doing 12 bits or something like that.

344
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Hey, that's what you get when you buy in a Veritech laptop, ladies and gentlemen.

345
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I love the show's and YouTube are a riot, and Alex from Switzerland says,

346
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Charlie and Carol made Israel a place of life and laughter.

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Matt tells us, I just want to do right, and let you know that I'm addicted to Israelisms.

348
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Israelisms.com is the version only irreverent weekly podcast,

349
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:59,000
that's the most puking promo I've heard in a long time.

350
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That reminds me of top 40 radio is right back in your face puking,

351
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
but okay, we get it, and it actually is a pretty interesting podcast.

352
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Israelisms.com. It does make Israel a shining place, and it's nice,

353
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
you know, it's the same thing as when I went to Iraq,

354
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
and I've said this before, you know, you have this vision of what the place is like,

355
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
which is totally been created by MSM, mainstream media has given us,

356
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and we know why, because like hey, you know, wait a minute,

357
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
let me just stand in front of the shell out building and then take the picture,

358
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
or, you know, let's do the stand up over here with all the children who are playing in the mud and the,

359
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and the drag, you know, that'll really tug on the hard strings of America

360
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
or television, a global television audience.

361
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then when you suddenly are there, and you notice that life has continued to go on,

362
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and people are, you know, getting married, and having children, and creating work, and jobs,

363
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and building houses, and of course, that's not everywhere in Iraq.

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But, you know, the same goes for Israel, you know, when you think of Israel, you think immediately

365
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
of terrorists to a side bombers, you know, that's pretty much what is conjured to mind immediately.

366
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And if you hear that, Israelisms.com podcast, it will give you a different perspective, I think.

367
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, no, I know for sure, which is just another beautiful thing about what we're doing.

368
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And here's a problem I want you to listen to, because I was kind of amazed that this kind of show is cropping up

369
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
as a podcast. Well, I'll talk about it in a second, listen to the promo first.

370
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If you haven't yet listened to Rainbow Gossips, you won't know which singing star and the

371
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
snazzy found online looking for love from the internet.

372
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You also won't know which news anchor posted this confession of an affair in an online forum.

373
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You also may not know what old spies Jerry Hallewell keeps in her bedside cabinet.

374
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
There's no point in knowing a really good bit of gossip about the rich and famous, unless you pass it on.

375
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Traditionally, focus shared such tidbits of the garden fence or at the water cooler.

376
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Now, Rainbow Gossips gives you the chance to share your gossip with the world.

377
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It really is very simple. You write to us a lot of gossip and we put you in the podcast.

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What could be fluffier?

379
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So, but you've seen a slab out shopping or plumbing, or you've witnessed a stellar

380
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
hisific, we want to know, and so does the world.

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Pull us up or drop us a line.

382
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And if you haven't been listening, subscribe to the Rainbow Gossips podcast

383
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
at www. RainbowGossips.com.

384
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
RainbowGossips, it's the global water cooler.

385
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Fun.

386
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay.

387
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So, I think there's enough of that.

388
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You know, I think there's enough celebrity television programs,

389
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
magazines filled with pictures of celebrities and gossip.

390
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Is that really something that we need more of?

391
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And I'll tell you specifically for my own experience.

392
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This morning, as an example, at 815, the phone rings.

393
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's one of our neighbors.

394
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And she says, there's a man standing across the road with a telephoto lens

395
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and he's taking pictures of your house.

396
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And, you know, of course, it's some gossip magazine

397
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
from, well, more than likely, from the Netherlands.

398
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And it's like, you know, we have enough of that.

399
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's what those guys do.

400
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You know, like, with podcasting, you can really, you know, get much more.

401
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You can go much further than that.

402
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Let's get Jerry Hal, howly well to do a podcast.

403
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'll be a lot more fun than just saying, oh, you know, here's what she was eating.

404
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Here's what she was wearing.

405
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And, you know, and the derogatory old spice.

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You know, it's like that's so mean.

407
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And, you know, there are people too, okay?

408
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Really, it's mean when you say that stuff.

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And if you don't know someone, you know,

410
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
it's like if someone said that about your friend or your family or your mom

411
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
or your wife, you know, you'd be pissed off if people were slagging him.

412
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And then you'd probably do something about it.

413
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So I'm not a big fan of trying to pull that kind of mainstream media ideas.

414
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know, there's so much more interesting things that we can

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and we should be should be doing.

416
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That said, Paris Hilton will be starting her podcast.

417
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Hold on, I think it's, let me see, April 29th.

418
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm not quite sure if this is a one-off deal

419
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
to promote the House of Wax movie or she'll continue doing it.

420
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Of course, I hope she'll continue doing it.

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And that will be one of the questions I'm going to ask her

422
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
because it's not 100% set in stone yet,

423
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
but we've actually narrowed down a day

424
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and I'm working on the actual hours when it could happen.

425
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But it looks like I can set up a Skype call with that Paris

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and interviewer because the, well, here's how it works, right?

427
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So the movie promotion is starting to crank up.

428
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
She'll do a big press junket probably in LA

429
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and I don't know if she's going to other countries or whatever,

430
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
you know, if this is an international release.

431
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But, you know, essentially they take time out for radio stations

432
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and they've also honored my request

433
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and it looks like we're going to get any to you with Paris Hilton.

434
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And funny enough, what they were talking about

435
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and they is Warner movies was that I would be able to interview Paris

436
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
for the Daily Source Code and I would be interviewing her

437
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
which would also be a part of her podcast.

438
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And I don't know if that was their idea of hers, but I love it.

439
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You know, so that could be fantastic.

440
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What I'd like to know is what should we talk to her about?

441
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You know, besides the obvious, if you have any questions,

442
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
send them off to AtomitCurry.com.

443
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You know what, why don't we do the same thing

444
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
so I can filter out all of these emails, put in Paris question

445
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and then as the subject line

446
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and then perhaps even the topic of the question after that.

447
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So I can filter it all out and I won't lose track of it.

448
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And over the next couple of days,

449
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
we'll also discuss some of these questions and we can start.

450
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, we'll do it like as much of a community as possible

451
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
if we can speak of a community here at the Daily Source Code.

452
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Which I think we can?

453
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I, yes.

454
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Hello.

455
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Hello.

456
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And Daily Source Code listener.

457
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes, that's all you guys.

458
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This is Ted.

459
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He's a TEDbot.fund.ms.

460
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You can go over to our show

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and check it out for jokes, fun, and songs.

462
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There's even unexpected stuff like this.

463
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So come on over to TEDbot.fund.ms.

464
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But you never know what's going to happen at all.

465
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
TEDbot.fund.ms.

466
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
TEDbot.fund.ms.

467
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Thank you.

468
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
This is Ted.

469
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay.

470
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Wonderful.

471
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Keep in common.

472
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Can't get enough of them.

473
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
By the way, it won't air today,

474
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
or we won't put it out today.

475
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But Ron and I are going to do our strategy cast.

476
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So I'll either all at least over the weekend

477
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
or we'll release it from Monday.

478
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Maybe Monday show because Monday is a much better day for a lot of flow.

479
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Let's see.

480
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We're 30 minutes into it.

481
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That means time for the casting.

482
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Thank you.

483
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Thank you.

484
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's time for the hit.

485
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
With your pull-ups.

486
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Hey, Adam.

487
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This is hit test number 34.

488
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And as you'll probably hear,

489
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
it's a bit strange sounding.

490
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That's because I'm testing my new setup.

491
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I've got new hardware, new software,

492
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and a new microphone.

493
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And it's a bit cheap sounding at the moment.

494
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I can't really think about that.

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Unfortunately, it's a Blentronics headset.

496
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm using it.

497
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's connected to a new notebook.

498
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I've got a few days ago.

499
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And it's the dot audio 90 headset.

500
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That isn't cheap.

501
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
In fact, it's the most expensive non-USB version of the headset

502
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
available from my Blentronics.

503
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But it sounds really cheap, and that's because it's probably

504
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
because it's made for Skype.

505
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Oh, Scott.

506
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And therefore, the mic has a limited frequency range.

507
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And that is a bit of a shame because it sounds really shitty.

508
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay, young.

509
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
First of all, I love it when you send me another hit test.

510
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We're already up to number 34.

511
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I can't tell you how much I appreciated.

512
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And it doesn't matter.

513
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It doesn't sound shitty, by the way.

514
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
At least your shitty microphone doesn't sound too shitty.

515
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm my shitty earphone.

516
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's more like a telephone than a microphone.

517
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, no, no, no.

518
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But I'm using a notebook to record this hit test.

519
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's the setup I will be using in the coming months.

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's because I won't be able to take all the external gear I'm using here with me.

521
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So it's a bit of getting used to the new hardware,

522
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
also to the new software because I'm using better number eight of cast blaster.

523
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I've been goofing around with the earlier versions.

524
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And some changes have already been made by mic.

525
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And I must say that mic has done a really great job.

526
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Hey, hold on a second.

527
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I have beta number five.

528
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
How did you get beta number eight?

529
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's what the job delivering this piece of software.

530
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That is great.

531
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's tool to create a podcast.

532
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And yeah, it is really great software.

533
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Some new changes have been made since better number five that you've been using.

534
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Well, kind of.

535
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And again, that's what I get when I go on the road.

536
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You know, I don't get all the latest beta.

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You're using number eight also right now.

538
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
At least if you had the time to sort through all your mail.

539
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes, yes.

540
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm waiting for you when you've got back.

541
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay, it has some really great additions.

542
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm able now to start all the jingles or sound effects or clips with the function keys.

543
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So I have one to f10 can be used to start and stop all the top 10 files that are preloaded.

544
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And there's also a clear function, which clears all the files that you'll enter into the slots.

545
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah, cool.

546
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's.

547
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Well, except for the mic, everything is up to standards.

548
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And of course there's a hit test.

549
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So if you're ready, we're going to start right away.

550
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm ready, buddy.

551
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's number one.

552
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Pick it.

553
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Woo!

554
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Papa.

555
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That would be the best of my love.

556
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

557
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
LTD loves tenderness and devotions.

558
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Great song.

559
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Can't wait to hear the answer.

560
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And this is number two.

561
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Lower branding and self control.

562
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, you made it easy for me today, y'all.

563
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, it's definitely more branding.

564
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I miss her.

565
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
She passed away recently.

566
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Okay.

567
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I should wait, I guess, for my time signal.

569
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
There we go.

570
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is the final one.

571
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Number three.

572
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Papa.

573
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Papa.

574
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Papa.

575
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Papa.

576
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
In my house, uh, vanity six or apelonia six, one or the two.

577
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
In my, or Mary Jangers.

578
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Mary Jangers.

579
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
These are the answers.

580
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
This is answer.

581
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Number one.

582
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, yeah.

583
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Maybe.

584
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's a golden oldie.

585
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Woo!

586
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The emotions.

587
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh, this is a bonus.

588
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay.

589
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I got half a point.

590
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The emotions and the best of our love.

591
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's a number one in today's hit test.

592
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And this is number two.

593
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's Laura Brannigan.

594
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The emotions and the best of our love.

595
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's a number one in today's hit test.

596
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And this is number two.

597
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's Laura Brannigan.

598
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And the song is titled self-control.

599
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I love this one.

600
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And how this became a hit to still, uh, unknown for me.

601
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because it's a really shitty song.

602
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
No, it's great.

603
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It still became a hit.

604
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Laura Brannigan and self-control.

605
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Answer number two in today's hit.

606
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You're too young.

607
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You're too young.

608
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You're a member of this.

609
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Answer number three.

610
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The Mary Jangers.

611
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
In my house.

612
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is in my house.

613
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And in good today.

614
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Take a girl.

615
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You can just leave my goal in my life.

616
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Tomorrow.

617
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Tomorrow.

618
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Answer number three in today's hit.

619
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,600
Produced by Rick James, the Mary Jane Girls and in my house, and that's it for a hit this number

620
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:19,640
34 good one, entirely recorded using the cast-blast new software at 8th version of cast-blaster

621
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:27,640
and I just thought of a new addition to this software so I will go email that to my right away

622
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,880
and hopefully there will be a public release very soon because I heard that many people are very

623
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,360
interested in using this software and you should be because it is really great

624
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,200
okay well Adam this is the end of hit this number 34 I hope you enjoyed this one

625
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,840
and of course if anyone knows I had said with a better sounding mic please let me know

626
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:58,600
if that's at gmail.com and the web address is ympolet.nl that's j and b-o-l-e-t.nl

627
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,720
but Adam by the way you are right this is number 34 and I have still never met you

628
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:13,720
still never spoken to you in person so maybe you can change that in a very short time

629
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
because I will be gone in less than three weeks

630
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,760
well as I said this is the setup I will be using in the coming months

631
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,680
so I can't change a lot about it but please let me know what you think thank you for listening

632
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,480
and see you next time bye bye all right yon thank you very much my friend once again wonderful

633
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,640
and okay if I can make it over in three weeks I really have no more business in the Netherlands at

634
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,960
all there's nothing left for me to do there except visit family and I try to bring them over here

635
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,280
I certainly will try to hook up with you and if not you know it'll it'll it'll it'll it'll
