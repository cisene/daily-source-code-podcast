1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-7-3

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't see threats.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry, information you don't get out of it.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now I'm Korean.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was 16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm signing you to the future.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, good afternoon from Curry Cottage.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is Thursday.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is the third of November 2005 from a very rainy wet and dark gilfer.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's time for your daily source code.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Kick it off with a mellow mashup for the day.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Every day, every day, every day, every day.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Every day, every day, every day, every day.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Every day, every day, every day.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is a wonderful,

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
inside of me so I'm too good.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now I'm there, I get in the phone.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm all alone, I'm so blessed.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I am beautiful.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No matter what they say or what they say or what they say or what they say.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now, for no more.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I am beautiful.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When we're single, we're here.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
First can bring me down, for no more.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So don't you bring me down, for no more.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No matter what they say or what they say or what they say or what they say or what they say or what they say or what they say.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now, for no more.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So don't you bring me down, for no more.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So don't you bring me down, for no more.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So don't you bring me down, for no more.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So don't you bring me down, for no more.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So don't you bring me down, for no more.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's kind of pretty.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So Christina Aguilera, mash it up with Bob James.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Beautiful versus in the garden.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Good use of ID three tags there by ad of mashuptown.com, saying in the album title, making Adam a happy clam.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A lot of response to yesterday's show.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, man.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Most of you thought it was pretty funny, particularly the Mads rant and Patricia's Pickles and all that crap.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Literally that crap.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Cast Blaster Mike was not happy at all with my windows rant.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Man, I really threw him off.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And, you know, he's developing in Windows.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And he had a really bad day.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I apologize.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mike, nothing personal, obviously.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I've just been assimilated, dude.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's my entire problem.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I've been assimilated by the art.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So a little bit later, the normal today.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Right now it's two when I started 135 British Standard Time.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So I'll be 12.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, I don't want to get near that UTC code.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't want to mess it up for Zulu time.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A little late because well, two things happened actually.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
One is Gmail had an outage this morning, which was, yeah, I was actually, it was pretty significant.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I kept getting the friendly messages like,

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ooh, the system couldn't handle your request right now.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And stuff was breaking all over the place.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And it kind of gave me like, like, you know, like a little chill there thinking,

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh my god, if I think how much of my information is stored with the Google,

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
well, particularly in Gmail, how much of my life is in there and that I really depend on.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And it's like, well, yeah, of course, I could make all kinds of local backups and pop the nail out and all that stuff.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But that's kind of not the point.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I guess I've never really read their terms.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What happens over, you know, how, how, well, actually, I think their whole business should be securing and protecting my data.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So I'm just going to assume that they will and that they do, but might not be a bad idea to,

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to grab a copy of everything of all the, God, it must be at least 30,000 messages in there right now.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We know the size of it, so that's not a big deal.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What is it now? We're up to, I'm almost all, like, I'm like, at three gigs.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, you know, I have that special gigazoid four gig limit.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I love it. I wonder if that's going to start growing once they start hitting that limitation.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So anyway, so that did lay everything because everything that I have is always stored in Gmail.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And, you know, I got to download all the different promos and stuff that people have sent me.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And I've forward a lot of stuff to myself to, you know, with special rules so that it's tagged and labeled in a certain way.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So that I kind of, it's kind of a live organization system, which works quite well, actually.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Could do, we could do it even better, but yeah, I'd have to get into it.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's say Springsteen Chase out of Fort Lauderdale by Wilma.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hold on, this is just one of those, I never look at those web clips on Gmail. What does this say?

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And does it write at the top of my email? It had this message.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's a guess it's an AP report sending me over to news.yahoo.com and what does it say?

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
With much of Florida still recovering from Hurricane Wilma, Bruce Springsteen has been forced to cancel as November 3rd,

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
solo acoustic show near Fort Lauderdale because of officials' concerns over public safety.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow. The rocker, I love how they say that. The rocker, the loved one, the material girl.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We'll now play the seminal hard rock live arena in Hollywood, Florida on the 19th, according to a message on his website,

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Springsteen.net.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay. Coolio.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's the first time I've ever clicked on one of those at the top of Gmail.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And there was also a message here that said, Google Mail in the UK, right at the top of my Gmail.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think we went over this before that there's a trademark dispute over the name Gmail.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And so as of October 19th, I'm reading here, Google Mail in the UK will start handing out Google Mail.com addresses.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why the name chains? We've been involved in a dispute regarding the Gmail trademark in the UK.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Another company is claimed right to the Gmail name.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We have tried to resolve this dispute through negotiations, but our efforts have failed.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You didn't want to pay the prices what that means.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Still working with the courts and trademark office to protect our ability to use the Gmail name,

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
but in the meantime, we want you to have an email address that you can rely on.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay. So the address is good.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And more importantly, please, please take care of my data.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is, you know, with that Windows live stuff, this is going to be a big deal, I think.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, because now, what is it live office, I guess, and you'll be,

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
yeah, was it someone sent me an email, and I actually tried to fire this thing up.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's, oh, God, I can't remember the name of it now, but it's, it's,

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
think office, think free, think free, I think it is office.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I tried to run it on my Mac. It looks cool because you can create word documents,

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Excel documents, and PowerPoint documents in a web browser.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And then, of course, it said, hey, you don't have the latest JRE, you know, 9,000 or whatever,

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
with a link to a page on the Apple site, which was non-existent,

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
God hate that.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And then my Mac popped up saying, you have 97 megs worth of update to download for the OSX update.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I did that and I'll go back to think free thing and see if that works.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I remember those guys around quite a while ago, but I didn't know that they now had kind of this,

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the browser and the service metaphor, which is very interesting.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We're seeing some really interesting things happening, particularly what Microsoft is doing,

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
very interesting to see where this is going to take us.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So far, the demo that they have at live.com doesn't really work in Firefox.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It works somewhat, but I tried it out on the, on the craplet and got definitely different results.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So we'll wait until they fix that, until I can really comment on it.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So today we have a couple of pod save tunes, obviously.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think only two promos and lots of feedback, as I said, the feedback about yesterday's show,

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and it's very obvious, there's only one real star here in the cottage, and that will be my wife.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I talked to her last night and I said, could you come in more often during this show?

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't care what you say, just come in more often, please.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She said she would.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We'll see.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hello Adam, this is Andy from the Skinny on Sports or T-Sauce as we like to call it pod show.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was listening to your show yesterday and I wanted to point out a few things.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So let's see if I can queue it up.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, here's the beginning of your show.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Geltis, here are Charlie, two, seven, two.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now let me jump ahead here a bit.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh yeah, here it is.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Where is the voice of the fan in mass media?

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know, it's always some idiot with blue and white paint on his face holding up a sign

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
or standing next to his mates with a, with a big letter on his belly, you know?

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Or it's the epitentiary here, shouted from the stands at the, at the rough, or the, or other, or opposing team players.

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But where is the voice of the fan?

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You don't really hear it.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You really don't.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So it makes a hell of a lot of sense at that's happening.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Cool to see it because there's no outlet whatsoever for him.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, so I got to this point and thought, what is Adam thinking?

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No voice for the fans?

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No outlet for them to be heard?

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Adam, you just have to look to family.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Your pod show family.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
At the skinny and sports, we give that outlet for the fan.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So whether you're wanting to talk about your favorite sport, team, athlete, or the game last night,

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
the skinny and sports can give you that voice.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can email us your comments at skinny and sports at gmail.com.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You can record audio comments and send them our way as well.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And the newest way is to call the t-sauce hotline.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
At 206-350-ts-o-s.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's t-s-o-s for the skinny and sports.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then you can look for your voice to be seen and heard at www.s skinny and sports.com.

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Alright Adam, now that we've got that out of the way, you can go back to your show,

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
knowing that your pod show family is looking out for you.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Have a good day.

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey buddy, thanks.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We got to figure out how to get you in both speakers.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Both earbuds at the same time.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, absolutely.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Of course.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What I meant was a little bit different.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because of course, skinny on sports, the fastest 10 minutes on your iPod,

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
gives the fan a voice.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I was thinking more along the lines of fans creating their own podcast.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I think that's not that you guys aren't fans.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I think there's places for all kinds of podcasts.

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And dude, I'm definitely going to call you guys up.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We should talk about that.

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What we can do, how we can facilitate even more fan interaction.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
A lot of the problems seem to be that whenever the fans get together

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and build great websites and fan-zene websites and do podcasts,

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
is that the clubs usually come down really hard on them for using their logos

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and trademarks and stuff like that.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's kind of like the music business in a way.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know, where it's all about the players,

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
it's all about the sponsors, the television rights,

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and somewhere, oh yeah, yeah, there's the people who pay for it all.

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That would be us, the fans, right?

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I think we're going to see some meltdowns all across the board.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And the more I think about it, in position I would talk about that last night,

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
there is such a meltdown on the way across the board.

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's, who was saying that to this guy, a friend of mine, Rob,

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
who lives in the Netherlands.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He used to be used to write for gossip magazines.

189
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It was like the one chill I had on the inside.

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He always worked at shitty rags that had no circulation,

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but at least like it gets some room or debunked a little bit.

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And he's now heavily into all kinds of online activities

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that involve SMSing, that's basically text messages

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that you send for a fee.

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And he has real valuable propositions for people.

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not going to get in digs.

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And it's okay, okay, he's doing porn, all right?

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So anyway, we talked about cross-promotion from television,

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
promoting URLs and how that would work and radio.

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And he said interestingly enough, he says that advertising on television

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
really doesn't give him a lot of traffic.

202
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He says because people who are inclined to go online

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
or to do something of that interactive nature,

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
basically aren't watching television.

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I thought that was, and this is a very small country,

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but it's a good country for testbed of how things will work,

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
because it's his own eco culture, it's own language and all that stuff.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So I thought that was pretty interesting.

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He said radio still does seem to work, but of course,

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's so ubiquitous, and they have such horrible traffic problems

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
in the Netherlands.

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Everyone spends at least two hours in their car every day,

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
if not more, sitting in traffic,

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
so they listen to a lot of radio.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And obviously he thinks that iPods are the next place

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
to advertise.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He feels that online advertising works much better.

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So if that's the vacuum that's being created in traditional media,

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you know, there's a lot to be afraid of,

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
or a lot of opportunities,

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
just a matter of how you take a look at it.

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
See a couple of emails here, Michael Grosch.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's see, as a former headbanging bedbanger's ball addict,

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I was surprised to hear about you from Steve Jobs

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and one of his keynotes.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I've been a happy subscriber to Delta Sierra Charlie since.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Tonight I've run into a little problem.

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
After syncing my subscriptions and iTunes,

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I found a repot of yesterday's episode and deleted it,

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
because I thought it would be the same as the regular episode,

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
what a fatal mistake.

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Unfortunately, I have no idea how to recover deleted episodes on iTunes.

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Re-syncing doesn't work,

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
hopefully you could point me to a solution,

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
which would probably be useful for other listeners of the DSC.

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Michael from Germany.

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay, first of all, excuse M.W.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Shapo, no, that's not what I'm looking for.

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Excuse M.W.

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
My French sucks.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I have like four things I know, I just say,

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and I pronounce them well, so I can get away with it.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mia Culpa, let's use that, not French, but it'll work.

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know how it happened, but I basically am still,

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I have the oldest crappiest upload production system in the world,

246
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and I'm keeping it that way for a specific reason,

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because the team that is now working on the Pod Show PDN,

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the Pod Cast delivery network,

249
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and everything that's going to be associated with that.

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I have to basically convince me to use their system.

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And until I do, it won't be good enough,

252
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and they have lots of issues to deal with with me,

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because there's migration, my feed,

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
my iTunes feed, where to stuff live.

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I mean, right now I'm uploading to three load balance servers,

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and I post a link on curry.com,

257
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and then I post the same thing again,

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and in radio, user land,

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
just to make it a little more complicated.

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And that's the actual feed that activates the iTunes feeds,

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and somehow, on copying, I copied a wrong link,

262
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and I had everything in there right,

263
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
it's just I copied the wrong enclosure link

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
into the user land upload interface,

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and it's crazy.

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Of course, that also kind of does show you

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that iTunes, as an aggregator, is technically broken,

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
because it should never download the same piece of content twice,

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and it did, it actually created two files.

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
With the same name, one with an appended,

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
was like a dash wand or something.

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That should basically never happen,

273
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
particularly if the bite sizes are the same,

274
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
which they were, so that doesn't seem to be working right.

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Now about deleting stuff in iTunes,

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
yeah, that's very dangerous.

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If you delete one episode,

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
it basically deletes your entire subscription,

279
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and where it does something funky,

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
really the only way I found to do it

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
is to completely delete the whole daily source code,

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
then re-subscribe to it,

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and you may want to subscribe

284
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
by using the link on dailysourcecode.com,

285
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the XML, the orange on white XML icon.

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If you copy that link,

287
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and you can go to, what is it on iTunes?

288
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think it's a bit just check.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think it's advanced, yeah,

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and then subscribe to podcast,

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and then paste that URL in there,

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and then you're still going to get fucked up shit

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
if I do it wrong,

294
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but it does remove one step from the loop,

295
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
which is the iTunes system,

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
which essentially scans all of the feeds periodically.

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't know if they've actually changed

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
to looking at a ping service,

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and now we talk to them about that a lot.

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And they may be looking at,

301
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't know,

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
when wintersoldweblogs.com,

303
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you also sold audio.weblogs.com,

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and I think that the short changes XML,

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that's basically the file that shows you what changes

306
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
have been made in the past X amount of time,

307
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and it always pops up empty for me,

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so I guess they're not supporting that anymore,

309
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
which is for obvious commercial reasons,

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
but I don't know.

311
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So now I don't,

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
they may be pulling it from ping.indepotter.com,

313
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
or ping.indepotter.org.

314
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's could be where they're getting it from.

315
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If they're doing pings,

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
but again, I don't know.

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Now I'll find out.

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They got some cool guys over there now,

319
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
who are dedicated to working on the podcasting

320
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and the iTunes music store,

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
so they'll definitely let me know.

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let me see a couple of sincere things.

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oops, hold on a second.

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The blackberry's going off.

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm going to check and see what that is.

326
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I have an extremely busy day today.

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Ah, okay, so we're late for this.

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's 12 to two.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Today, Patricia and I are going to test drive,

330
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
the Jaguar, the S-Type.

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
V6, turbohunker thing.

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Turbo dieselhunker thing.

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay, so we're going to be late for that.

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I was contemplating a sound seeing tour,

335
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
but I think I'm going to wait.

336
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
They don't have the really the car that we want.

337
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They have the car with the same engine and suspension,

338
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and all that stuff.

339
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But I think that when we go back and test drive,

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
the car that we're really interested in,

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
which has all the toys and all the cool bits in it.

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You know, probably at that point,

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
we might do a sound seeing tour.

344
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm pretty jazzed about it actually.

345
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Now, we won't be able to take the delivery of a car

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
for almost two months,

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
so we still have to see whether we're going to take one out of stock,

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
out of the showroom,

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
or if we're going to order one custom order it.

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've gotten some pros and cons,

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
email wise and feedback from people about the Jaguar,

352
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
saying that the typical stuff about English cars,

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and some other suggestions.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But I think I'm still pretty high on this,

355
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and depending on if it's not a total dog to drive,

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think we'll just get it,

357
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
because I don't drive here at all anyway.

358
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So, except to maybe go to the Farrowx Airport,

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
when I'm flying the 182.

360
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So, still looking for people who might have had some experience

361
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
with the Jaguar Diesel, Turbo Diesel,

362
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
regarding Bio Diesel, otherwise,

363
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
we're just all going to experiment together,

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
then aren't we?

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
More feedback.

366
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Hiya, this is from Brian Deamer.

367
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
From the Comic Geek Speed Podcast.

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
They're Brian.

369
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is Brian Deamer from the Comic Geek Speed Podcast.

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you

371
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
for inspiring me and my friends to do a podcast.

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Your daily dose of all things podcasting keeps me informed,

373
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and motivated to make our show better each day.

374
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I want to let your listeners know

375
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that it is possible to be successful in the world of podcasting.

376
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Our show started out in March,

377
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
just a small show with a few listeners.

378
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But by filling it with our passion for comic books,

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and trying our best to make it the best show we know how,

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
we now have more than 2,000 downloads every day.

381
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We are selling advertising that targets our audience,

382
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
since I owe.

383
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We are traveling around the US to comic conventions far and wide

384
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
to meet our listeners.

385
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Hell, we've never owned t-shirts.

386
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So if you really want to,

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and if you're willing to put in a lot of hard work,

388
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
you too can have a successful podcast.

389
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We owe it all to you, Adam.

390
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If not for your constant energy about this exciting new medium,

391
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
we wouldn't be where we are today.

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So have a great day and thanks so much.

393
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And by the way, if you're a fan of comic books,

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
or you're even curious about the joys of superheroes,

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
check us out at ComicGeekSpeak.com.

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hey, Brian. Thanks, buddy.

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I cannot accept all the credit you gave there.

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It sounds like you guys have been working really hard.

399
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And there you go.

400
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So you see what a couple of thousand subscribers can do

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
if you're, well, essentially,

402
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
if you're certainly if you're targeting some kind of nature,

403
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
basically whatever the frick you have passion about,

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
right, that's really, wow.

405
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I hate saying right after sentences.

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, that's so Silicon Valley.

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll get to that in a second.

408
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So you can see how it works.

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You know, if you're passionate about a topic,

410
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and I like the wrestling promo from yesterday as well,

411
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
you know, these are very targeted audiences.

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I mean, think of all, you know,

413
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
the, oh, man, any extreme sport,

414
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
anything that's narrower than the Daily Source Code, basically.

415
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think you can be very successful in because the audience is going to be so well known.

416
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Advertisers will, will hone you out.

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They will seek you out.

418
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm telling you, they're going after this because they realize it's a great place

419
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
to reach the audience.

420
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They just have no way of reaching because,

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
that's what they're not really watching television anymore.

422
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They're not really listening to the radio.

423
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And if they are, it's not quite working as well as it used to.

424
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So congratulations, guys.

425
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's fantastic.

426
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That is just fantastic.

427
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I love it.

428
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
About the right thing.

429
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Throughout Silicon Valley, I've noticed.

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Whenever you talk to a technologist,

431
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
someone who really knows this stuff usually will do this,

432
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
there's this, this habit of people saying,

433
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
well, you know, I'll give an example.

434
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, the RSS feed, of course,

435
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
will update through the dynamically generated court, right?

436
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And they always end the sentence with the right,

437
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
which is,

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
it gives a non-technical people a very easy way to say,

439
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
oh, yeah, right.

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But I find it highly annoying.

441
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I do find myself often saying,

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
no, I don't think that's right.

443
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But that's incorrect.

444
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But the danger is you start taking that shit

445
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
over yourself and you start saying,

446
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
oh, God, I hate doing that.

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm the chameleon of talk when it comes to that.

448
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I always, you know,

449
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm still still struggling,

450
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
very hard not to slip into the magic vibe over here.

451
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The Madonna vibe of talking with the English accent,

452
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
which is not fake, it's not,

453
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
her accent is not fake.

454
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's so easy if you live here to slip into it.

455
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's just,

456
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it's a fascinating way of using the English language.

457
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It really is so much nicer than,

458
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
then what I grew up with,

459
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
so much richer in description to be honest.

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Gabrielle Moreno,

461
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
this is the email I was waiting for.

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Adam, been a fan for several months.

463
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Thanks for playing some country.

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I would not complain if you play more of it.

465
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I am a jazz in the country fan.

466
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
He he he.

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Anyone wants to know if,

468
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
there's a way to buy pot-sake music other than through iTunes?

469
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well, yeah, of course.

470
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Most of the artists have sales mechanisms or deals with places like CDB

471
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
be set up on their own websites,

472
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
which you can get to from the pot-sake music network.

473
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And, well,

474
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
they're,

475
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
there possibly could be something in the very near future

476
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
in the form of an unlabel that might,

477
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
might answer your question a little more,

478
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
so,

479
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
this one's for you,

480
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
another country song,

481
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
this is Amy Dallas.

482
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's just a long-label,

483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
quite a tragedy.

484
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Same time,

485
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
same channel,

486
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and you're hosting down,

487
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and watch the show.

488
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's a revix,

489
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it's running out with a broken heart,

490
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and I'm afraid,

491
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
making it time away.

492
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's trapped in myself from the flame,

493
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
oh,

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
hey,

495
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
it's gonna be kidding,

496
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
there's gonna be tears,

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and I'm not trying to drown

498
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

499
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
but you don't want to meet

500
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
us up the shows,

501
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
just starting,

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
running out with a broken heart,

503
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

504
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

506
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

507
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

508
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

509
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and I'm in a couple of fears,

and I'm in a couple of fears,

603
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Looking hard,

604
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Running out with the broken heart.

605
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

606
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah.

607
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Right now.

608
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah.

609
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah.

610
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah.

611
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

612
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah.

613
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah.

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

615
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah.

616
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

617
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah.

618
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Amy Dally.

619
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I presume it's Dally,

620
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
D-A-L-L-E-Y Friday night.

621
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
From the Podsate Music Network,

622
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
a little bit of country for you, Robotta.

623
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Uh...

624
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Music.podshow.com.

625
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Now, so here we are.

626
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And the Patricia Knight talked about her coming on the show more just last night.

627
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And I said, I'm going to go to the show.

628
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And then I just saw her drive off in the car.

629
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Did you just post it?

630
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hold on.

631
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Let me just call her.

632
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Let's see if she has her mobile honor.

633
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll see if I can do this.

634
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I think that's it.

635
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Let's see if I've got everything hooked up right.

636
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
If so, it will function.

637
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Come on Skype.

638
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Do your thing, baby.

639
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Right.

640
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So far, pretty disappointing.

641
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Come on.

642
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Why isn't that working?

643
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Connecting?

644
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That was wrong here.

645
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm on the right network.

646
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
See if I have the right number in there.

647
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let me see.

648
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Hmm.

649
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Well, this is not working out the way I plan.

650
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Let me try one more time.

651
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Why isn't Skype out just working?

652
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Man, I'm going to go off on another tire.

653
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I can feel it.

654
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I guess not.

655
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
All right.

656
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Told you leave it for what it is.

657
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Another thing that I got a lot of quite a lot of feedback and comments on.

658
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And in fact, over the past couple of weeks, it seemed to seem so intensified.

659
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Is the naming convention and I wasn't understanding what the problem was.

660
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
People are saying, hey, however you name your show.

661
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Please change it so that I can actually see which episode is going to play on my iPod.

662
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Because the iPod essentially takes this whole title and you got it.

663
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It abbreviates it or it gives you a dot dot dot dot dot.

664
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think sometimes it'll scroll if you put your if you mouse wheel over to the episode.

665
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It'll scroll so you can see what it is.

666
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But of course, my episode numbers come at the very end.

667
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I'm thinking, that doesn't sound right.

668
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
My episode.

669
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
In fact, I name my my shows.

670
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
D.S.C. Dash episode number dash year dash month dash day.

671
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And I couldn't figure it out until finally I had a closing.

672
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't usually look at my own.

673
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
My own pod.

674
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm subscribed to it and I looked at it.

675
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And it doesn't represent the ID three tags.

676
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The actual file itself.

677
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It represents the post that that was made.

678
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So the podcast is basically named or I guess.

679
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Let me see.

680
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
This is an interesting question.

681
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Anyway, so what shows up in iTunes on the iPod is from what I post on the website.

682
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Not what I put in the ID three tags.

683
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That was pretty surprising because yeah, right there.

684
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I say daily source code for day.

685
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You know, it was like, we guess they would have been for Wednesday,

686
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
November 2nd, 2005, 2007 too.

687
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So basically all you see on the iPod is daily source code for dot dot dot.

688
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, that of course sucks.

689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Let me see if it.

690
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I mean, look at the original file here for a second.

691
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I think we can do it like this.

692
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Wow.

693
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, they actually name the file.

694
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, that's interesting.

695
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
iTunes renames the file.

696
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Now, let's see what's in the ID three tags.

697
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Don't have that didn't change, please.

698
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's let me see the ID three tags say.

699
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I have to open up in quick time, I guess.

700
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Hold on one second.

701
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This is kind of interesting.

702
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay.

703
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let's look at the ID three tags for it.

704
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Read my God.

705
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Wow.

706
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I had no idea.

707
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

708
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So that's really interesting.

709
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And at the same time, I don't know if I like that.

710
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So when you get a podcast from a through iTunes,

711
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and then it sucks it into iTunes,

712
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
it basically repopulates all of the ID three tags in your font.

713
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That is not right.

714
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I mean, so yeah, I know how to work around it,

715
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
but that's basically changing my content.

716
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay.

717
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So what I'll do today is you've probably already noticed.

718
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'll post it differently so that you can actually see it on your iPod.

719
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And of course, I'll get all kinds of people angry at me

720
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
because I changed the name convention.

721
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But this is pretty important stuff.

722
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I had no idea that iTunes did that,

723
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and I'm just finding this out.

724
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Okay.

725
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So basically, I have to put, I have to change the way I name them

726
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in the posts to the weblog and to the podcast feed,

727
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
which I'll do.

728
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Pretty interesting stuff.

729
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Something else that happened.

730
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, Skype out is working, I think.

731
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What's working?

732
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Hello?

733
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
No, I don't hear anything.

734
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Hello?

735
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Hello?

736
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Hello?

737
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hello?

738
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Hey, baby.

739
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
There you go.

740
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Don't let yourself go.

741
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh, I couldn't hear you.

742
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I wanted to call you on the show.

743
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, I mean, I'm in the car.

744
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
In the car.

745
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah.

746
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
For some reason, I can't get you on the mixing board, either.

747
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Whatever.

748
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Um, I mean, the car has to put things to it.

749
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Do you know that?

750
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, I know it's dangerous, dear.

751
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Please be very careful.

752
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We're driving off the left side.

753
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, I, I, I want to say that we've missed you on the show

754
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and you drove off.

755
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, I have to get new, do I?

756
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay.

757
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
There's a peanut here, someone.

758
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We have the teenagers hungry here.

759
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay.

760
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Well, see you later, then we'll go test drive.

761
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll be back in five minutes.

762
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay.

763
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, yeah.

764
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
If you're back in five, then we can still talk.

765
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Okay.

766
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Love you.

767
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Love you.

768
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Okay.

769
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Hmm.

770
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't know.

771
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
For some reason, the mixer didn't work.

772
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
All right.

773
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Okay.

774
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh, yeah.

775
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That's right.

776
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
CC Chapman had something pretty cool to say about the upcoming podcast

777
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Expo.

778
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, I'm curious.

779
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
This is Scott from Anchorage, Alaska.

780
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Listen.

781
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Wait a minute.

782
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That's not CC.

783
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's Scott.

784
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay.

785
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm sorry.

786
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Here we go.

787
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I was thinking about all the great artists and talent that's over there at the pod safe

788
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Music Network and I was thinking, hmm.

789
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You know, all this needs to be packaged up.

790
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Maybe Showcase.

791
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
How about a pod show polusa?

792
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That's right.

793
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I think it would be a fantastic idea.

794
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Not only would it support and pump up the independent music artists that are out there.

795
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But it also demonstrated the music industry.

796
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
How many people are listening to podcasts and listening to independent artists that are

797
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
on most podcasts?

798
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So I'm all for you trying to make that happen.

799
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Let me know what I can do.

800
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And look forward to going to a pod show polusa this summer.

801
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Take care of yourself and keep podcasting from Anchorage, Alaska.

802
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This has got Sloan at the Alaska pod show.

803
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Right on Scott.

804
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay.

805
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So that was a pretty good point.

806
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Although, you know, the problem there is if you want to package up a concert tour.

807
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It has a lot of money involved in that to get that going.

808
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And who knows what kind of ticket sales we'd have.

809
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I guess it would really had a great way of promoting it across the network.

810
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Well, actually, I think it might actually work.

811
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I have to think about it.

812
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But we are taking small, small, tiny little steps.

813
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And one of them is what CC is going to tell you about.

814
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The podcasters are coming.

815
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
The podcasters are coming.

816
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The podcasters are coming.

817
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The podcasters are coming.

818
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey, Adam.

819
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's CC from accidenthash.com.

820
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
How's it going, Matt?

821
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Haven't talked to you in a while.

822
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And I want to talk to you listeners for just a minute to let them know about something very, very cool.

823
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
The podcasters exposed next week.

824
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We all know that Friday and Saturday.

825
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Well, everybody's getting in on Thursday, right?

826
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And we need something to get everyone together to kick off the whole expo right.

827
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And what's that going to be?

828
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It's going to be an unofficial kickoff party.

829
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And we're calling it give love a chance.

830
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
We're doing a little acoustic party.

831
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Everybody is welcome.

832
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And we're going to have two of the hottest podsafe artists out there.

833
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We're going to have chance playing an acoustic set.

834
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And then the number one pod played artist out there.

835
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Brother loves flying all the way in from New York City to rock the place down.

836
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I can't wait.

837
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's going to be a nice cool upbeat set, but acoustic set.

838
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Brother love.

839
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I know we're going to pull him back and make him rock the house a little acoustic.

840
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So I'm encouraging everybody.

841
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We're going to have a sign-up form very soon because we know we're going to pack this thing out.

842
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Nine o'clock at the Marriott details to follow.

843
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
There will be posters.

844
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
There will be flyers.

845
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You can't miss it.

846
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So when you get into town on Thursday, look up around the Marriott.

847
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know, they're going to have the little screens everywhere.

848
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And I'll swing on by and add them.

849
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
We'll make sure you're on the guest list.

850
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So if I when you parachute in and you get all your your hos and your limos and everybody else and your whole

851
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
archeological coming in, we'll make sure this room free at the door.

852
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Details to follow.

853
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If anyone has any questions from my accent at hash.com, I will have the latest information.

854
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I appreciate it.

855
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And I appreciate this.

856
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Show being put on by the podshow podcast network and the podsafe music network.

857
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Helping me make this a reality.

858
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So peace man, play some songs.

859
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And I'll talk to you soon.

860
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But it's all good home fries.

861
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Absolutely.

862
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Very cool.

863
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's Thursday night, which kind of bones me out because I was planning on arriving Thursday afternoon.

864
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I wasn't actually planning on going up until Friday.

865
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
If I can get the bitches, the hose and the limos all set up, you know.

866
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm afraid to go now.

867
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I really am because inevitably I'm going to piss somebody off by not having time to talk to.

868
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because everybody is sending me messages.

869
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hey, you know, I'll catch up with you at the expo.

870
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Man, I don't want to like, you know, hold court and talk to people.

871
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That's sucks.

872
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You know, I just want to, maybe I should go and disguise.

873
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
There you go.

874
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I did check it coming for the great disguise.

875
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, five foot 17 of me.

876
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
CC just sent an email, internal email here at podshow.

877
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Songs reported played on the podsafe music network.

878
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
8,060.

879
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
My god.

880
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Fantastic.

881
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Over 8,000 songs played from the podsafe music network.

882
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That's a lot of airtime.

883
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's a lot of songs played, man.

884
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
That is fantastic.

885
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
See, we have,

886
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh, yeah.

887
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh, man.

888
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
We have 1,000.

889
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Just thousands of podcasters registered thousands of artists.

890
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Thousands of songs uploaded.

891
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
This is fantastic.

892
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That's really, really cool.

893
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That's great.

894
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Paul, to UCC, and of course, the podshow podsafe music podcasters.

895
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You can find out more about them all at music.podshow.com or podsafe music network.com.

896
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And it's funny.

897
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Because CC actually says, you'll dig this in one of his email subjects.

898
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And that reminded me that someone,

899
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Actually, a couple people pointed out to me that I'm on dig.com.

900
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And yesterday, apparently, someone was incredibly brilliant.

901
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And went to one of our investor's websites.

902
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
A quiet capital and found the podshow address and telephone number,

903
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
which is no problem.

904
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's like a phone listing.

905
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And then, and here's Adam Curry's personal phone number.

906
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And so people were sending me message like, wow, man,

907
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you must be really bummed out.

908
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And that really sucks.

909
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm like, what are they talking about?

910
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I looked at the number.

911
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And it is one of my phone numbers.

912
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And it probably picks up with an answering machine

913
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
that has my voice on it.

914
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But it's like, it's a prepaid, tea mobile from a couple months ago.

915
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't even have to, I'm pissed off about it.

916
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Because I don't have the sim card.

917
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You know, I really wanted to play some of the messages

918
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
that folks had left on it for me.

919
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But what was interesting is that people see,

920
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
you know, that's like that some kind of intrusion.

921
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm like, no, you know, it's like,

922
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think everyone can have my phone number.

923
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
As long as I have your phone number,

924
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
have you in my address book,

925
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and you have your caller ID switched on.

926
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Because my phone actually doesn't ring.

927
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
If you don't have caller ID,

928
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
if you're not recognized in my phone book,

929
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and then you just go to voice mail,

930
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and I'll catch up with you later.

931
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You know, it's funny how that's flipped around,

932
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
where the real personal contact happens through email.

933
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It doesn't happen through the telephone anymore.

934
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
In fact, my phone barely rings at all.

935
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If only for a prior agreed to time to talk with someone.

936
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's all email instant message.

937
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's, uh, it's changing my friends.

938
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It really is a changing.

939
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
All right.

940
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Here are the couple promos.

941
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I promise you that I had lined up.

942
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hey Adam, it's Aaron Chapman here from Vancouver BC.

943
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I love the daily source code,

944
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and I listen all the time.

945
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Listen, I've got a promo here.

946
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It would be awesome if you give it a spin for me.

947
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Check it out.

948
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Send me, me, send me.

949
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Recte, alvi.

950
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Tent, podcast, text, look, again, again, again.

951
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Radio, right now.

952
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The other side of my guy, Tentzoi,

953
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Interess I'm a long guy,

954
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I often change my program.

955
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Orvi, Kai Devi.

956
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Esperadding, where are you from?

957
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Radio Verda.

958
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Lavocho, the Esperanto.

959
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Radio Verda.com.

960
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Did you get all that?

961
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That was in the International Language Esperanto.

962
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
In case you haven't heard of Esperanto,

963
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
it's a constructed language that's extremely easy to learn.

964
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It was designed to bridge people's cultures around the world,

965
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and it's been around since the 1800s,

966
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
so there's a small but vibrant community out there.

967
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Radio Verda, which means green radio or green ray or beam,

968
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
was launched in 98 and was the first independent international

969
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
radio program entirely in Esperanto entirely on the internet.

970
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Since then, it's been a small, on again, off again project,

971
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
but it's recently been relaunched as a podcast,

972
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
which you could find at Radio Verda.com

973
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
in large part from inspiration from you, my friend.

974
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So thanks very much for that, and all your great work.

975
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'll keep on listening, especially on my new iPod,

976
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
if it ever gets here.

977
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Cheers Adam, take care.

978
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Hot show should only be enjoyed under the supervision

979
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
of a podcasting professional,

980
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
warning, do not attempt this at home.

981
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yeah!

982
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Adam Curry, got a couple of quick questions for you

983
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to short plug for my show.

984
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's kindergarten.

985
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The groggy job is show.

986
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That's available at groggyjovith.tv.

987
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah, what's up with German raygays?

988
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It just made it as a scene like a lot of the raygays.

989
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's available online today on the podcast,

990
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
if you're sitting at work another similar network's like it.

991
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Now they all can seem to come from Germany.

992
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Maybe there's something going on there,

993
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't know about.

994
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Maybe there's something you know about it.

995
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm not really sure.

996
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Anyways, I would like to see if you could put out a casting call

997
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
for more raygays just in general.

998
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm for the podcast music network.

999
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I haven't taken out jam and incorporated power,

1000
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
step for his back-to-luncher.

1001
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I've been spinning them.

1002
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I've been really digging it.

1003
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'd like to see if we can get some more up in there.

1004
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Also, it was interesting for Cisco to be before the last one.

1005
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I noticed how very similar there are two

1006
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and an answer down the place

1007
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
that really feels warm in the sun,

1008
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
cool in the breeze.

1009
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Columbus and Grant Boy,

1010
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
that's about a red light district up around there,

1011
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
isn't it?

1012
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Anyway, is this an SSH department

1013
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
on my show from a longer winded form

1014
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
out of Gavin and John,

1015
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and having it all in?

1016
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Into the more of the morning coffee talks show

1017
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
with music and me,

1018
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and having some fun with guests and stuff like that.

1019
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Perhaps some of you,

1020
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
this is one more stuff by groggyjava.tv

1021
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
for a cup of Joe.

1022
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Anyways, got to run.

1023
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
You will do.

1024
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Thanks for the time,

1025
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and have a good one, dude.

1026
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You will.

1027
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Right.

1028
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Let me see Columbus and Grant,

1029
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and I have to do a sound scene tour of that.

1030
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And today, the source code for Thursday,

1031
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
to more, of course,

1032
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
to be the thank God,

1033
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
is Friday, and we'll have our regular party schedule

1034
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and I'm looking forward to that.

1035
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Another bit of music I picked up off

1036
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
of the Pot set music network this morning,

1037
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
just going to the home page,

1038
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and I was listening to the first five songs that come up.

1039
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Kind of like this one.

1040
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And Lynn.

1041
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
This is from Renalbo.

1042
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The way Loves meant to be,

1043
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
actually it's an EP as part of the scene

1044
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
of a daily source code.

1045
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It turns everybody on.

1046
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
While I try to cheat my distance,

1047
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
everything is the same for everyone.

1048
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's about the door,

1049
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
the competition has begun.

1050
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm looking out the window for a sign,

1051
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you'll never pick me up all the time.

1052
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The queen insisting by their past relationships.

1053
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
They were broken.

1054
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But it keeps you on the ground.

1055
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It just keeps you hanging on.

1056
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You just can't let go.

1057
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's just leaving it alone.

1058
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It tracks us all around.

1059
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It tracks us all around.

1060
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It tracks us all around.

1061
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It tracks us all around.

1062
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It tracks us all around.

1063
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It tracks us all around.

1064
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It tracks us all around.

1065
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It tracks us all around.

1066
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It tracks us all around.

1067
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It tracks us all around.

1068
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It tracks us all around.

1069
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It tracks us all around.

1070
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It tracks us all around.

1071
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It tracks us all around.

1072
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It tracks us all around.

1073
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It tracks us all around.

1074
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It tracks us all around.

1075
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It tracks us all around.

1076
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm not going to go out on a limb here,

1077
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
and suggest that the artist's name is the scene

1078
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and the title of the song is Anne Lynn.

1079
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Not the other way around.

1080
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The wonders of ID3 tags.

1081
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Sorry for being such an idiot.

1082
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
PWB just sent me an email.

1083
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
He was listening to yesterday's source code.

1084
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
He said that I was trying to hear

1085
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
that I was trying to track down a ground loop home,

1086
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and he goes through, this typical PWB.

1087
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
He'll go through all the different steps

1088
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
until he narrows it down to one thing.

1089
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It turns out that the real solution

1090
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
is to make sure your computer that you're recording on

1091
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
is plugged into the same power circuit

1092
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
that your outboard gear is.

1093
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That's pretty interesting.

1094
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I have no desire to rewire this thing.

1095
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I got no desire to rewire.

1096
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Definitely not.

1097
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay. I think I've stalled enough.

1098
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I can't get Patricia on the show today, so I'll have to do it tomorrow.

1099
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But I'll trapper.

1100
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So she can't leave the house.

1101
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
She had to leave the house today early at 10.

1102
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
She went to see her new cardiologist here in the UK,

1103
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and I'm happy to report that we have a very healthy

1104
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
bouncy baby girl.

1105
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
She's doing great, so that was great news.

1106
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay, dailysourcecode.com is where you can find this podcast.

1107
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
We can always download directly from the website

1108
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
or even better. You might want to subscribe to the show

1109
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
in iPod or Lemon, which by the way

1110
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
is going to change its name pretty soon.

1111
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Maybe I'll tell you more about that tomorrow.

1112
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And also there's iTunes links

1113
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
so you can subscribe to it with iTunes just by clicking on the link.

1114
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And for feedback, fired off to Adam at Curried.com.

1115
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I can't say it enough.

1116
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I'd really, really, really appreciate it.

1117
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
If you could add the appropriate ID3 tags

1118
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and stick it up on a server somewhere and just send me the link.

1119
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So I don't get too filled up here on the Gmail.

1120
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And that's it, really.

1121
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Okay.

1122
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
If you got anything cool for tomorrow's weekend kickoff celebration,

1123
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
send it off to me.

1124
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I definitely love playing the crazy stuff.

1125
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You know that.

1126
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And I will be back tomorrow on the thank god it's edition.

1127
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Thank god it's Friday edition of the Daily Source Code.

1128
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Take care y'all.

1129
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Another pod show podcast.

1130
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Stick it in your ear.
