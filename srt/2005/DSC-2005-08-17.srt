1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Shia Charley 2-2-4 and good morning once again from Berkeley, California.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We are in the Megaspiti Ford Taurus once again.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let me just check and see that it looks like everything's recording.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A little low on battery on the, let me see.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh my microphone, so this may be the last,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
instantly the Taurus roared to life.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This may be the last shot I have it recording on this, on this set of batteries.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Still at the, oh, that's how it's turned.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Still at the Claremont Resort.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And still pretending to be on vacation, which of course isn't really true.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The girls are still kind of on vacation, although yesterday, oops,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
on the, my bag on the floor here, and so it doesn't.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Crash off.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hold on.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Going to the gate to the hotel.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good morning.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you, God.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, not yet.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, thank you.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, we got two more days before we're checking out.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, yesterday Patricia Ankristina and Marta Ron's wife went shopping

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
for some stuff for the apartment here in San Francisco.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now, of course, I'm going to be using the apartment myself

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
namely by myself.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Of course, Patricia and hopefully Christina will come along once in a while.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
See Claremont.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's where I want to go left.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, they were really thinking about ease of use and just my personality

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
when looking for furniture and they bought some kind of,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I haven't seen a picture of it.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's been described to me.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I think it's one of these big monster mega couches

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that may even have the cup holders don't write in.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Not quite sure if they got me that version or not.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I know it has a reclining section.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, I'm completely jazzed about that.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like my Albundi couch.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, that's going to be, that's going to be very cool.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But they really spent a whole day.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Man, they should have done a sound scene tour

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
because first of all, we had the cars.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since I had part in my car at the apartment

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and we took Ron's car to our board meeting,

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
we had a boat hold on this is yellow and we stopped.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Which was on Sandhill Road.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The famous for its venture capital firms and that's where

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
both the Clienter Perkins and Sequoia capital are located.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, we had to drive down there, not down.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, then they had to find a car to rent.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I think they had the car.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
They drove two blocks and they went in somewhere

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and immediately the car got towed.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then they had to go get the car back

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and it sounded like they had quite an adventure.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, we really didn't see them again until like 9.30.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because they were just all over town getting stuff.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, that was cool.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, for them, that wasn't really much of a...

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, this was planned.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This was definitely planned.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That we're going to be working on the apartment.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now, I also ordered a whole bunch, or Patricia,

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I both ordered a whole bunch of stuff from J.C. Penny.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know, like sheets and pillows.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And yeah, I can't get an answer out of them as to when they're going to deliver it.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, I don't think that's going to happen before we go.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We're scheduled to go back on Friday.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I'm sure I'll be back in maybe only two weeks time.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, hopefully we'll have a lot of the stuff set up.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And you're just building up a household real quick

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because a lot goes into that.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You know, you need stuff like trash cans and bleach and iron.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So, I'm sure there's plenty of stuff that we haven't thought of

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that they'll have to pick up next time I'm out here.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But it's going to be very livable.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's for sure.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, yesterday we had our...

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It wasn't really...

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, I guess it was a board meeting.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Probably board update is more like it because we just received our financing.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that you know,

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
just that you normally talk about in a board meeting

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that we couldn't do in this particular case.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But, you know what?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I gotta tell you, we had our plan and we came out here

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and we started talking to venture capital firms and we targeted the ones

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that we wanted to work with.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And, you know, we got what we wanted.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I am very impressed with, you know,

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
with the people that we're working with.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Particularly Randy Kamazar, Ray Lane,

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ramshiram,

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Chandor, Marquami.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I mean, these are people of access to just unbelievable

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
networks of people and companies.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And, you know, phone calls are made and stuff gets done.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And, that's... that is really impressive,

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
but also very exciting.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Because there's, you know,

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we just ask for stuff, you know, you ask for something

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and it gets worked on, it gets done.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And that's, I love that.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And we've been doing a lot of stuff.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And a lot of stuff that we've been talking about

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
over the past year, really,

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but certainly over the past half year,

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
about things that need to happen.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I think that we're going to have some good news about

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
bandwidth, delivery, and hosting for all podcasters,

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think we're going to be able to do some really cool stuff there.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was just skimming through the ping page yesterday,

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the latest podcasters listening to what people were saying,

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and more and more I'm hearing anyone who has,

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
like anywhere between two and 500 listeners

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to their show subscribers or downloaders.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, that starts to run into real cost on the bandwidth,

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
on the downloading side.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I think we're going to have some great news

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
about that in the very near future.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Also, as promised, putting our money

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and our resources where our mouth is on indiepotter.org,

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that is the directory for me known as iPod.org.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You may have already seen that the performance

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
of the servers doing better,

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but all the stuff that we really talked about,

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
more tools for node managers,

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
more ways to feature their node, their category,

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
the better access to the homepage of indiepotter.org,

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
which right now is really just a set of scripts

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
that I put in place that is kind of working.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Easier ways to delegate sub nodes, all of that stuff.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We're working on it, and there's three people

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
not really starting to plan out and map out

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
what we're going to do with that.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It doesn't happen overnight.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's not like a big bundle of cash

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and smart people show up at your doorstep,

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and then everything's fixed.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There's actual work that has to be done.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But we've got the resources,

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and I'm extremely excited about the work

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that's going on.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The office is great.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's small, and this is our temporary office

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
until we get an offer accepted

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
on one of the three places that we're looking for.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's all south of markets,

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
so it's in this nice area of San Francisco

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that's kind of young and upcoming.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A lot of residential,

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
like on the right way.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
A lot of residential neighborhoods are being built,

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
which is where the new baseball stadium is.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's just, I don't know, I like it down there.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a good vibe.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
By the way, thank you for everyone who consulted

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
either Wikipedia or the CIA World Factbook for me.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It seems that there's about the lower 700,000 people

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that live in San Francisco.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's funny, because for East Coast,

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
there's like myself and Ron and Brian,

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and some of the other guys.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's like New York on a Sunday morning at 6am.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is totally luxury.

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There's no traffic out here.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's nothing.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Although I do recall 10 years ago

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
when we had think new ideas,

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
our professional services company,

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and we were doing a lot of work for.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
See, we had work out here.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We came at a Silicon Graphics building,

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
some kind, I don't remember what it was.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A web presence, I'm sure,

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm reaching back to grab my,

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
perhaps some money for the toll.

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And they've got so many toll booths,

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and no traffic.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Love that.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's foggy again today.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Can barely see the Bay Bridge,

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
or the tops of the Bay Bridge through the fog.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yesterday, it turned out to be beautiful,

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
just nice and sunny,

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and it's never really cold.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
At night, it does get chilly,

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
but I haven't worn a jacket or a coat.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I probably should start thinking about that.

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know if it's the weather changes significantly,

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
at all.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I've been led to believe that there's not a lot of change.

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Good morning.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you.

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm led to believe that there's not a lot

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
of real seasonal change in the weather.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I wonder if there's more sunny periods.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, it's either way.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, a second, I'm getting squeezed here.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All right, I'm ready.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So it is 10, 15 right now,

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and I'm obviously I'm driving in.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The girls are taking it easy.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We weren't back at the hotel until about midnight.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've had a great dinner, though,

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
at 21st Amendment,

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
which is on,

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
what is that on?

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is that on?

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Brian?

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Or Folsom?

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think Brian?

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's a lot of good food in San Francisco.

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They were immediately saying,

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the food out here, the restaurants are just great,

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
which is true.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A lot of good influences from different countries,

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
just good cooking in general.

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So they're going to come in later.

223
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Christina was such a trooper.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So here's almost 15-year-olds.

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We're birthdays on the 27th,

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
so just was it nine days from now, ten days from now.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's kind of boring for 15-year-old

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to have to go furniture shopping,

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but I think she's really held up

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and helped Patricia and Marta out

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
with jumping on mattresses,

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
whatever trouble they could get into.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But as a reward today,

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think they're going to go to Union Square

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and go do some serious chick shopping.

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sure they'll enjoy that,

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and Christina always loves a little shopping trip.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And so we'll meet up at the office later.

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I think we're going to have a little hangout

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
at the end of the day.

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Michael Butler should be coming over.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He hasn't seen the office yet, and of course,

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
he's a part of the company, Steve Gilmore.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm feeling one or two other folks may pop up

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to get on our radar screen out here.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I'm going to have to be in by 1030,

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
which I think I'll make no problem.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It really is only a 15-minute ride from the cross to the bay.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
For a time magazine interview that Ron and I are doing together,

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and I think there's some interview after that,

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
because obviously the news of the funding,

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
caught attention of the press,

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and podcasts and continues to grow.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It continues to be a lot of excitement,

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
new listeners coming in every single day,

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
enjoying just all this new stuff.

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And it really is.

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
As I said, I was just skimming through the ping page yesterday,

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
just listening to new stuff that's popped up,

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and it's so amazing.

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There is so much great content, different content,

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you know, funny stuff, serious stuff.

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You know, I think we're going to need more,

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
something we're talking about yesterday.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If I could really have my brothers,

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
if I could push all the buttons,

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and I'm hoping I could do some of that,

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
we need more atom curries,

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and I'm not saying,

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
cloning me,

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm saying,

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
we need more people who can guide new listeners through the landscape.

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So, you know,

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have my own taste,

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
both in pot-safe music,

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and podcasts that I like,

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and I like to turn people onto that.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, you know, when you listen to the daily source code,

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
normally when we're doing a normal source code,

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
which we'll commence again on Monday,

281
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and we're back at the cottage,

282
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and got everything up and rolling.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I'm back in front of my compressor limiter,

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and I have time.

285
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, I like to roll out promos from shows that interest me.

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We need different guides for different types of stuff,

287
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and I've actually been thinking about

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
maybe we can position some of the pod squad.

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You know,

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I think we should do that for new listeners that come in.

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Michael Butler,

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
he represents a whole different set of podcasts

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that was really involved in rock pod-safe music.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But not just that, you know,

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
he's had some fabulous guests on recently,

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and he also points to a lot of great podcasts.

297
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You know, I'd like to see Steve Gilmore,

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
guide people towards

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
technology and business podcasts that are great

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to listen to and subscribe to.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And, you know,

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Madge Weinstein is already doing this with Q-Potter.

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So, I think that there's, you know,

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
there's something there that

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that we should work on,

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
because, again,

307
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
we're all about bringing the listeners in,

308
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
getting listeners interested

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and helping them find their way.

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So, I do that's just something that I've

311
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
been thinking about.

312
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Trying to figure out how we could

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
make it even easier for

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
more listeners who come in

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to get what they want,

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
enjoy what they want.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And, obviously,

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
if they're not hearing what they like

319
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and they want to do with themselves,

320
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
have an easy path for that as well.

321
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So, we're,

322
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm off the Bay Bridge now.

323
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm amazed at how I've been doing

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
without the GPS.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I really am.

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's see.

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So, now I want to get off

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the fifth street exit,

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
which I think this is it.

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So, I'm driving right by

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the apartment,

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
which overlooks this off-ramp of the Bay Bridge.

333
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think what I'm supposed to do here

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
is hang a sharp left

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
on the fifth street.

336
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, this is it.

337
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Ah, still lots and lots and lots

338
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
of homeless.

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There was something on the news

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
that I was,

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
yeah, and that's up on Brian.

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Perfect. There's something on the news.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There's a guy who started a company out here

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and it made me chuckle.

345
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And he basically is paying homeless people

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
who normally hold up signs saying,

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
you know, help me,

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
or need money,

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
or whatever.

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He's paying them to hold up advertising signs.

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I thought that was such a brilliant idea.

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know, everybody wins.

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The advertiser wins.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He wins is the intermediary

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and the homeless person has a job.

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I thought that was such a brilliant idea.

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know what the legality is of it,

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
but I thought it was,

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
yeah, just that, brilliant.

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Something to be said for that.

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And that's going to kind of wrap it up for today.

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
As I am now,

363
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
just about to pull up to the temp office.

364
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Here I'm Brian.

365
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You've successfully driven in with me

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and you've guided me into work.

367
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So I appreciate you hanging out with me

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
as I'm just about the past third street.

369
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So, you know, you've heard of court TVs

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
gavled the gavled coverage.

371
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This was daily source codes

372
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
ignition to shut down coverage.

373
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay, let me just roll it right up here.

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Parking fun of

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
a typical San Francisco hippie VW bus.

376
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And that's it.

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I will undoubtedly,

378
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
if I have batteries, etc,

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
talk to you tomorrow.

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Thanks again.

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And,

382
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
17, not almost 18 minutes.

383
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
All right, take care. Bye-bye.
