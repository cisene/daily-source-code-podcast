00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta Sierra Charley 2-6-7

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You know the weird guy in the corner of the office who always has his headphones on?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's you!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hud choke

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There are no secrets!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Only information you don't get out of!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Adam Curry

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Do the next generation radio content in my ears

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I like to think I'm flying into this jerk

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Just take it!

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hit in the hump at full speed, it is Wednesday, October 26, 2005

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good morning everybody from Yes!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not a sunny northern california, the first day is actually raining in the morning

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I mean like real rain drops you fall on on my head stuff, you know?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yesterday we had a bit of that, but today it's foggy cloudy

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Finally I know what to wear

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's just gonna be shit today, that's easy

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's just our last day of the day

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Time now 3 minutes before 9 in the morning of Wednesday, 26

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Major friggin bummer

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All flights full until Saturday

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Put you of course will have made my trip out here almost a full two weeks

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And that means I've got to do laundry tonight

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I only had 10 days worth of underwear

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's okay because whisking from Reese makes it so fluffy

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's so fluffy and soft

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Another source code ready for you and we've got it full of feedback today

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know what it is but all of a sudden everyone started sending feedback

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Some of it based on actually most of the based on this show which is nice

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's all the less talking I got to do

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
By the way, some of this feedback is definitely not appropriate for a young year

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So if you're listening to this on speakers you may want to take that into consideration

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But it is very fun

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Even got some video feedback actually a piece of video I want to share with you

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Which would be kind of a theater of the mind thing

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And obviously some appropriate positive music

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Started off though once again a dub from mash up town didn't he just as he sent me

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What was it hate mug?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which is IDC's mashup

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Watch you by mashuptown.com

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
A new day and other morning after

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Leaning back on my chair and a greasy spoon cafeteria

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Last night was some bit later in a snow

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Power wave again way back in the light of day

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Chatting shifts in at the wall table

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Telling jokes playing with the soul

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Lookin' out the window

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Girl brings two plates of full English over with plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomatoes

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Get my phone out

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's a give this girl a shout

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
See if she had a nice time, that's night up town

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ask if she finds his trying to again sometime

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And the count drops the phone right away

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My baby no man's around because you love the soul

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And if I know but show

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm not way really jobin' it

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And it counts like, oh, you need to hold it down

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Put your phone back, quit staring at space and it snag

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's that

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
She'll want you much more for not hanging on

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Stop me if I'm wrong, stop me if I'm wrong

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why should she be the one who decides where

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Fritz off for I know I know I'm wrong

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now the girls rude

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And she's rude, but she screwed right through you

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're beyond your knees, too

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We get together before we get together

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We labor except we're so supreme

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Without a way that's killing the ground

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You've put the sinky s' in, you never know

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Little workmaq, little workmaq to rock men's

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mix the pot mix the pot mix the pot mix the pot mix

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Lock the dispensation

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We're now with that heavy heel

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can take it believe it, believe it

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm like funny sweet, it's not like that

79

Yeah, till like a friend, till like a sad jump in which you clouts and that

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you really think I act like I'm telling you I'm serving the ACS and it's a game set of match

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Perfectly in control of this skull

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want the lead roll, I've been folded, I'm holding you to hold

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Bill sold, high speed gold

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Game over, game over two Cole

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, I can hear you

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I say, well, what's cooler than me in tow

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,040
sent in that I want to go through them all and I realized that once you listen to it

104
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,480
and I kind of sketch a lot and put it in there, put it in my line up, that the ID3 tags

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,960
just don't do it for me. So you know, I've got everywhere, it's like feedback feedback

106
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,560
for daily source code. You know, put some more information in your ID3 tags, please. You really

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
help this podcast throughout. What you hear in the background is the T-Cettle heating up.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I've switched to, you know, really more T in the mornings since I seem to be doing the

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,480
show earlier and earlier because I really want, you know, try to get into the office

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,000
around 11 o'clock in the morning. And it kind of works out. Get up at seven. You know, when

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I do it at seven o'clock, the alarm goes. Actually, the alarm doesn't go. The blackberry

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
starts doing its thing, which is built in alarm. And then, you know, I kind of roll over,

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
hit the snooze once, hit the snooze twice, maybe. So like I did this morning. And then,

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,840
we start going through the email. That's until 8 o'clock, then get up kind of stumble out

115
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,440
of bed, you know, roam around, get my first cup of tea, and then start lining up the show.

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,160
So that can start rolling at nine. And then, you know, once I'm done it, around 10 and 10

117
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,800
to 11 is uploaded. But have I told you how much I love doing this stuff? God. This is such

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,960
a great gig. This is what I've been dreaming of. It really is for years and years. Somewhere

119
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,800
there's a picture of me. I bet you I have this at home. I bet you my mom put that into a

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,680
scrapbook somewhere. There's a picture of me. And I was like four or five years old sitting

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,560
in my parents' closet with a broken reel to reel tape deck. You know, one that's really old

122
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,440
fashion ones with a wood casing around it in the plastic quarter inch reels on it. It's not

123
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,000
a quarter inch. Yeah, a quarter inch. Yeah. I guess it was a quarter. They was a two track.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,400
I don't know. Definitely a quarter inch. With a microphone, you know, looking like all

125
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,520
sheepers with my extremely white blonde hair, little, you know, porcupineish hair.

126
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,760
I got to find that and put that up on the, on show notes somewhere if I can. Well, I look for

127
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,320
it when I get back. So almost two weeks. Man, I better start putting some salt

128
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,080
Peter in my food, you know. Ni Hao from Asia, Adam. Hi. This is Ram Miranda. This is talking

129
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,120
from Singapore. You've heard some of the other feedback from Europe. So you've been going

130
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,080
from Africa, plenty from the US. I think there's even one from Australia. But I don't remember

131
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:56,200
hearing any podcasts, promos from Asia. So many, many podcasts, promos from Asia ran. But that's

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,280
okay. We welcome you. So I thought I would send a little bit of feedback. Maybe a quick little plug

133
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,840
from my own show. Sure. As far as first I want to say congratulations on your new Mac equipment.

134
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,760
As a die hard Apple of Dusius, I am jealous to the Mac. All I can say.

135
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,560
Do you hear that? It's like stuttering. It's not him. It's it's either his recording or my playback.

136
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,640
I hope it's not my playback. I can say as get a plenty of ram for your equipment and don't

137
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,160
forget to back up, back up, back up, back up. As far as feedback, there's two little requests.

138
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,040
Maybe for you to consider for your show. One, I love the wiki notes for the new show. They're

139
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,520
really great and the links are good. But in some ways, they're almost too good. It feels like I'm

140
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,680
reading a transcript to the show and there's been a couple times where I take a look at the

141
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,560
transcript notes, but for listening to the show and some things have been kind of ruined and

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,320
aside from just the hit test. Well, you know what that is. And that's kind of interesting when it

143
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,680
comes to the show notes. In my mind, show notes is something you look at later when you're in

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,040
show note browsing mode. But I guess some people do go to the show notes to see if the show is

145
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,600
going to be interesting. I don't know. Or if the topics are going to be what they want to hear.

146
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:17,480
That's kind of too bad. Maybe, maybe consider delaying the show notes more. I don't know.

147
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,720
It's what are other podcasts there's experiences with that. Do people go to your show notes to

148
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,600
find out what's on the episode or do they go later to get more information? And I think the show

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,080
notes should be pretty detailed. But that is one of the reasons why I'm kind of happy the show notes

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,840
aren't really right there in the description of the podcast because that does, I think that does

151
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,960
make people probably wrongly not tune in. Because I say, wow, you know, G, I may not be

152
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,400
interested in biodiesel. Whereas it could be a totally hilarious bit about a biodiesel. And also a lot

153
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,680
of times I do a lot of traveling and I'll record two or three of the daily source hodes and onto

154
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,800
the iPod and just listen to them on the airplane. So it would be nice to see maybe we get a

155
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,160
in conjunction with the wiki notes, a strip down RSS, a beat of the show notes, maybe just a quick,

156
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,720
you know, the one lineer is on what it is just to have something for the iPod and for those of us

157
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,080
who don't want the surprise of the show ruined, that would be great. The other thing would be,

158
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,120
as I'm kind of learning on my own podcasting, I'm a professional journalist. I was

159
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,040
been under the print side and this is really my first foray into the broadcasting or podcasting

160
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,320
element and I'm really enjoying it. But I thought, and I think your show is really great about

161
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:36,680
bringing a voice to some of the other podcasters and the whole revolution that's taking place.

162
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,160
But it'd be nice maybe to hear from somebody established like yourself and a professional

163
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:49,480
about ways that the rest of us may without the resources or the talent or especially the experience

164
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,040
ways we can bring our own podcast up to that next niche and just make them that much more

165
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,240
listenable and enjoyable. Okay, that's real easy. Has nothing to do with money, has nothing to do

166
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,840
with talent. It only has to do with one thing, passion, because that's what seems to be working and

167
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,440
I get asked this question all the time. What should I be doing? How can I make it better? It's simple.

168
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,840
It's not about your voice, it's not about how you mix stuff, it's not about the quality of your

169
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,920
audio, that may be things that you're interested in, that may be a part of what you're trying to

170
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,680
convey or what you want to have as your overall product and that's something that if you're interested

171
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,040
in it, you'll find your way through that. But passion, that's all that it's about,

172
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,840
pick something you're passionate about and if people can hear your passion in your voice while

173
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
you're talking about whatever it is you're talking about or while you're creating, it doesn't

174
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,680
have to be talking. Whatever you're creating on your podcast and it could be just for one person,

175
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,160
passion is going to do it time and time again. That always shines through. If you're going to give us

176
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,280
a little classes on podcasting 101 from your own views.

177
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:58,920
That's one other thing that I saw on, I think it was the Fagrogator, which is the video podcast channel

178
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,800
from qpodder.org. Imagine why I'm staying managing that. I'm subscribed to it. It's really

179
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,800
interesting. Some great videos coming through. I saw someone do a short video podcast about their

180
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,080
setup. That's what I'm going to do. I'll do that. Maybe I'll do that right after I'm done with

181
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,720
the show today. Just so you can see this setup and see what's working. And by the way,

182
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,560
when we started off with podcasting, I particularly was very specific about not using any outboard

183
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,000
gear. I wanted to make sure that it could be done on just any computer that had a microphone,

184
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,880
or that had a microphone jack for you to plug one into. And that's actually where Cas Blaster

185
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,240
came from. If you haven't seen it, please check out Cas Blaster.com. It is the perfect way to get

186
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:47,000
started in podcasting. It'll take care of all of the bits that are perhaps somewhat confusing,

187
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
levels, and how do you mix stuff in that? It takes care of beautifully and it creates your MP3

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,960
file. And pretty soon, it'll be, I think it'll be two buttons cast and blasts. That would be

189
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,600
really tremendous and maybe it's really helpful to some of those those of us fell along the way.

190
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,320
Anyway, a quick plug for my own show. It's called Miranda Wrights. It's an offshoot of my written

191
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:20,040
log. It can be found at the ITMS under Miranda Wrights or at Randcast, R-A-N-D-C-A-S-T.com.

192
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,480
As I said, our American journalist, I've been working and living here in Singapore for about

193
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,680
five and a half years. And my podcast is kind of centered around that what it's like living in Asia,

194
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,040
not being Asian. Myself, I do a lot of sound-seeing tours with my wife. A couple of places we've

195
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,680
been here to Singapore, Bali, Tunisia, about a week before the last terrorist attack. And recently

196
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,800
had a trio of sound-seeing tours from Europe. I do a little bit more on travel tips and because

197
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,440
I've done some riding. In fact, I have a couple of both hopefully coming out about Apple,

198
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,240
the iPod and OS Tiger. I try to do a little bit of max-inturek tips now and then just for my

199
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,920
own hobby. So, if people would like to listen to Tunian, that would be great to continue feedback

200
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,080
and laser. I can improve my show and just wanted to say, okay, for somebody here in Asia,

201
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,720
it doesn't listen to the radio at all. I would say, I get all of my 100% podcasting,

202
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,680
broadcasting, information, solely from the podcast. So, I just want to say once again,

203
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,680
thanks for being in inspiration and we'll keep listening, thanks for that. I'm gonna take care.

204
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,160
All right, thanks for the feedback. And Rand. Rand, Miranda. I get all my stuff.

205
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,640
Excuse me, I get everything from podcasts as well. That's basically where, that's my whole

206
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,480
information flow these days. And I do miss some stuff. You got to get some mainstream in there.

207
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Otherwise, you wake up one day and you're like, huh? That happened? I mean, I,

208
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,880
yesterday I watched, last night when I came back from dinner, I watched the John Stewart show.

209
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:03,640
I had never even seen the mugshot of Tom Delay. And I thought it was a joke.

210
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,720
I thought it really was a joke until I kind of dawned on me that that really was his mugshot.

211
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,520
Last night was fun. Went out to dinner with Ron, his wife, Marta, and Ron's mom, Wilma,

212
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,400
who was in town. That's right, Hurricane Wilma, come blowin' through town, everybody.

213
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I was hilarious. We had a great time. I had some great food. And I got back and it was just, you know,

214
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:35,160
totally wrecked from good food, fantastic wine. Just rosy cheek, you know, just sprawled out on the

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:43,720
couch, was just able to catch John Stewart and then rolled into bed. Again, this morning, as I said,

216
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,600
the blackberry went off and I was like, well, I could do it with at least three or four more hours.

217
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,920
And now I'm feeling the workout from Sunday. So that means that I guess either tonight or tomorrow,

218
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,880
I got to go back to the gym and got to keep out, got to keep out, got to get that cholesterol down.

219
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,720
See, should we do some Gmail feedback? Do some regular comments? Let me see. I just want to run down

220
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:15,800
this list because I have such a backlog. Let's see, this is about bio diesel, okay, Graham says fuel cells

221
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,280
were invented in 1800. Okay, haven't seen any fuel cell cars really on the market yet. Let's see this.

222
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,360
Oh, a lot of people sent in, you know, I asked you to do this test to kind of draw schematic of the

223
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:34,360
condo before I released the video podcast. And I think just about everyone who sent who did that said,

224
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,960
you know, this is exactly the way I imagined it, the theater of the mind worked really well. I described it perfectly.

225
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,480
And also I have to say that, you know, the way I created that video was of course to my mind's

226
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,320
eye, you know, the lighting, the music, the vibe. So I guess we're completely in sync on that.

227
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,880
Let's see what we have here. Hey, Adam, Apple should sponsor the show.

228
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,800
Yeah, you get a new iPod video, start doing video podcast and everyone into DSC once an iPod video.

229
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,440
You're a driving force in the economics of consumer electronics says Nick Casavall.

230
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,840
Yeah, that's right. It's funny because I think that if Apple actually started to pay me for that,

231
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,160
everyone would hate it. That's what, you know, when we do this and say it was stuff,

232
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,040
everyone's laughing and it's fun. And then the minute you do the same thing for a product that actually

233
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,200
Podger got paid to do, then it sucks. We've got a lot of experimentation to do still with the

234
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,200
with advertising. And I have some ideas. I definitely have some ideas. Okay, so this is cool.

235
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,960
This is from Phil Walker says, I've only started listening to podcasts and I say I'm really enjoying the

236
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,600
source code having this episode blah, blah, using my pocket piece PC and 7 iPod. However,

237
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,160
I thought you might like to know that iTunes kicked off in Australia yesterday. Let me see if that was

238
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:54,200
yesterday in Australia. That would mean today in Bangladesh. There's been heaps of good publicity on

239
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,760
the opening. Much media discussion of this kind of media versus CD and traditional delivery methods.

240
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,320
Might, although I'm not a nerd, I am convinced that web-based media is the go. It's really

241
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,600
catching on here and makes us Aussies feel like we're part of the rest of the world. And hey,

242
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,840
don't worry too much about the time gap between California and New York. Think of us. That's the only

243
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,440
reason why I can't get Patricia to move to Australia. I've been there. I love, I mean, I got to

244
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:24,120
I love Australia. Work hard, play hard. You've got the kind of the the properness of the United

245
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,440
Kingdom. You've got all the luxury that the United States might have to offer. And something we

246
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,760
call chiselahide from the Netherlands, which there is no real perfect translation, but chiselahide

247
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,640
is kind of like coziness. So I liked it. I had a great time. Oh, man, I should find that documentary

248
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,640
I did. We had, we did some wacky stuff while we were there. But, well, welcome. Although, of course,

249
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,440
the Australians were already a part of podcasting for quite a while. Now, I guess it's going to

250
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,920
burst wide open. So if you're new to podcasting and you're just listening to this

251
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:06,600
through iTunes, this is going to blow your mind. It really will. And yesterday, I said that I was

252
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:14,120
confused about all the stuff going on in politics right now. And I wanted some feedback on the indictments.

253
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,640
And, of course, the the Myers nomination. And, of course, people complied.

254
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,680
Greetings, Adam. All mighty pod father. This is Tim and Kelly from Supreme Court Watch podcast.

255
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,480
We, uh, listened with great interest to the latest daily source code when you dropped the

256
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,680
name of Harriet Myers, the Supreme Court nominee. You know, it's not a problem for it to be a

257
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,680
little bit confusing for you because it's confusing for us as well. Kelly, what do we know about

258
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,320
Harriet Myers? Well, I think the better question is, Tim, what don't we know about Harriet Myers?

259
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,200
And that's one of the fundamental problems with this nomination. She has been a nominee to the Supreme

260
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,240
Court for weeks now. And we really don't know anything more about her than we did the day she was

261
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,400
nominated. One of the very few things that we do know about her is that she is and has been for years

262
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,680
Bush's personal lawyer. And from the outside looking in, it seems as though that's the primary

263
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,240
reason she was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice. And hey, we're not the only ones that

264
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,160
have an issue with all of this. In fact, some of the president's most stalwart supporters that are

265
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,280
normally behind everything that he ever does, they're defecting in droves because they just don't trust

266
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,960
that Harriet Myers will vote the way that they want to on the Supreme Court. Hey, this is a really

267
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,240
complicated story with unprecedented politics and it just changes every day. For more information,

268
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,520
check us out at Supreme Courtwatch.org or search for Supreme Court Watch and iTunes. We're news,

269
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,120
views, and insight on the future of the Supreme Court. Thanks Adam. You. Thank you. Subscribe,

270
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,680
by the way. I appreciate that. That's very cool. Seems like, I don't know, it seems like we're

271
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:54,520
kind of just looking into mainstream media now. Like we're in this weird flocks, you know,

272
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,880
you've got the current administration and all kinds of trouble and certainly in trouble in the

273
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,960
quote, polls and trouble internally and with these indictments. What indictment, by the way,

274
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,920
Ron and I actually look some of that stuff up yesterday. What is a grand jury? What is an indictment?

275
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,240
And it's a little different thing you would think, actually. I don't even want to get into it now,

276
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,320
but the way it's presented is different than what it really is. None of it's good, clearly.

277
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,480
But what I'm going to little concerned about is everyone's really good at kicking down and

278
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,760
particularly when the guys are down there kicking them real hard. But, you know, but then what,

279
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,040
you know, we still have three years with this president. So, I think we need to get something in order

280
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,840
somewhere and something's got to happen and just gloating over it isn't really going to do much good.

281
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,240
And, you know, I'd like to move on, man. We've got a country to keep, this is still the best

282
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,120
country in the world. It's the best country to live in. It's the best country to do business.

283
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,520
It's a great country to fall in love in. It's a great country to drive in. It's just, to me,

284
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,720
it's, and I've lived in a lot of different countries. And so it's kind of a shame to see that we're all like,

285
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,120
ha ha ha, guys down, you know, and now what? And now no one's standing up to do anything. And that

286
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,600
who was on John Stewart last night? Al Franken, who I think is an extremely smart guy.

287
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,960
And, you know, it's just joke after joke after joke and, and I guess he's running for,

288
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,480
or talk about him running for Senator, which could be interesting, but, you know,

289
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't know. I'm just not impressed with anyone yet on any, on any points anywhere. You know,

290
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,080
where's the guy? Where's the leader? Where's I have the leader right here? This is the leader,

291
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:49,080
the next leader of the free world. Hello, Adam's Curry. This is Cheryl Murkowski, 25 year old,

292
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:58,280
beautiful woman, Smoker, and owner of three fourths of a long. I've appeared nude a number of times,

293
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:07,720
including while recording a program with my gal pal, why the wisdom over at luckybitradio.com.

294
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:15,800
Now, I want to know why the fuck you cut off mad yesterday. She's just trying to help people out.

295
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,720
Not everybody's a fucking billionaire with Chinese. Let's see everywhere.

296
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Flying, we're a giant a mobile sitting there with a huge horse cock like you. Okay, sure, mad,

297
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:40,200
may have huge vaginal lids and a pubic mound like nobody's business, but it's all

298
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:50,600
gone and grew pot-safe mash-up or all explosion. Okay, I mean, I have my own pot-show podcast,

299
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:59,480
but at least I don't cut off the form of Luna. Okay, Jesus. Anyways, I love you Adam's Curry,

300
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,960
and just remember, respect the bloated lesbian and don't cut her off. Have a fabulous day.

301
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,880
Man, look, hey, look, it's not like I didn't warn you at the beginning of the show that this was

302
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:21,080
not for a young years. Oh, man. I would vote for Cheryl. I'm afraid of Cheryl. That would be my choice.

303
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,040
I got an email from Rusty Bender. What a great name that is. Is that a stage name, Rusty?

304
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,680
If not, it should be. And let's see, that we had a whole email thread. He said,

305
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,200
start over the friend of mine used to belong to a joke death metal band. They did a couple of

306
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,480
songs that mentioned your name. As I said, it's meant to be a joke or you're interested in hearing them.

307
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,840
And Rusty, of course, is from the strange brain radio podcast. And, uh, and I've well,

308
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,760
what am I going to say? No, of course, I wanted to hear that. Now, this goes back to the MTV

309
00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:01,240
days. Ah, yes. Just to let you know how loved I felt, often, in those late 80s, early 90s.

310
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:28,360
There's all coming. Your jacket is clear. You are such a risk to get off the air.

311
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring.

312
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:59,320
Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring. Dye in a ring.

313
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,560
Death corpse from their blood, whips, and vomit CD. I just made me feel warm all over.

314
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,760
You'll ask a pod show. Yeah, it's real. We're no Adam Curry and we're no Don and Drew Show.

315
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,840
And we certainly didn't win any pod casting awards because we're too new for that. We're just podcasters,

316
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,760
pod casting from Anchorage, Alaska. That's right. I said Anchorage, Alaska. We're the biggest state,

317
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,280
you know, we're bigger than Texas who claim if Alaska melted, we would be the biggest state.

318
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:38,600
What a bunch of crap that is. Anyway, if you got a pod show, you got a gig, you got a promo.

319
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:48,040
Kick it to us and we'll plug in. Hey, and if you're a subscriber, you can go over to our website at www.alaskapodshow.com

320
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:55,320
and read the show notes because you would really have nothing else to do. Hi, this is Matthew Evel.

321
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,200
You know, pod casting is renewed my faith in the music industry. I'm not kidding. The just one

322
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,360
who thought that all the radio stations were only playing with their corporate vote rewards

323
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,200
were telling them, a long comes this new medium that's run by people who actually love the music. They

324
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,520
listen to the music. Independent artists like myself can share our music with people around the world.

325
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Oh, it's making a wish. Check out my new album, Bearing Coffee at www.mathewebel.com.

326
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,160
So I went looking Matthew. I don't think that the new album is on the pod safe music network yet,

327
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,880
but of course, very familiar with Matthew Ebel's work. So when back into the playlist and

328
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,200
yep, lo and behold, there's one that I played before and I'd promise myself I was going to play a

329
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,520
couple of pod safe tunes I'd played before to kind of keep the rotation going, you know, just one

330
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,520
of day is not going to do it. Something that PW turned me on to. Sally went down Matthew Ebel on the

331
00:28:46,520 --> 00:29:15,160
daily source code, Sally went down. Sally went down. Sally went down.

332
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:40,200
Sally was ravaged, sweet saw the woman. Every song that she fills her room.

333
00:29:40,200 --> 00:30:00,720
What you got, come with me, I'm not too happy now, what's a good like her gonna do?

334
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,520
Saturday never made it to the road, never saw the lack never even heard the drink coming.

335
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Saturday I went walked on the track, meant where the rails took and never thought to love back.

336
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:21,520
It's Saturday not that she was doing right, but she went home early, but she never saw the lack never heard the drink coming.

337
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,520
It hit her in the back, Saturday went down, Saturday went down.

338
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Saturday didn't want to get involved with the scene before her.

339
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Keep it down walking on the track, maybe they were just ignore her.

340
00:30:52,520 --> 00:31:01,520
But she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down, she kept her head down.

341
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,520
She didn't listen to the man before her.

342
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Saturday!

343
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Saturday!

344
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:32,520
Saturday never made it to the road, never saw the lack never even heard the drink coming.

345
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Saturday never walked on the track, meant where the rails took and never thought to love back.

346
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,520
It's Saturday not that she was doing right, but she went home early, but she kept her head down.

347
00:31:45,520 --> 00:32:00,520
It hit her in the back, Saturday went down, Saturday went down.

348
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,520
Matthew Ebel, went down.

349
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Filling the pages, that's CD He Did in 2001, it says here, interesting.

350
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
So I can't wait to hear the new one, Matthew, very cool.

351
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Check out the website.

352
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Patricia's gotten into some trouble while I've been over here.

353
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,520
She's locked herself out of the house twice.

354
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,520
Actually, once she left and she put her keys in the bag that she didn't take with her.

355
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,520
And of course, Christina didn't have keys.

356
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
What happened yesterday?

357
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,520
She went out for a walk on the downs, which is right behind her house.

358
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
It's beautiful, just a hundred miles of nature.

359
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,520
You walk right out the back gate and you're kind of through it.

360
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Like a tunnel of trees, it's so idyllic.

361
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,520
And then you're on the downs, she went for a walk and she left.

362
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,520
And she closed the door, the back door, but we rarely lock that up.

363
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,520
We're just going out for a couple minutes.

364
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Please don't break in now.

365
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,520
And so we have two dogs still.

366
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,520
And Jesse, who's a, you don't really want to mess around with Jesse.

367
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,520
She's a golden retriever, a shepherd mixed your mud.

368
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,520
She somehow managed to lock the door with her paw.

369
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
But it's just like it's a dead bulb.

370
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
As you push it down at the bottom of the door, click it locks.

371
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,520
And she actually wound up having to have some come over and break a window to get in.

372
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:30,520
But here's the part, the two days before that, because this has happened with one day in between that she's locked herself out.

373
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,520
She went around to the neighbors and known was home.

374
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,520
And then on the left-hand neighbors who, oh, we know, but we haven't really hung out with her or anything.

375
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:48,520
She got their son to climb up with a ladder and go through a window that was open in Christina's room.

376
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,520
And then climb through and then go down to the front door and open it up.

377
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,520
And she said, boy, he was really cute.

378
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah, how old was he? Oh, you know, 1920.

379
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
That's the same age when she found me.

380
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Should I be concerned, listeners? Should I be worried?

381
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Be it away from home this long?

382
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I don't think so.

383
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,520
But you know, we've talked about Patricia and I missing talking to each other.

384
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Just about now, missing some other stuff.

385
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Hey Adam, this is Michael Carino from the digital media cast experiment.

386
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,520
After doing the experiment for a number of months, my wife started considering herself a podcast widow.

387
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
And of course, that kind of neglect isn't good.

388
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,520
So when the new season of Survivor and the apprentice started,

389
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,520
I asked her if she wanted to do a podcast about these two shows after each episode.

390
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,520
She said, yes, which means now we get to spend more time together.

391
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Furthermore, she's now listening to podcasts.

392
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,520
You know, she's got to figure out what the other podcasters are doing now.

393
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,520
And she's starting to get into the podcast culture and community.

394
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
This is all goodness.

395
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Now we sides on widowing my wife for these two shows.

396
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Armed share apprentice and armed share survivor are both growing in popularity

397
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,520
in over 22 countries worldwide.

398
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
You can check them out at tubecasts.com.

399
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
That's TUECAS.com.

400
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
But this is just the beginning.

401
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,520
We hope to be adding more television-based podcasts to the tubecasts.com fleet.

402
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Even now, I'm talking to podcasters and even conventional media personalities

403
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
about doing tubecasts on other TV shows.

404
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,520
For the conventional media folks, it's an easy way for them to cross over

405
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
from their hell to our Navana.

406
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
And for the podcasters, it's a way to broaden their audiences.

407
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,520
So check out tubecasts.com.

408
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Maybe you'll want to do one.

409
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Any questions?

410
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Just go to tubecasts.com.

411
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Looking through the Gmail here.

412
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,520
This is pretty interesting.

413
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Apparently, let's see.

414
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Apparently, Senseo, or Senseo, but believe me, it's Senseo.

415
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,520
It's trying to build up their brand name in the US.

416
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,520
And what they're doing is, sorry, the blackberries interfering there.

417
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,520
What they're doing is, if you send them a picture of your coffee maker,

418
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
they'll send you a Senseo for free.

419
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,520
I think you only have to pay the cost of shipping.

420
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,520
So that's kind of weird.

421
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,520
You know, these guys are trying to do some kind of gorilla marketing,

422
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
yet they're passing right by podcasting,

423
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,520
and we've been working so hard on using them as an example.

424
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
It's a fuck you.

425
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Can't say anything but that.

426
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm no more Senseo from now on.

427
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm going to figure out a way to break you to break your,

428
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,520
your jet, the Jedi mind trick I played on you with the burping.

429
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,520
I'm going to figure out a way to reanker that to something else.

430
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Just pisses me off.

431
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
These guys, they're not doing the right thing.

432
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
We've really done a lot.

433
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,520
With a lot of fun, by the way, that to figure out new ways of advertising

434
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
and doing it for absolutely nothing.

435
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,520
And now they're doing all kinds of cool gorilla marketing stuff.

436
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
I can just see them, you know.

437
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Yeah, well, we've got all the podcasters talking about us.

438
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Screw you.

439
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
I'm sick and tired of that.

440
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Hey, Adam, it's Michael Spectre from Melbourne Down Under.

441
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
I just thought I'd give you a bit of feedback on

442
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,520
data source code 264 where you would talk about podcasts and lectures.

443
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
And whatnot, it would encourage students to skip lectures.

444
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Many universities already provide their lectures in MP3 format.

445
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,520
And some of the more forward thinking,

446
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,520
you need to learn learning students to already download these lectures.

447
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,520
So while it's not at this stage, traditional podcast,

448
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,520
students can actually get access to the MP3 formats.

449
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,520
This is great for external students, but also the last,

450
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
as you said, for students who miss lectures.

451
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Some of the more forward thinking infrastructure providers

452
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,520
to universities are actually starting to bring our assess

453
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
into their services, such as the iLecture system,

454
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
which is also like to appear in the US.

455
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,520
So it allows them to actually drop an audio file

456
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,520
into the system, produces an RSS feed that allows people to

457
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
subscribe.

458
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,520
And you're right, it's so many changes that will take place

459
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,520
within the education context, not just for students, but with

460
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,520
the incorporates and how we can deliver enhanced

461
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
podcast or OPML files that bring together

462
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,520
not just a single stream of content, but alternate

463
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,520
streams of multiple content to a student all in one go.

464
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,520
So a lot of exciting times ahead and thanks for the show.

465
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
I was an every day.

466
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Michael, thank you, thank you, thank you.

467
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
I was thinking about that.

468
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
I think you have to do it the other way around.

469
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Of course, it's great to be able to have an RSS feed

470
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,520
from either a certain course, a certain class,

471
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
a certain professor, a certain lecturer.

472
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
I think it should be turned around.

473
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,520
And I didn't know the universities had these big systems

474
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
that can do all that stuff.

475
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,520
That's very exciting because what I'd say is turn it around

476
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
and give just like, if you haven't seen gigadile,

477
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
check out gigadile.net.

478
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,520
It's a very interesting thing that Andrew Grummit

479
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
from the iPod 11 team put together.

480
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,520
The way it works is you can create a channel,

481
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
and he's built it in a very open fashion,

482
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
which means that anyone can,

483
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
I guess you can set it up however you want,

484
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,520
but the concept is anyone can add not as whole show

485
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
but an episode to the feed.

486
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
So I could be an intermediary for you.

487
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
In fact, I'm thinking about setting up a video

488
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
channel on gigadile for exactly this very reason.

489
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,520
So why wouldn't you make it so that every student has

490
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,520
their own RSS feed that this university system can put stuff through?

491
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,520
So you get all the stuff automatically that is meant for you.

492
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Think about it.

493
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Think about a professor having the opportunity to say,

494
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
okay, here are my students for this particular course.

495
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
I'm going to give them this particular podcast.

496
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
And that could be an MP3 file,

497
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
but it could also be a PDF for a word document.

498
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
I mean, Jesus Christ,

499
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
think about the power of that.

500
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Fantastic.

501
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,520
And I want you to think about something else.

502
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,520
It's kind of nasty.

503
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
But have you the last time?

504
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I'll do it in a second.

505
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
I'll do it in a second.

506
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Let me do something else first.

507
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,520
This came through in the cockpit cast.

508
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Of course, we know there are plenty of me.

509
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
I'm way into aviation.

510
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,520
There's lots of great aviation podcasts.

511
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,520
You can find that at IndiePotter.org under the aviation note, I believe.

512
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,520
And so the cockpit cast, which is done by a pilot for a major airline,

513
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
and he's got a big plane.

514
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
And that's he's got certainly got some millions worth of airplane

515
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
strapped to his ass.

516
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,520
What he's done now is he created a little video of an approach

517
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
to the San Jose Mercury Airport.

518
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
And he literally put his video camera right up in the front,

519
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
like on the dashboard, if you will.

520
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
And well, it's not going to mean it.

521
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
You're not going to see it, but listen to this.

522
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,520
So we're 100 feet off the ground, just about to land.

523
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Copilot's calling it out.

524
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,520
50, 40, 30, 20.

525
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
Oh, I'm seeing the runway.

526
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
10.

527
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Right.

528
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Still five feet.

529
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Five feet off the ground.

530
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Boom.

531
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
No, it's wheeled down.

532
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
Ah.

533
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
You won't believe what you see.

534
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,520
This is the view that people pay money for.

535
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,520
And what a racket that thing makes.

536
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Just fantastic.

537
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
I love it.

538
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
Also isn't approached to San Jose,

539
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,520
and I think also an SFO approach.

540
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
And there you go.

541
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
They're off taxing off the runway.

542
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
Oh, man, that is just so cool.

543
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
So cool to see that.

544
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
So I think it's stuff like that.

545
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
That's really going to be great for video podcast.

546
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Show little bits of stuff that you normally wouldn't see anywhere else.

547
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
And only people who are in that certain vocation.

548
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Okay.

549
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Now I want you to do it.

550
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Do you remember the last time you were really sick?

551
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
I mean, sick to your stomach sick?

552
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,520
Like, just, you know, really, really.

553
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
I mean, you know, when it just, you can't help it.

554
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,520
And you're just spewing and you're puking all over the place.

555
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
And you feel horrible.

556
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
And just as you think you're done, you,

557
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
oh, man, here comes more.

558
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Senseo.

559
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,520
You're coming to my podcast.

560
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
I didn't put cast.

561
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,520
You were more well computing on PDFs.

562
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
You've been listening to you.

563
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,520
You are more hardware, more software.

564
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Go wish them.

565
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Give them tips on tricks.

566
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,520
And he isn't.

567
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,520
Tomas Riffon-Goydine, or Cleamon-Shopin.

568
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,520
It's a lot of art.

569
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
It's a lot of art.

570
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:24,520
It's a lot of art.

571
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,520
It's a lot of art.

572
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
It's huge, huge, huge.

573
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,520
It's the roadhouse podcast and it's a new hour.

574
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Every Saturday.

575
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
I've been stepping out.

576
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
Try to find.

577
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,520
Subscribe now.

578
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
And I tune to roadhousepodcast.com.

579
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
The roadhouse.

580
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,520
The finest blues you've never heard.

581
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I've never heard.

582
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Perhaps, I've been deleted.

583
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
When I'm stepping out.

584
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
Shoulda been standing.

585
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
Hot chill.

586
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Should only be enjoyed under the supervision of a podcasting professional.

587
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Warning.

588
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Do not attempt this at home.

589
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Hello Adam.

590
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
This is Jagatemek from Lublin Poland.

591
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I'd like to thank you for inspiring me to start my own podcast podcasting.pl.

592
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,520
I started podcasting February and I liked the idea so much that I began promoting it in Poland.

593
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,520
And I'm happy to say that the podcasting vibe is picking up pays in our country.

594
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,520
And we now have people podcasting in Polish from Poland and abroad.

595
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
So thanks a lot for that Adam.

596
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
And give my best to Patricia and Christina.

597
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Before I go, I would like to say a few words to the listeners of the Daily Source Code,

598
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,520
who may not know that they are drop Polish podcasts out there.

599
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,520
Listen carefully, as there is a little surprise for you in there as well.

600
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,520
We have an碼 vision from the Jewishiri.

601
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,520
At the time, radio that began hisumental vision

602
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,500
accompanied by spy-ver tulee to the country,

603
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
inBMK and Control.

604
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,520
While still being emotional, each person wants to try to tutenspublicly.

605
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,480
Not meant to talk to innocent young people,

606
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,020
or to hear it any scare.

607
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,020
podcasting of posts.

608
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,160
I would like to ask you how you would like to ask your fans to listen to the post

609
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,020
podcasts, which you can find in the description of the podcast, thank you for your

610
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,020
questions.

611
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,700
You know, I have a thought there that maybe that was Dyerim Curry Dying Polish, I'm

612
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,900
sure the comic strip blogger, aka MS Mobile's Guy, will be happy to translate what we just

613
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,620
heard there in that short little promo.

614
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,820
Before that, we also heard a German promo.

615
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,780
I heard some of just kind of skip by, I don't care, I don't care, I just want everyone

616
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
to enjoy.

617
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,620
I want people from all lands to be able to tune into this stuff and enjoy it.

618
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,860
Okay, so for the C. tomorrow with Thursday and Friday, it'd be cool if you sent me

619
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,860
and some stuff for Friday.

620
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,020
Let's make Friday a big ass party show.

621
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,340
I want the best mashups, I want the best real rock and podsafe music.

622
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,220
I want some, you know, just some, thank God it's Friday, we're ripping towards the weekend

623
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,220
type of stuff.

624
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
We do that.

625
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,220
That would be cool.

626
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,060
Let's have a big celebration, because if we do my last day, unfortunately, it's going

627
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,300
to take that long because I was planning on kind of mowsing back on like today.

628
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,340
It'll be my last day in San Francisco for then go back and of course, I'm going to come

629
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,420
back briefly to the West Coast.

630
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,420
The idea is I do want to go to the podcast that I spoke, I'm not sure if I'm going

631
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,420
to be able to make it.

632
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,460
I don't think we're going to do any, well, I told you, I'm not going to do any damn announcements

633
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:55,300
because that doesn't seem like the right venue for what we want to announce.

634
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:01,980
So let's party it up, y'all, okay, nothing else going on today, just more, more rain here

635
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:07,140
in Northern California, please feel free to send any type of feedback to Atomiccurry.com

636
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,940
and I beg of you to please give me some context in the ID3 tag so I know what the hell

637
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,820
is going on and what to expect.

638
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,260
If we do that, it's just going to make it so much better because years from now, when

639
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,460
we have search engines that are doing all the right stuff and searching the ID3 tags of

640
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,860
MP3 files online and you know Google is going to figure that out.

641
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,580
Once we've got all that going, then we will be prepared for it.

642
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,500
So more work on the ID3 tags, please.

643
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,980
