00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Daily source code, May 12th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,600
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,560
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,520
since radio is invented.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,240
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,680
It was $60 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,360
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,400
Everybody straight from Curry Cottaging Guild for this is your Daily Source code.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,080
Oh, right-hand another bright sun shiny day in the UK.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,200
You know, I don't know where that bad rap comes from that it's always bad weather

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,920
and Britain is just not true.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
It may be a little bit cold, but the sun really makes up for it.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,880
And I am a little lagging today.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,200
I had some visitors last night.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,480
I'll tell you all about that.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
Power, power, power, power, and power.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,840
And coming up of course today, the promos got a lot of those.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,640
Got some pod safe music that I want to play for you as usual.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,040
Also, young Polettes hit test.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,320
Number 38 already.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,000
I've been sitting on that for a couple of days.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
I just haven't had time to work it into the show.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,280
And some email.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,240
Got emails to talk about that came in through at amercurry.com.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,840
Unfortunately, I noticed too late that I only have two sheets of paper left.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,760
Actually, three sheets of paper left in the printer.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,760
So, I kind of like switch between applications between recording and readings.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,880
So, bear with me today.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,360
Power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,960
So, a couple of days ago, I think it was Monday.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,360
I received an email from corona one.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,320
That is the handle of one of the chopper pilots that we flew with when I was in Iraq last

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
year.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,280
That was February, 2004.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,520
When the Dutch Marines were over there and we did a live radio broadcast for our entire

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
week.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,600
And I've kept in touch with most of the guys, you know, some of them are off to Afghanistan now,

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
actually.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,200
And it turns out that, oh, bon, go ahead, sir.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,320
It turns out that the Dutch pilots, and I'm talking about Shenukh, primarily Shenukh

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
helicopters.

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,520
If you don't know what a Shenukh is, that's Helicopter with two, two rotor heads.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,160
So, not two rotor blades, but two rotor heads.

45
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,720
So, you got the rotors on the front and rotors on the back.

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,440
It's, you know, the big one that can transport, like I don't know, was at 25 or 30

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
people and all kinds of different configurations.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,000
That's where we actually flew in Iraq.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,960
They also fly cougars and think they used to do links or something like that.

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,840
But these guys apparently are so good that they train pilots all over the world, particularly

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
in the simulators.

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,880
It also turns out, you know, this, that there's a Dutch company in, in, uh,

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,480
hoofed daughter, if I believe it is, who really farms out most of the flight simulators

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,200
all over Europe.

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,400
And, uh, I guess since there's a Dutch connection there, the, the Dutch pilots are the

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,520
ones that train everybody.

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,440
So, don't doubt that Han, that's his, has his name, that's Han, uh, that's hotel alpha

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,600
November, not Oscar November.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,840
Although he's quite a Han, uh, it turns out that he, um, uh, is about, uh, located

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,080
about 35, 40 minutes away from Guilford, uh, where the cottage is.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
And, uh, you know, he sent me an email, he said he'd seen some of the, the rag mags

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
in Holland.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,200
He said, you know, fuck them, don't, you know, don't get brought down by whatever

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
the media saying.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,840
Which was nice of him to say, but, you know, not that I really let that happen anyway.

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,680
And, uh, he said he was here for a couple of weeks.

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,240
And, uh, so I sent him a mail back and gave him my current phone number because he only

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
had my, uh, my Dutch cell phone.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
He called me.

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,200
He said, well, you know, you know, we're, we're here with a couple of guys.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,960
And, uh, we'd love this type of ice cooker for some coffee.

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I said, yeah, anytime you want.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Just how about tonight?

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,600
So, last night around 8 o'clock, uh, four, uh, four of these guys showed up on my door

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
steps.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Two bad Patricia wasn't here.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,320
She totally would have, almost, and just my microphone here.

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
She totally would have enjoyed it.

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,800
They showed up with flowers, a typical Dutch tradition, you know, whenever you go to visit

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,840
someone, even if it's just for coffee, you bring a little bouquet of flowers.

81
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,200
And so they, they brought, uh, their obligatory, obligatory bouquet, which was very nice.

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
And we had a great time.

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,800
And we, of course, we had a lot of aviation talk and, uh, talk a lot about Afghanistan.

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,560
Um, NATO is now, um, has about 9,000 troops in, uh, Afghanistan.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,840
I'm not quite sure what the mission is other than peacekeeping because it seems that, uh,

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,120
it's still kind of messy over there, uh, Karzai, you know, that's the, I think that Karzai

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,600
is the dude who, um, who has the cape and the funky hat, which, as a total shill, you

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,160
know, he, I think he used to be on the board of directors of some oil company or something.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,800
Um, so he's now the president officially elected and he said, oh, we need some help, you

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,960
know, and then, uh, there you go, uh, Yaptop Schreffer, um, that's the official pronunciation

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
as Dutch guy.

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,320
Uh, you might know him as Jep De Hoopsheffer, uh, he's the head of, uh, NATO right now.

93
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,360
He said, yeah, no problem with send everybody over.

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,040
So I think, uh, a couple of shinooks are over there and, uh, lots of the, uh, the crews

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,200
that were that, uh, I met in Iraq or now, also over there.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,840
And of course, they're saying, hey, come on over, you know, and I can do some podcasting

97
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
from there.

98
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
So, uh, I, uh, I'm, I've been, I've been contemplating it.

99
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I wouldn't mind going, actually.

100
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,400
I have no idea what, uh, what the situation is or what's going on, but it might be fun to do

101
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
that.

102
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,520
So we'll see if we can, uh, move the, uh, uh, uh, I guess it's the Air Force, enough of the

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Air Force of the Marine.

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,960
I guess it's just the Air Force right now that's there.

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,320
See if we can get him to, uh, to, uh, to give me a ride over and, uh, we could hang

106
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
up for a little bit.

107
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,600
That might be an interesting podcast.

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,360
If I can get some connectivity to upload, uh, speaking of, um, aviation, uh, I, uh, I've

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,600
seen this before, but I figured I just, I read a couple of them off, um, Peter George sent

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,880
me the aviation gripe sheet.

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,760
And I have to know that, uh, particularly in commercial aviation ventures, there's always

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,400
a little bit of, I'd say, healthy tension between, uh, engineers who maintain, um, uh, uh,

113
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,000
the machines and pilots.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,680
And this is, uh, some actual maintenance complaints submitted by, uh, quantas.

115
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,080
That's Australian, uh, the Australian Airlines.

116
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,480
The quantas crews, the pilots, and the solutions recorded by the maintenance engineers.

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,720
Uh, by the way, I want to point out quantas is the only major

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,560
airline that has never, ever had an accident, but you probably knew that if you ever saw, uh,

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
rain man.

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
So, uh, I just run out a couple of these stuff.

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
They're pretty funny.

122
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,200
So, pilot says, um, left inside main tire almost needs replacement.

123
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,600
And the ground crew says, almost replaced left inside main tire, pilot says, test flight

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,680
okay, except auto land very rough, engineers, auto land not installed on this aircraft.

125
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,360
Pilots says something loose in cockpit solution, something tightened in cockpit.

126
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,400
Pilots says dead bugs on windshield and the engineer say, life bugs on back order.

127
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Pilots say auto pilot in altitude, hold mode produces a 200 feet per minute descent.

128
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,880
So, and the engineer say, cannot reproduce problem on the ground.

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
And it just goes on and on and on and on and it's a fucking hilarious.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,040
And of course, all, uh, I'll post a copy of that on, uh, on the show notes for today's

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
a daily source code.

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,800
So, uh, after that visit last night, even though we didn't do any beer drinking,

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,240
which is very typical of, of, of people in aviation, I'm just tired.

134
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,960
And it's also of course, because Patricia's still on her, on her personal slash business trip.

135
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,120
And, um, so I'm, uh, I'm being Mr. Mom.

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,640
Oh, by the way, um, the dinner that I had at TGI Friday is where Christina had invited her

137
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,840
current boyfriend, um, Benji, he couldn't make it because he, uh, I guess he, uh,

138
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,400
goes to the gym on, uh, on Monday night, so it was a Monday, Tuesday night.

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,560
So I have nothing to report on fortunately, but she did bring her girlfriend, uh, Ellie.

140
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,200
And they're both in the same class, same grades, uh, many of the same classes that they take

141
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,480
together. Uh, so I did get a lot of information and intel.

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,640
Actually, much more than I really wanted to know.

143
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,600
Yeah, thanks for everything you're dealing with podcasting and hate all you daily source code listeners.

144
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,280
And Adam, are you, or any of the daily source code listeners like?

145
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,840
Because it plays the same songs over and over again.

146
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,560
Well, then why don't you check out the defy radio podcast at defyradio.blogspot.com.

147
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,200
We've got some great music. You would not hear otherwise, uh, bands like architect.

148
00:08:43,160 --> 00:09:07,560
If you're sick of all the same radio stuff over and over again, defyradio and turn on defyradio.

149
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,560
Defyradio.blogspot.com. Well, isn't that a coincidence? Just having to look in the

150
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,120
pod save music bins and submit your pod save music to podsafe at podshow.com.

151
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,720
It is a great tune. So check out the defy radio podcast and architect now on the source code with most of us.

152
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:49,720
We've got it all figured out. We've got nothing left to lose. We've got it all figured out.

153
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:59,960
We've got it all figured out. If we're gonna make a movement then I hope we make it soon.

154
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,920
And if we're gonna make a movement we need you, uh,

155
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,360
most of us screaming at the radio.

156
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,560
Now we'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet.

157
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:57,800
We've got it all so figured out. We've got one thing left to do. We've got it all so figured out.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:08,280
We'll make our movement and if we're gonna make our way out then I thought we'd make it soon.

159
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:22,520
If we're gonna make our way out we need you now, most of us screaming at the radio.

160
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:31,160
Now we'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet.

161
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:43,000
Now we'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet.

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:56,440
We'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet so we'll always be on our feet.

163
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:12,840
Oh, stars screaming at the radio. We'll change, most of us screaming at the radio.

164
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:23,240
We'll change, most of us.

165
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Sir, do you know what a podcast is? The podcast is something that you hold your little eye

166
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,360
pod and I believe it might be a cradle where you put it inside the cradle if I'm not mistaken that

167
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,640
things that I'd nature. So you have no idea what a podcast is. I don't have no idea what a podcast is.

168
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,520
I think it's a blog of some sort. Do you know what a podcast is? It's supposed to be a program

169
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,040
that can be captured to go into an iPod. I don't think that's really the way people think about it.

170
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,600
I know what it is I've heard of it but I don't really understand the concept.

171
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,800
Now, ma'am, do you know what a podcast is?

172
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,240
Well, no, yes, I don't know.

173
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,320
So it does have something to do with vegetables.

174
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,800
For the morning, for the night, no.

175
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,960
And it banana is when you say what you're saying when you're saying what you're saying.

176
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,640
So all in all, in your words, a podcast is...

177
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,000
I like it a lot. Excellent, thank you very much.

178
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,800
Thanks to Jeremy Coleman, the guys over serious. We're putting that together for me.

179
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,840
Yeah, we still got a long way to go on podcast. You know, yesterday, oh, we moved my mic here.

180
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,480
I was going, you know, we have everything now on the pod show servers, all the podcasts,

181
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,920
the pod squad and daily source code. And so I have a better access. We actually have finally

182
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,600
have real access to my stats. And I found out something very interesting. First of all, each

183
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,560
individual daily source code, and it does vary, is downloaded, because I can, of course,

184
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,000
you know, tell if someone has actually been listening to it. That would require DRM digital

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,200
rights management, which is such a horrible word for actually something pretty cool,

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,640
you know, because you're your player, you know, MP3 player, actually can tell if you press

187
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,360
stop or, you know, pause or what you skipped. And it can actually send that information somewhere.

188
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,560
And there would be some great reasons to be able to send that back. You know, how about podcast

189
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,600
Ali, a bit Chris McIntyre would love having some of that info to publish it. But of course,

190
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,800
so we immediately associate DRM with not being able to copy files, which of course is also a part of it.

191
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,120
But so I certainly talk of downloads. Each individual show of the daily source code receives

192
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,320
anywhere from 75,000 to 100,000 downloads, individual unique downloads, a couple of interesting things.

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Of that number, and this is what really blew me away, about 20 to 25,000 actually are downloaded

194
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,480
by iPodders. So that means that really only, well, let's say I'm just going to be conservative,

195
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,840
20% receive it through an iPodder, through a subscription, and the rest all

196
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,040
downloaded by clicking on the link on daily source code.com or on curry.com.

197
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,360
So that really tells me a hell of a lot. First of all, there's a big relationship between

198
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,560
podcasters and the audience. It's actually the audience with the content, which is extremely nice.

199
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,960
The second thing it tells me is, damn, we got a lot of work to do. At least if we're talking

200
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,560
about iPodders and really building up the Tvo experience and having things just show up,

201
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,600
could also mean, of course, that bandwidth has gotten so good that people don't mind waiting for

202
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,160
things. But I think we really have a lot of evangelizing to do. And also what's interesting

203
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,520
is that each individual show, it's not like everyone listens to it on Thursday or on Friday,

204
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,760
when it when it shows released. In fact, quite the opposite. It takes up to, well, sometimes up to

205
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,840
four weeks for really the downloads to slow down to a couple of days. It's even after two weeks

206
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,400
you're seeing thousands being downloaded every single day. So I guess the whole concept of time

207
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,200
shifting really goes much further than when I publish it. And when you theoretically have it

208
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,560
automatically downloaded, the actual consumption of it really differs. And I think about it,

209
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,360
it makes sense. Because people, maybe you catch up on a couple of shows over the weekend or you

210
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,080
save stuff, you know, you just, I don't come in a download five or ten podcasts because it

211
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,040
is a goma trip or I'm taking a plane ride or something like that. So I always thought there was

212
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,800
the other way around. I always thought that that in essence, we probably had 80% of people were

213
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,840
subscribed through iPodders and 20% were downloading it at random, but it turns out to be

214
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,040
exactly the opposite. And another statistic, which blew me away, which was in the Wall Street

215
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:22,840
journal yesterday. Here's a riddle for you. What percentage? Now, you know that the people are

216
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,000
using iTunes, music store and Rhapsody or whatever, all these different music services to buy

217
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,840
music legally online. Apple is doing what it's like 1.2 million songs a day that they're

218
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,240
that people are downloading and buying. So what percentage do you think that is of the entire music

219
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:50,440
business? I got to tell you that I really thought it was much, much larger. It's only 2%.

220
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Can you believe that? It's only 2% of the entire revenue of the music industry. So, you know,

221
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,720
that's a lot to think about. And then something showed up in email,

222
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,360
hold on after I said, I don't have my printer as on a paper or so. I finally received the open letter

223
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:17,320
to the podcasting community from the, um, what is it? The pod spec working group. And it sounds

224
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,440
like a pretty good idea. Let me see if they have a, let's say you were out. What is the URL of this?

225
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:30,360
Of course, I'll put that in the show notes as usual. Um, the URL is pod spec WG. And I'm sorry,

226
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,360
PSWG dot blogspot.com. And I like the idea what they're saying here because, um, so the basically

227
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,080
it's an open letter to podcast software developers, directory managers, content produces content creators

228
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,480
and listeners. Hey, I fit in every single one of those categories. Um, we form the podcast specification

229
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,080
working group because we believe further collaboration can eliminate barriers to the growth of the

230
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,520
listening audience. We propose further to further refining existing standards. I don't know what the

231
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,600
standards are, um, or what you want to refine and create new ones with, uh, with the necessary. I

232
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,840
guess that should be one necessary. Um, the groups current aims are to enable one click subscription.

233
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,360
Yeah, that would be nice. We haven't even figured that out in the weblog world yet. So I don't know

234
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,320
how that's going to go. Um, standardization of metadata, describing podcast, so directory services

235
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,960
and users can more easily find content. I'm all for that. Of course, that's, you know, part of that

236
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,760
is how we fill out our ID3 tag information. And I like this idea very much, but I was severely disappointed

237
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,040
when I went to the website. And it doesn't seem like it's a very independent group because there's

238
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:45,720
basically three iPodder applications are listed there on their links page, uh, to Jay Potter

239
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,240
and, um, two other ones I can't remember offhand. I like, you know, that kind of sucks. You know,

240
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,520
so, you know, that's not an open working group in my mind. Either you put everyone's iPodder on

241
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,360
there and solicit everyone to, you know, to list their application on your page or you do nothing.

242
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
So that was a bit of a disappointment. So I'm not going to join up yet until I, you know, find

243
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,360
out if there is some kind of ulterior motive behind behind that. Which I'm not against by the way,

244
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,760
but, you know, this comes across as like a real open thing. And, you know, if they're promoting

245
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,200
only specific applications that that doesn't seem entirely fair. I just wanted to mention about

246
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,800
architect, the song that I played there before the promo, uh, which actually had bits of that song,

247
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,440
used to be in Pensacola, Florida. And a month ago, they moved to Nashville, Tennessee,

248
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,000
uh, obviously amazing rock and roll. Uh, I'd like that very much, Brian Witt sent that into me,

249
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,960
so appreciate that Brian. Okay, you listening to the daily source code. My name's Adam Curry,

250
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,480
and he is another interesting podcast you might want to check out.

251
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,080
I'd now a public service announcement for listeners of the Daily Source Code.

252
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,160
Hi. My name is Chris. And like a lot of Americans, I have an elderly parent to take care of.

253
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Morning, son! Oh, hi, Dad. Where are you off to this morning? I'm going to do some yard work.

254
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,800
I got my plaid shorts, my black socks, and my white shoes on. I'm a sleeveless shirt.

255
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm going to get the Rototiller and Rototill the garden. Uh, Dad, we have a rooftop garden.

256
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,240
This is an apartment building. Oh, do we? Well, in that case, I'm off the Rototill the garden and put it

257
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,840
in a new skylight. See ya! As you can imagine, my father has some pretty strict and expensive

258
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,400
medication requirements. So expensive, in fact, that even with my health care coverage,

259
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,240
I just can't afford to keep up with his medication and we've had to cut back on his dosages.

260
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,480
And frankly, I don't think that's fair to someone who's contributed so much to our society.

261
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,800
It's senior citizens, like my father.

262
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,920
Hey, son, guess what? There already was a skylight up there. Yeah, I know, Dad.

263
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,240
Well, you got two now. I think I'll go put a third one in. Maybe over the baby's room.

264
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,720
By the way, how old is the baby now? He's 25, Dad. Yeah, they're so cute when they're that age.

265
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,440
So make sure to call your congressman and senator and tell them to vote for initiatives

266
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,680
that keep medication costs low and to protect our senior citizens. Thank you.

267
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:32,360
T-E-K-N-I-K-A-L-D-I-F-I-K-U-L-T-I-E-S. You are experiencing technical difficulties. Please stand by.

268
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,600
Makeins of each track or pot life, of course, talk about it and if you like and be promoted.

269
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,640
If not, you may attain a dignified science. So take a listen to next big thing, Radio at next big thing,

271
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,720
On is everyone in service, on our Canadian Bible opinion. I'm there as well through my questions. We're at them.

272
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,400
Yeah, right on. Okay, uh, I was, I was going to say, I was going to say something very prolific.

273
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
I'm sure a whole lot of seconds. Let me look at my notes again.

274
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,920
Oh, dude. Okay. I've told me to mess this up now.

275
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,440
Really, really done a bad job. I have some email that I wanted to read.

276
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,760
Hold on. Just bear with me, please. Again, my, my printers out.

277
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:47,160
And, oh man, I closed up the entire file of notes that I had.

278
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,160
Hold on. Oh, man. Maybe I should just leave it for what it is.

279
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,880
What I put that in. Where did I put it? Oh, here we go. Okay.

280
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:07,000
It's opening up kind of slowly. I have, I've really done a lot of rewiring in the studio. Okay. So now, of course,

281
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,200
the thing is like, frozen up. Ah, there we go. Don't you just hate it when you hear people messing

282
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,760
with their computer? It doesn't not just totally freaking suck. Okay, here we go.

283
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,800
There we go. Email from Joe Schmidt. This is interesting because this is going to put me on a

284
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,680
sound seeing tour. I love doing the sound seeing tour. Adam, first one, uh, you know, a source

285
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,520
co-blow, a boin, boin, boin, boin, boin. I don't drink coffee, but if I did, I would definitely buy a

286
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,600
senseo from you. I wanted to ask you, uh, if you had any information on the Millennium Vault 2000,

287
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,640
which is located in Guilford Castle. I recently had a post to my blog about the world's largest

288
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,440
time capsule. According to Google is located in a sewer in Nebraska and Joe lives in Omaha.

289
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,760
But I found that Guilford is home to the Millennium Vault 2000. It appears to be much bigger than

290
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,760
the one in Nebraska. A problem is it isn't very well documented on the net and I couldn't find

291
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,840
any pictures of it. So I thought I would ask you a Guilford local. If you had any, uh, to add any info

292
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,040
to add or pictures that I could see of the structure. So, uh, I'll put a link to your post, uh,

293
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,360
in the show notes, Joe, and I will definitely have a look. I had not, not been to the Guilford

294
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,880
castle yet. Um, so, uh, I say that's perfect for a sounding tour. Be on a look out for that sometime next.

295
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,040
Hey, Adam, this is another hit test and this one is created in the home studio with all the

296
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,160
equipment, uh, and it's probably the last time I'll be open. You got extra equipment at your house,

297
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,200
able to do that because this week is the first week of my rehabilitation program and I'll

298
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:55,560
only be taking my notebook and cast Blaster as you know. Um, because I don't know if I'll be having

299
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,560
internet access this first week. This hit test has been made in advance. Oh, by the way, thanks

300
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,040
Kevin for creating the, um, hit test announced the guy edition. It was fun creating it and it really

301
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,080
sounded great. I love the tour. And suddenly, everyone wants to do a hit test for me right now.

302
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,960
Don't let him do it, but certainly he's not going to happen. Oh, Russ, there is some special occasion

303
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,080
and, by the way, in the future, it's certainly possible that you'll be hearing a lot more from us

304
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,920
and that's Kevin and me then. Uh, okay, something going on there. As always, three intros and three

305
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:44,840
answers. All right, and this is number one. It sounds a little bit like rockwell, somebody's

306
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:57,560
watching me, but I couldn't really tell. And this is number two. Uh, okay, I give, give me a little more

307
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,400
than that. Yeah, and that's always impossible. And the final one, number three.

308
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,960
Stand by me. I think it's stand by me. And times up and this is answer number one.

309
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Yeah, it's rockwell. Got it.

310
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,480
And somewhere you can hear Michael Jackson's in the background, that's right. And they're

311
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,840
a good paranoid. Somebody's watching me. Like the paparazzi.

312
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,080
Somebody's watching me.

313
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,400
All right, well, and somebody's watching me. And so number one in today's hit test,

314
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,760
and answer number two is probably a bit difficult because the clip was very reassured.

315
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,000
It's the distinctive sound of the bass or the beginning of this track.

316
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,640
You gotta stand out.

317
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,040
You gotta stand out.

318
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,320
may be together, we can get somewhere. And ever places better.

319
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,360
Fatherly, we together you a neat find, we're the kind of dicen going on. We'll take a faster

320
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,920
record, and keep on grinding.

321
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,000
Several members would work out, down in your car to the back of the Mickey王.

322
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
See the lights stay out with both of them

323
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You're on the next map round my children

324
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh my god

325
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I'm feeling that I'm alone

326
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh my god

327
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And I'm feeling I could be someone

328
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Be someone

329
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's Rishi Chapman

330
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And her song, Fast Car

331
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And so number two in today's hit test

332
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And this is answer number three

333
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The zombie

334
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The zombie

335
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The time of the season

336
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Let it try

337
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
With pleasure

338
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's the time

339
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Of the season for love

340
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Answer number three in today's hit test

341
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The zombies and the time of the season

342
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And by the way all the intro and the clips

343
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Were partly edited by Richard

344
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Thank you

345
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And he'll be probably helping me out

346
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So with the editing stuff in the coming months

347
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Because it seems like I won't be having all the time I need

348
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
To create everything I need for the hit test

349
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, that's it then for today

350
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
As always, feedback is welcome at hittest.gmail.com

351
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And you can find the hittest and the hittest podcast

352
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And the information about it

353
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And the hittest podcast has been there for

354
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I guess more than a month now

355
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And I promise that

356
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
When I got the time

357
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
When I'm in Apple Doran

358
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll be creating one as soon as possible

359
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay, that's it then

360
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Thank you for listening

361
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And keep in mind that it's could be a week or so before

362
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The next one will be a week or so

363
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I hope I'll be able to create one sooner

364
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But it all depends on the internet access

365
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And when the line will be connected

366
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So thank you for listening

367
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000

368
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Pretty soon

478
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
My new dailysourcecode.com

479
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Site will be up

480
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Working hard on that behind the scenes

481
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Which means

482
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm done crap

483
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's up there

484
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's got to get some design going

485
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
If you've got a design

486
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Please

487
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'd love some help on that

488
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Feedback to me personally

A little low on the mashups these days

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But thanks to the serious show
