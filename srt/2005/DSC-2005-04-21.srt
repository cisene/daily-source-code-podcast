00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Daily source code Thursday April 21st, 2005.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
$60 million worth of airplane straps to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Transmeters?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We don't need not thinking crazy.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I like to think I'm sighing.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You can't hear anything.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm just taking it.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm curious.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey everybody, it's Thursday.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm at the cottage.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is your daily source code.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The power of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And we are back home.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How are you doing?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh my goodness.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm back on the mixing here.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
On the mixer board here.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And I'm trying to get every all the levels all straight now.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I'm working perfectly.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You like some bass?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Certainly got the bass in this one.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The power of the Lord is strong.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All right.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As promised, we just wind this down a little bit.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As promised, we have some sound seeing tour to take care of today.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I actually found out that the I River records things in the fashion that actually makes kind of an interesting to put together a sound seeing.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To remember now, I have this brand new microphone, the Griffin Stereo La Palo Mike.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Which I used yesterday during, well, basically the entire day.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Up in the morning, in the cab with Taxi Eric, a little bit of conversation there.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then meeting the Marines as they repelled from a helicopter.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And wound up the day with flight training, which actually that's part of the reason I went over.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As you know, I flew from Pharaohs, the airfield, not far from here from the cottage.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And that was with Wind Commander William for most of those two days.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I decided to rig up the recording for four touch and goes that we did at Tessel Airport, which is an island.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Just to the north of the Netherlands, to the north and a little bit to like northeast, which basically borders on the north sea.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But it has a beautiful long grass runway, so you can do all kinds of simulated engine failures and full flaps and no flaps landings.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And just about every single situation you might come across when you're flying.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Because the book of flying, man, I thought I knew all about it when I got my helicopter license.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Turns out there's a lot more to learn.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And we're also, you know, the Wind Commander is really teaching me in a fashion that sets me up to really understand how to get my instrument rating.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's a lot to it, and I think you'd enjoy because the sound with the stereo microphone really came out well.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm very, very pleased with, at least with parts of it.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The part would be in the airplane.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When the helicopter came over, we'll talk about that as I go through each bit.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So anyway, I recorded everything on the Iriver with the Griffin lapel microphone.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I'm still rolling here, yeah.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's good about is each time you stop the recording, it makes a new sound file.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So you don't wind up with one huge file, you know, that you have to kind of shuttle through and cue and everything.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I have all these different bits and I can just basically pull out each individual bit and play it.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I could have edited this all together, but I thought it would be a little more fun to talk about each piece and kind of do it live and on the fly.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I also took lots of pictures, which I'll include in the show notes.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I didn't do a synchronized sound seeing tour picture thing because the pictures were not all taken at exactly the same moment.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But it does give you a good overview of what happened and maybe they'll help you a little bit with the theater of the mind.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So you can, you know, if you don't know what a cougar helicopter looks like for instance, then, you know, you'll have a visual representation.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Because that's the kind of helicopter that the Marines came to use to repel down from to hand back the transmitter that we used in Iraq.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So it started yesterday in my hotel room, testing out the Griffin.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm getting ready for my good buddy, taxi Eric. He's, he's not just a driver.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Taxi Eric, not just a driver. He's a buddy.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And he's been a part of my radio shows doing sports reports and he really takes care of, he's taking care of our family in more ways than one. He's a really good guy.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Kind of like a gypsy ring.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you know what that is.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So the sound of the Griffin, no, I'm sorry, the bell.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Now, what is it, Griffin of the Griffin lapel mic is a little nasal. I'm not too happy about it.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There's using it just for a plain old sound seeing, but it did work very well for some of the other stuff that we did today.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So or did yesterday. So let's have a listen as my day start off early in the morning in my hotel room in Utrecht.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, good morning. It is the 20th of April, 2005, relatively short night after the last time that we spoke.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm up and about in my hotel in Utrecht here.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And today is the day that we meet the Marines as they come repelling down from the sky.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I figured I'd try and capture some of that on, well, you can't really say on tape anymore, can you?

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Catching it on the flash recorder on the I River, of course.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So hearing is actually a little balcony on in the room.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can kind of hear the morning sounds of Utrecht, it's raining, of course.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I can see people across the street already in their offices.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's 10 minutes to nine.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And there's some construction going on in the background.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Skies are gray, cloudy, not very nice.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay. So we'll continue.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We're on our way in the next segment.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes. And then I went down for a quick breakfast.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And Eric had his car at the ready.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And we had to drive to the radio station, radio Veronica.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's the station that we did a whole week's worth of live broadcast from Camp Smitty in Iraq from.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And just refresh your memory when we left, we left behind my personal FM transmitter.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a 100 watt transmitter at the base, all set up with a satellite dish.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So they could receive the Dutch radio signal for 24 hours a day.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And the radio station throughout the entire mission that the Marines and their other troops, other Dutch troops were there.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We were handing out weather reports, traffic reports for Camp Smitty and Asamaba, which is the province that Camp Smitty lies in.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So there really was a bridge that we built between, between the everyone back home and all the troops far over sea.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, not really overseas, I guess, far over the desert.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Something that is very uncommon in the Netherlands because there's no support for armed, there's no respect really.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, the way, and when I grew up in the States, you have respect for the police officer.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You have respect for the firemen.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You have respect for men and women in military service.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you have respect for your teacher.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then, of course, you get your religious leaders and all that.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But there is an in bread respect for these people, which does not exist.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And predominantly socialist countries.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And it turns out that respect really, people want to do it, but it's not fashionable.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not done.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You don't talk about that because that's bad and the war machine.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And my whole thinking is, hey, we might need these guys one day.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Maybe even at home, so perhaps we should have a little bit of respect for them.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And the Ministry of Defense caught onto that.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And, of course, they took the ball and ran with it.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They saw the good PR.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They could get out of it.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was a great experience without a doubt radio history in the Netherlands.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Very proud of that.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And now that the Dutch troops are done with their mission.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They've been there for two years in Iraq.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now they're back.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The Brits and the Japanese have taken over Camp Smidi.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I believe.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And so, it's like last, well, last guy out, turned off the lights.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And, oh yeah, we've got to take the FM transmitter back to Curry.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That was kind of what this was all about, just winding up the entire Iraqi mission.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And you can hear, by the way, the dynamics of that microphone.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We've got to figure out something.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And whenever a little bit of wind hits it and wait until you hear the downwash from the helicopter,

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
it just starts to fluctuate.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And you can almost feel the membranes rocking back and forth in your eardrums.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
By the way, if you're not listening to this podcast on ear buds or headphones,

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I suggest you do, because really with sound seeing tours,

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that's what you want.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You want to be in the experience.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So just listen to it at your computer or, you know, on speakers, you won't get the full effect.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But let's continue now.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And with a little bit of conversation with taxi-eric on our way to the radio station.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And you'll notice a recurring theme throughout the today's show.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Which is the Pope.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is a testing.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh boy.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It is so sensitive.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The minute I start to breathe into this microphone, it just goes nuts.

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, the good thing about this mic is that, in today, it's good because it's white.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I'm wearing a white shirt.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So it's actually better than the normal black lapel mic that I have on.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But you can really tell when the wind hits it.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's going to be tough with the helicopter.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, I see Eric down there.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think he just arrived.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Teach the E.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You can't hear it.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Eat it.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yo, eat it.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey, dude.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, I have a coffee coffee.

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm eliminated.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, so I guess you got that part right there.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That was basically me inviting him for some coffee.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And now we're done now.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We're getting into the car.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can hear it.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hello.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think I've told you about that taxi system before.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, the cab drivers basically hand work off to each other through cell phones.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And since they're all on the same cell phone network,

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
they don't pay anything for calls amongst themselves.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So it's a very efficient and cost effective way of business.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I'm not too happy with this weather.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's just shit.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is a typical Dutch.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And Eric is a typical Dutch day for weather as yet.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Very bad.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's raining.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's not too much wind.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a little bit foggy.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
There's no way to fly that I think.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What do you mean for the helicopter?

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That won't be a problem.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Is there any problem getting out of the helicopter?

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because there is one that's pretty foggy.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, I mean, essentially no.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, we can fly IFR.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can fly in the complete blind if he wants to.

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Never get you do that.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just don't know how long.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, not last very long.

190
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So right now we're driving from Utrecht to Niner.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And that's where we'll pick up the rest of the crew that went with us to Iraq.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then from there we go over to whatever the rendezvous point is.

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You don't know what that is, do you?

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Somebody in the field because we're talking about the big helicopter.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Cougars.

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I guess a Cougar is a reason.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's not a Chinook.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's really big.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But the Cougars are going to be reasonably big.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't give you my camera, Iraq.

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you take pictures?

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Pictures of myself.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Can I be able to cook with me, man?

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Right.

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I take pictures, but you show me how to work.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, please.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You were showing me how it worked yesterday.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What did you zoom in?

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Believe me.

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's idiot proof.

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It is.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, then get these cameras have gotten really good.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Do you think there's going to be any TV?

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Show you.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, well, the Ministry of Defense sent out to press release.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Presently.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It was for the first time.

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We're going to give something big.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, come on us, not fair.

229
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But yeah, the minute I said, yeah, I'll be there.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I confirmed.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Press release is started going out.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's like they're really trying to make the army image.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, I mean, they really mean this.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I know that.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I know they really mean this.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But they are taking advantage of the situation.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You guys kind of the same way.

238
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We took advantage of the situation.

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, going to Iraq was good for them and good for us.

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Good for everybody.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Good for the station, too.

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't deny it.

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't deny it.

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't deny it, sir.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I love the cigar.

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So they were just driving along the highway.

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And of course, he run into some typical Dutch traffic situations along the way.

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, so we're still in the car.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're in a typical Dutch situation, which is a traffic jam.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Actually, it's not that bad today.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So, Eric, how's everything going in Holland?

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Everything is going pretty good.

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We are pretty happy with the German boat.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like a boat, man.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You know, like the German boat?

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't like the German.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

258
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not telling these.

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You weren't even born in the second world war, man.

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're talking about it.

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, the boat was okay, but why don't they pick someone who's a little bit younger?

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
A younger boat?

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How old is this guy?

264
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is what?

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
78.

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
78?

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, I know why.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why?

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We have to choose another one.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Exactly.

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How many Cardinals are there?

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
100?

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
More 140?

274
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah.

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think 200?

276
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
200?

277
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So all those guys would potentially like to be the Pope.

279
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Right?

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I would like to go ahead to die already.

281
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, you know, it's like, you know, let's not have to wait around for 30 years before we have another shot.

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Maybe they still have a chance.

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Maybe something like that, I don't know.

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Is it due to my age?

285
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No, I doubt it.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's, I'm sure it's like any big corporation.

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But I mean, how powerful is the Pope?

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Can he decide to die himself?

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Decide what?

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, whatever.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Whatever.

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, no.

293
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, yeah, he, of course, he's powerful.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah.

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, you're not dead anymore.

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I mean, you're not dead anymore.

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know what I mean?

298
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, I would hope that he has a direct connection to the man.

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I mean, yeah.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You become Pope.

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So right now it's 10 o'clock, which is good.

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I like being fashion-related.

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
A real star.

305
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

306
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
A real star always comes late.

307
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

308
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's what you're driving me.

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

311
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So now the traffic is moving.

312
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And actually, this doesn't sound too bad on the,

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
on the Griffin lapel microphone.

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It sounds a little bit better.

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Excuse me.

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It sounds a little bit better than yesterday.

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The acoustics also have changed, which I'm sure makes a difference.

318
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
From the hotel room to the car.

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The window is cracked a little bit.

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So that's the sound you're hearing.

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Close the window?

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's okay.

323
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, wow.

324
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Penal to the middle, Eric.

325
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And instantly, the diesel force cylinder springs to life.

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah.

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah.

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's always fun to not taxi drivers cab, you know,

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
tell them that he has a shitty cab with a shitty engine.

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So then we arrived at the radio station.

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was blown away.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They were walled wall, soldiers, marines, air force, ground troops.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They had jeeps, camouflaged vehicles.

334
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And this was becoming a really big production.

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And so we hung out in front of the building for, I don't know,

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
about 20 minutes, drinking coffee, just shooting a shit, you know,

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
with all these guys.

338
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Some of them who we met in Iraq, others were new.

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And they were just along for the ride,

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
or providing support for this show that we're putting it on for us.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And so, unfortunately, a lot of what I recorded is in Dutch,

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
which I'm not going to play all of just little bits.

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I did hook up with a couple of the crew members.

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm going to play a bit now from a short conversation I had with

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Michiel Feinstra.

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He was a member of the morning crew,

347
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and he still does the morning show with another host now.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And also, has his own,

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
he actually, he wanted a marconi award,

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
a coveted marconi award for the work that he does on the radio

351
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and the Netherlands.

352
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And we had a quick conversation in Dutch just about our impressions of the day,

353
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and what we were going to expect,

354
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we call him Mike Veinstra.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We're here in front of the Veronica Radio Studios,

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and offices.

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The broadcast tower at tower light.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is, I mean, he'll think so.

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Mike, Mike Veinstra?

360
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

361
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What the fuck is going on?

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I didn't expect this.

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You did?

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No.

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No, I mean, I expected, like, we'd all hook up,

366
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and then we go over to the field,

367
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
there's, like, 20 marines.

368
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

369
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh, they're so grateful.

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And the police escort.

371
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, I didn't know that either.

372
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's pretty cool.

373
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's pretty cool.

374
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, I know that the military are so grateful.

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is it, John?

376
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, like it?

377
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

378
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

379
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What is it for?

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's for Bart.

381
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How is Bartcyc?

382
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Of Focconi.

383
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, LED.

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah.

385
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Fingers.

386
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to think about it.

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah.

390
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah.

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I mean, NAB.

392
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We're not playing cards.

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

395
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, I think.

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What's your career?

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah.

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I can put my studio microphone.

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's hot like that.

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay.

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Have you been playing?

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah.

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Do you want to talk to me?

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Do you want to talk to me?

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
All right.

408
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That was a small interruption

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
by one of Holland's most famous DJs,

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and he's a special fan.

411
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He's a fan.

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He's a fan.

413
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He's a fan.

414
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He's a fan.

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's a fan.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Now, it's a big surprise for me as well to see so many of the military show up on.

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But I guess that just on the lines, how grateful they are for us going there over a year ago, leaving the transmitter there, receiver.

418
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It wasn't a big deal.

419
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I mean, it was more fun for us, I thought.

420
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It was great.

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But the transmitter, I guess, that really did help them.

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I mean, after we left the transmitter, so they could still tune into radio Veronica.

425
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And over the year, E-mail message just came coming in from Cam Smith from the guys saying, thank you for the music.

426
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The songs you're singing.

427
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Thanks for all the joy or bringing it.

428
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So, yeah, I guess they are.

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So let me, yeah.

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's probably a much more big deal to them than me.

431
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Then we realized.

432
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, that's true.

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's true.

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So the setup here is we've got a black hummer with our logo on it.

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Of course, it's a radio station.

436
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

437
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's a really big logo.

438
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It has listen now.

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Cute in.

440
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And just to bet with it, we've got to put the frequency on as well.

441
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So what time is it now?

442
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's 1030.

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So those guys already left for the field?

444
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Already checked the spot earlier this morning.

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So I should know how to get there.

447
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Are you driving?

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay.

450
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You're trying to persuade me.

451
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm not driving.

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No.

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
To me, he was only had his license for about a year and a half.

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, not a make that a year.

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Where's your car?

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Do you see that thing?

457
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, that's it.

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, there it is.

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Pimped out.

460
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.

461
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So one of the stars in a big guitar at the back.

462
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Is that the Dutch version of Pimped my ride?

463
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Got a hold of your car?

464
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's the Dutch sheep.

465
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No, butchard version.

466
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh, I'm going to ride.

467
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The late late late late.

468
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Late night version.

469
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, my ride.

470
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The cool thing is.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But then he just got some stickers and threw it on there.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He takes a fence and it and says, hey, it's a clear pimp.

473
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But the cool thing is, instead of exhibit, we got this cool chick.

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're in.

475
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Right.

476
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, we know her.

477
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So that's the one good thing about the big bird.

478
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The big bird.

479
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Mike.

480
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There you go.

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So that's a little bit of a setup there.

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
As we were just about to take off to go to the field where we are rendezvous point.

483
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, when we arrived there, it was just, you know, there was it was cord noff.

484
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There was just troops everywhere.

485
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Police escorts.

486
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It was really, I was blown away.

487
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
In fact, I was humbled completely humbled by this.

488
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Now, if you thought the wind was bad in that recording.

489
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Wait until you hear the downwash of the rotor blades of a cougar helicopter.

490
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I tried to narrate a little bit of it.

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You hear photographers yelling at me because they want to get a picture of me looking at the helicopter,

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
which, of course, I totally ignored.

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm like, God damn it.

494
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Can't you guys just, you know, get your own shot, you know, do something, like do some work?

495
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They're very lazy over there.

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They'll, they'll, I think most celebrities in Holland will do anything to get their picture in the paper.

497
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And this to me, although, of course, I knew it was going to be a press moment.

498
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This was really about the guys who we have the utmost respect for.

499
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So what you're about to hear now, and again, I apologize.

500
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I've still got to figure out a way to put a wind screen on this thing.

501
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I'm going to ask Patricia again if she can help me with like a panty hose, wind screen or something over the, the lapel microphone.

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You hear the cougar come over first.

503
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You'll hear some background of me just talking with people.

504
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Then you'll hear it land.

505
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I, or actually the, the repelling down of four of these marines.

506
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And I'll, I'll let it play for a little bit at a certain point.

507
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's just so much touching it that I don't think it'll make a lot of sense.

508
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But enjoy this, because the sound, it isn't stereo,

509
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and it did come across reasonably well.

510
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Again, some downwash and the griffin eye mic.

511
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It might, it may make your, your, your, your drums vibrate a little bit.

512
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But now crank it up and enjoy.

513
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
As we say, if you can't cover it up.

514
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Turn it up.

515
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh man.

516
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay, here comes the helicopter.

517
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Full hunchmark.

518
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Holy moly.

519
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Thank you.

520
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Thank you.

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I've been to their coal.

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh man.

523
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Nice to come here.

524
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

525
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
My next one is it.

526
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you.

527
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So it's turning and making a 360.

528
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's coming in for the cover, so you can see the doors are open, there's two guys on this side.

529
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
In the walkin of the top.

530
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Tohisseld..

531
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Open is always close to the left and right.

532
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, no!

533
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
My opening is good!

534
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Get it cut!

535
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I got the whole man!

536
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Brother are coming down!

537
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm just so full!

538
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's funny!

539
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Put down!

540
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Second and third are coming down!

541
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll just run their hole!

542
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Come back here on!

543
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's unbelievable!

544
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5,

545
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I can't sneak against that!

546
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Back on the hook!

547
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Drop the flyers!

548
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I can sneak against that man's problem with me!

549
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The car goes with the same load!

550
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay!

551
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Go!

552
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Drop the flyers!

553
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Stand up for fire down!

554
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Aachon!

555
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hey there!

556
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm dead in the NBA!

557
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Nice trail to finish!

558
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You're working on this.

559
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Whether it's war or not.

560
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,360
This car will be San Francisco-

561
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm so happy she said the dude was in for a test

562
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,200
he's gonna close it

563
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,720
I think they are meeting with things like this

564
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,600
Don't worry.

565
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,540
and then they won't touch anything

566
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,780
Don't say no to any time

567
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,940
Why are you laughing?

568
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,720
I've been so blogs lately

569
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm not gonna see you

570
00:26:49,540 --> 00:27:19,400
That was a little piece there of the commander who was actually going to hand the

571
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,040
transmitter to me once it was delivered by the Marines from the helicopter and he reiterated

572
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,720
exactly what we discovered there he said it was so great to get up in the morning in the

573
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,920
middle of the desert you know it's blazing hot you turn on the radio and of course they had

574
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,520
just regular transistor radios within they couldn't receive anything except one

575
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:44,200
transistor one transmission from a mosque which was pretty much mosque music and he said

576
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,040
it was great because you know you flip on the radio and then you hear the weather report you

577
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,880
also hear you know what the weather was going to be in camp smithy that day he said it was

578
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,360
you know it's almost like not being in the middle of the desert and that's of course

579
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,000
something that only the magic of radio can bring although it would have worked perfectly what

580
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,480
would pod casting as well I presume so you can hear that the cougar helicopter after he dropped

581
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,400
the former rains out he the helicopter landed and then from that I was just you know

582
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,960
basically shaken hands talking to everybody talking about our time there and yeah just kind

583
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,880
of getting re-acquated so when you hear all of this stuff there's you hear those choppers

584
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,200
coming over there's only one song you can play right a little bit of break and we'll be

585
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,240
back with more sound seeing from the sess no 182

586
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:58,680
although I might be the lapping loud and hot air deep inside and blue

587
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:09,880
so take a good look at my face you see my smile you saw a lot of place in the

588
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:17,800
close for the season to change the chance of my team

589
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,000
I need you to be me

590
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,400
since you let me up you see me with another girl

591
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,400
see me like I'm having fun

592
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:52,280
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah

593
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:02,920
oh

594
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,880
yeah

595
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Oh, it's fading, it's just the power that you put me down

596
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:36,280
My smile is my wake-up, I wear since my break-up with you

597
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,280
There's a text with blood, with your smile

598
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Oh, so I know if you're my smile, I'm inside of you

599
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Yeah, don't know, it's the same as you did

600
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,280
All the chats of my team, baby

601
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Baby, baby, baby, baby, take the blood

602
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,280
All in love, yes, oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

603
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

604
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
You're welcome, let's go, let's go, let's go

605
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Smoking Robinson and the miracles, the tracks of my tears

606
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Of course, from the tour of Duties soundtrack

607
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,280
Just always hear that song whenever, whenever I hear chopper blades

608
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Roofing through the air

609
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
So, once that was done, we went back from another quick cup of coffee

610
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,280
We hung out, talked a little bit more, and then, by that time

611
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
The Wing Commander had flown up from Antwerp

612
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Where the Sessna is hangered, where he has his operations

613
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,280
And of course, we're going to do at least another four or five hours of flight training

614
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Now, just to set this up properly

615
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,280
I have a helicopter license, I've flown over 700 hours on turbine helicopters

616
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,280
But it is a big difference between flying a helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft

617
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,280
And particularly the way the Wing Commander is teaching me

618
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Because the first thing he did is he said, okay, no digital jockey shit

619
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,280
He took away the GPS, it's all being done on VORs

620
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,280
So that means that you're basically using World War II technology

621
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,280
And instruments, complete instrument navigation

622
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,280
And it's very important to learn how to fly

623
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:19,280
And the most important part of flying, if you've ever done a flight in a light weight aircraft

624
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,280
It's actually not too hard getting off the ground

625
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I think just about everybody could probably get an airplane airborne

626
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,280
With an hour or two of less, and you can probably learn straight and level flight

627
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Which is the first thing you learn, and then you're banking

628
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Because you can definitely bank too far and you can turn yourself upside down

629
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
There is some stuff to be learned there

630
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,280
But the most important part is landing and landing is not just landing

631
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,280
You have all kinds of different airfield situations

632
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
It could be a short field, it could be a soft field

633
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Meaning a grass field, it could be a really long field

634
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
You could have an engine failure

635
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,280
You could, well today we actually had quite a bit of wind

636
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,280
So we did some exercises, which you normally would not ever do in high winds

637
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
But there may be a reason for it

638
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,280
So essentially you're training for all, you know, it's expected that's basically what it is

639
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,280
And you're still never going to finish the whole book that is aviation

640
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
You learn with every single flight, I think you learn something new

641
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,280
So what I did for this particular bit, and we're going to do four touching goes

642
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,280
As I stuck the Griffin lapel mic into my headset

643
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,280
And it turned out really cool, first of all there's no wind noise

644
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,280
So none of that, you know, vibrating ear drum stuff

645
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,280
But you also were able to hear a good combination of the outside air noise, the engine

646
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
As well as what's going on on the cockpit

647
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,280
And I asked the wind commander who was very proficient at English

648
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Of course most pilots have to speak English, but he's good at it

649
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Oops, hold on a second

650
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I'll have to call that person back, whoever it is

651
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,280
We did that instruction in English

652
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I think he kept going English all the way through

653
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Now this is not so, I mean you're thinking probably okay

654
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,280
And I'm going to listen to some flying stuff of a flying sound

655
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Seeing tour, what I really liked about this, and I listened to it twice

656
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
First of all, as a student someone who's learning

657
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
It was very, very helpful to go back and I remember of course

658
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Every single situation, I remember every climb, every descent, every landing

659
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
All the parts of it

660
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,280
It's great to be able to go back and listen to what my instructor was telling me

661
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Every single time, because now I was forgetting some really crucial things

662
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
If you're a pilot, you'll know that the carb heat is a lifesaver

663
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
You can't forget pulling the carb heat

664
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Which basically you want heat to go through your carburetors

665
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Especially when you're landing

666
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Whenever you're doing a slow flight maneuver

667
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Because it can ice up, even if it can be easily 75 degrees outside

668
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
And you can still get icing in your carburetor

669
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,280
So that's something that I forgot once or twice

670
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
And that's just something you can't forget

671
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,280
That could cause a real bad day

672
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,280
So one other thing I want, so what's beautiful about this

673
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Is the relationship between student and teacher

674
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,280
That's really what I like hearing in this particular sound

675
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Seeing tour

676
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,280
And by the way, whenever William says it's an incident

677
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,280
I think he meant, well, what I know what he means

678
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,280
He's basically saying, oh, that's a coincidence

679
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
A coincidence is that you landed so nicely

680
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
A coincidence that you happen to be on course

681
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,280
So that's kind of his way of saying, okay, good job

682
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,280
So listen now to some touching goes, a Tesla airport

683
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
As we taxi out to the field first

684
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
The wing commander William and myself in our Cessna 182RG

685
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Well, the brakes?

686
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Yeah, no, go half to no

687
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Good afternoon, wing commander William

688
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Yes, sir, we are

689
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
You ready to rock and roll?

690
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Okay, okay, ready to check out the Tesla airport

691
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,280
Tesla number 277, Delta share, ready to check?

692
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,280
That's a good idea, don't wait for it

693
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Five as well, zero four, we're doing four touching goes

694
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,280
If what it pots you to a helicopter

695
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,280
And you know, okay, ready?

696
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Roll, roll, sir, roll and we are

697
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Okay, press and check

698
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Mr. John makes a rich slaps up

699
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Up to the car, please

700
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Break us off, okay, it's okay

701
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
It's a power of a belly

702
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Fuck again, it makes a kick of your sight

703
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Makes a change on my side, my sped is wrong

704
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Oh, baby, we take the right

705
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
We take the right

706
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
All

707
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,280
The point is, I guess, and I'm gonna go around that

708
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Okay, lovely Tesla airport, whether it's very nice today

709
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Nice bit of wind

710
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
It's about 20 knots crosswind on the landing

711
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,280
18 gusts and up 43

712
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,280
He goes about 75, 80 degrees

713
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
And he's out the car, I'm confused

714
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
He's heading until you reach the runway

715
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
That's just a problem, I don't wait for the right to check

716
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,280
He along the runway to fill the first runway markers

717
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
That's all complete, we go straight ahead

718
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,280
And just before the runway we turn to the right to the right

719
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,280
85 degrees, if you have any options

720
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
And then just before the markers

721
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
We pick up the center line for a couple of tips

722
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
And go to the center of the ocean

723
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
I don't click this at all, sir

724
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
That's great

725
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
Yes, there's a one as on this grass

726
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Yeah

727
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Okay, you don't need to do any cags to be close

728
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,280
We just, we just have to float here

729
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,280
We have to set this here, right now

730
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Okay, that's one as sufficient

731
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,280
But wait for me at him, so we'll take a left here

732
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Okay

733
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,280
I keep it going again, I have to go about 20 to three slabs

734
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
And there's no one coming in

735
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Oh, I'm always all clean

736
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
There we go, sir

737
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Okay

738
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
That's the stick into the wind, shall

739
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
There we go

740
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Power is coming out

741
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Thank you, power

742
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Thank you, power is in power

743
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,280
It's sufficient, it's been getting to the slide

744
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Okay, if you have a tight snowy, okay

745
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
You feel the air comes to the wind

746
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Yeah, we have a positive, not the opposite

747
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Rakes, we get up the brakes

748
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,280
We get all the crutes, we get the crutes, we get the crutes

749
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Now, you're evenly sliced on your sleeves

750
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Behind the BET

751
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Behind the BET

752
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Okay, see, let's set them

753
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,280
You try to set them down, okay you're set them

754
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,280
You want to set them right

755
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Can't be the�ęstreight

756
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Oh, okay, now we won't inté datas

757
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Why does it reflected inside?

758
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
Oh, really?

759
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
I'm...

760
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Okay, okay, if you have 500 each, try to lift me tight, right

761
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,280
By my material on the left, I'm sure what you make, live it, it's free, live it and thank it.

762
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,280
The negating speed is 85, it's better, 80.

763
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,280
But the bank is making the place that it's okay.

764
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,280
The downlink speed today, and the digital consensus is rated temperature.

765
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,280
It's one of the most indigating, okay.

766
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
It's okay.

767
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,280
What does 80 knowing how to bend it one, two, five?

768
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,280
What does the speed coming up to?

769
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,280
85, one of the nuts, power bank, you make it putty, one, twenty-two, which is which you're right for right.

770
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,280
And now we have the left turning right, the downlink.

771
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,280
But if we turn left, turn right for the downlink.

772
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Yes, we turn right and right.

773
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm so right.

774
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Okay.

775
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
You're gonna get me left.

776
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Where you from?

777
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Yes.

778
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
I won't roast you.

779
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Okay.

780
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
I'll make a roll on our trail.

781
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
So put your nose about to sit.

782
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Take it out to church and you want the front of the street and front of the front.

783
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
I want 100 knots of the downlink.

784
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
That's it.

785
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,280
And those left might get more density to the place.

786
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,280
And then you need to dodge the walk.

787
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
There's a red arrow there.

788
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
That is the water.

789
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
Just before you have to get it.

790
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Okay.

791
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
You'll have to set your right for the future.

792
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
But they downlink, so okay.

793
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Now it's just one.

794
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Brakes on the church.

795
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,280
And there are three green and a couple more things for you.

796
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Those two had to kick you and intent the left.

797
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
And the left are okay too.

798
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Blest.

799
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
But I think nicely.

800
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
You can't.

801
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
Or these.

802
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Or these.

803
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Okay.

804
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
And then we.

805
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,280
You're so powered and we can be sending them to the right.

806
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
And we're just powered.

807
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
There's a little bit.

808
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,280
A little bit of warmth left to make it about the 18 to the punch in the grease.

809
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
That's such.

810
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
That is final.

811
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
That can't pass.

812
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
That can't.

813
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Such.

814
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Right you.

815
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Watch.

816
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Watch.

817
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
That can't be gross.

818
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Because we don't want to offline that.

819
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
That we should know.

820
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Should somebody don't want to offline the people.

821
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Well.

822
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
I don't care about the people I am.

823
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Okay.

824
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Okay.

825
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Let's do it.

826
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
We're going to go in.

827
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
We're going to go in.

828
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
We're going to go in.

829
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
We're going to go in.

830
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
We're going to go in.

831
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Okay.

832
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I need.

833
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Not to smoke it.

834
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
It's in a form.

835
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Okay.

836
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
What you do.

837
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
What you do is you're out of your dog.

838
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
It's bleeding.

839
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
You're going now.

840
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
You need to be reducing.

841
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
It's the.

842
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Okay.

843
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm going to.

844
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
You have to.

845
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Try.

846
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
We have a promise.

847
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
On the carriage.

848
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
We have.

849
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
You have.

850
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Yeah.

851
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
And reducing the 80 knots.

852
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
Yes, sir.

853
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
What would you do if you win?

854
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
You quit right here.

855
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Well.

856
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
And pull the nose up a little bit.

857
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Blind him.

858
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Should be on the quiet right here.

859
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
Tell him.

860
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
Let's rest.

861
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Play for him to save you there.

862
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
So that's it.

863
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
We have a new pump.

864
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Oh yeah.

865
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Nice.

866
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Somebody is so aware.

867
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Okay.

868
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
I'm going to lose.

869
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
What do you want?

870
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Yeah.

871
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
And.

872
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Are you that?

873
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
You reduce a little bit.

874
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Power to the power.

875
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
And.

876
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
And you're the right side of the center line.

877
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
The European.

878
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Yes.

879
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Well.

880
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
I agree.

881
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
But now I was wondering.

882
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
You did it.

883
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
You did it.

884
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
It's not.

885
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Okay.

886
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
Your city.

887
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
I got this.

888
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Come on.

889
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Yes.

890
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
It's very loud.

891
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
It's loud in us.

892
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Yeah.

893
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280

Okay.

917
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
And.

918
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
And.

919
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
And.

And.

938
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:05,280
I don't see those things really, but it's a bad open dude.

939
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
I don't think so.

940
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
I'm gonna approach you.

941
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
What does it mean?

942
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
I don't think so.

943
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
I don't think so.

944
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
I'm gonna approach you.

945
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,280
What does it mean?

946
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
I don't think so.

947
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
I don't think so.

948
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,280
I'm gonna approach you.

949
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,280
What does it mean?

950
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280
I don't think so.

951
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
I don't think so.

952
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
I don't think so.

953
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
I don't think so.

954
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I don't think so.

955
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
It means the mount down with anything what shouldn't mean.

956
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,280
It's going to be right here, which should be about zero.

957
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
So you're zero.

958
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
That sounded amazing.

959
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Wait.

960
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Detrict.

961
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
יש button again.

962
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:51,280
When you control the controlangle

963
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,080
It won't keep doing it yet, it won't show it yet, it won't look a great green

964
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,380
100 knots

965
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,080
That's true, okay

966
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
That's true

967
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,080
Of course you

968
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,680
Okay, you can let them down if you're like

969
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:09,880
Okay, and just don't the guy that you turned in, I can't do base for the ditch, no, it was hit on the floor

970
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,480
Another but 277, got the share, turn in, right hand, base for touch and go with 0-4

971
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,380
Although

972
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Okay, keep, keep to turn you

973
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Okay, I want to reduce a little bit, I don't know what to do

974
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
We'll see you in the next few days, take care of yourself

975
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,780
Okay, what do you think is in the other shoe to know for sure to do a center line?

976
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,780
Fucking right under the middle of the center line now, okay, pick up, pick up the heading to zero

977
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
And then five, get a 4-5

978
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,780
And let's wait for you to do a center line, you see what I'm doing

979
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Uh, I mean, you're a 4-5

980
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Reducing speed

981
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Yeah, I'm gonna

982
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,780
Okay, you're aiming for which speed

983
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
Okay, anything I can get

984
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,280
99, 90, 90s

985
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,780
And yeah, the other mountain goes so well, and then you're using slowly to achy

986
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,780
And then remember what I told you, you're doing lunch set

987
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,280
If you reduce the power, if you reduce the speed, you have to

988
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,280
Increase the angle of the pack, slowly

989
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:24,280
If it's some power, and it's, that will do, that will do, that will do

990
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
Okay, slowly bring it to the runway

991
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Watch, think it down, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

992
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Let it go, this is an height of control, letting you see

993
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,280
Okay, can I see a camera set, you have control, I show you

994
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,280
I show you the landing up, look, look, look, look, look, look, look

995
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,320
Yeah, I get it, that's you, did you sooner down, you should impossible to control, right

996
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah, sure I mean, yeah

997
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Can you do this for demonstration?

998
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Okay, this is possible at a earlier station, you know, it goes,position, cool, yeah

999
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:36,280
I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here, but I'm not sure if you're gonna get that wrong here,

1000
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,740
Ahmm...

1001
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:48,900
But it's just pretty exciting, 85' thought it's very easy to edit, oh great look it's pretty pretty, pretty fun, champ

1002
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,640
Now we have just 3 oh 4 inch low on that line.

1003
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,960
And then Сейчас that line then back there

1004
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:28,960
I have to take off the checks and land power, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

1005
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:58,960
at the right, come on, come on, come on, come here I saw this exception, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come have it, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

1006
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,960
And right, let's go to the right, and space, just walk the people out here.

1007
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
Yeah.

1008
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,960
There are my 277 Delta share and 20 right hand.

1009
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,960
And space touching out onto your phone.

1010
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,960
And the right hand.

1011
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,960
And then the share of mine share with that, you set it up into the line.

1012
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
24 knots, 24 knots, so for a good job, share.

1013
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,960
Okay.

1014
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,960
And can't you speed, sir?

1015
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
Yes.

1016
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Or you can back to 80.

1017
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Now, just don't back to 80.

1018
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,960
Wait, you're making it happen.

1019
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Good.

1020
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
Some flaps.

1021
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,960
Good.

1022
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Okay.

1023
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
That's enough.

1024
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Keep on turning.

1025
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,960
Keep on turning.

1026
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,960
Okay.

1027
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,960
Now let it go.

1028
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
Bro.

1029
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,960
You're slightly above to fly across your hand.

1030
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,960
This is all of an aircraft.

1031
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
There's our answer.

1032
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Okay.

1033
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,960
If I'm a big deal, it's final clear.

1034
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,960
Me.

1035
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Very, yeah.

1036
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Same up to final.

1037
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,960
Short final.

1038
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,960
So you'll be there in a couple of seconds.

1039
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
Okay.

1040
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,960
That's one of my questions.

1041
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,960
Thank you.

1042
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,960
Do you want to local?

1043
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Okay.

1044
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Speed back 75.

1045
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
Keep it going.

1046
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
He's only five.

1047
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,960
And the black and build up was the aircraft.

1048
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,960
I wrote it.

1049
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,960
Okay.

1050
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,960
But what else?

1051
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,960
Blow it with us.

1052
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,960
And 75.

1053
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
That is the minimum.

1054
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Because the wind is blasting.

1055
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Yeah.

1056
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,960
And the transform.

1057
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,960
Because it's a very tricky aircraft.

1058
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,960
If you have full flaps on my girlfriend's situation.

1059
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,960
If you stay in control until you're about half an incident there.

1060
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,960
About the aggression.

1061
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Better down.

1062
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,960
Lower your nose.

1063
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
Okay.

1064
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Better down.

1065
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,960
Final kicks.

1066
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,960
You've got them no problem.

1067
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Better down.

1068
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Okay.

1069
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,960
And fly just over to the main ground.

1070
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
Left.

1071
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
Okay.

1072
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,960
Keep going.

1073
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
Keep going.

1074
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Keep going.

1075
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Okay.

1076
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Keep going.

1077
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Keep going.

1078
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
All right.

1079
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
There we go.

1080
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,960
There we go.

1081
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Flaps wall.

1082
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Okay.

1083
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
Composition.

1084
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
Okay.

1085
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Keep going.

1086
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,960
Keep going.

1087
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,960
Okay.

1088
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,960
We are positive.

1089
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,960
Okay.

1090
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
Break.

1091
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Break.

1092
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
Yeah.

1093
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Okay.

1094
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Okay.

1095
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,960
What is your speed?

1096
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
Okay.

1097
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,960
What is your speed?

1098
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
They didn't.

1099
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,960
They understeed the flaps.

1100
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,960
No, sir.

1101
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,960
That he right.

1102
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
He was number three.

1103
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
That was number three.

1104
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,960
The wind is not on clear.

1105
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,960
He didn't.

1106
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
And the first.

1107
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
He didn't.

1108
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
He didn't.

1109
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
He didn't.

1110
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,960
He didn't.

1111
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,960
And I.

1112
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
I don't share here.

1113
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,960
Hey.

1114
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Okay.

1115
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
Yeah.

1116
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
25.

1117
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,460
Yes.

1118
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
There we go.

1119
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
There we go.

1120
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,960
I think I've been taking the distance better.

1121
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,960
But I don't want to go to the city.

1122
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,960
I want shall we go for the midship.

1123
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,960
Subway to the engine.

1124
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,960
Fill your nation.

1125
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Okay.

1126
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,960
Stay up.

1127
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
Stay down.

1128
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,960
Be quick.

1129
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Subway neither.

1130
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
Okay you didn't you.

1131
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Come sleeping.

1132
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
Okay, now is up.

1133
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
You that no is absiu and push.

1134
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Do we are okay?

1135
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,960
You go back to the loop.

1136
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,960
We've been under the ninety-seven summit.

1137
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
Thank you.

1138
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Well, papas.

1139
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Same way you repent?

1140
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,960
We are shortly going smooth.

1141
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Okay.

1142
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,960
So I'm going to turn.

1143
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
Is it okay to be able to shift?

1144
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
No.

1145
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Okay.

1146
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,960
Okay, we're really not so turning in now, if the ADNOT show, very, very important.

1147
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
Wow, it's not so bad, you know.

1148
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,960
Don't you have no background yet, you might, you don't need it now, you might need it this season, but...

1149
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,960
And the gear is still off, you know.

1150
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,960
Maybe you don't need any flaps at all.

1151
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,960
The gear goes down, the gear goes off, the gear goes off.

1152
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,960
The gear goes down, when you shell, if you can make it so that it's okay, lower the mouse, lower the gear.

1153
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,660
Nopckets, enc Apollo!

1154
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,560
Okay, we go forward. Now that's nowauto 5 seconds.

1155
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,260
Oh, haha, Ngyz?

1156
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Let's go! Let's go, because we have no incoming opportunity.

1157
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,960
This is still话 in!

1158
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
I know, I know. I do not know, it's not an Autcope sir, that's turning in quite far.

1159
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,960
Okay again, that sounds like this.

1160
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
Okay, there we got it.

1161
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
You see what I mean?

1162
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
There we have it.

1163
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
And keep this head in the wrong direction.

1164
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Okay.

1165
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
We have 18.

1166
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
Yeah, baby.

1167
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,960
Okay.

1168
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Here we go.

1169
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
We have a constant breaks.

1170
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Here up.

1171
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,960
Okay.

1172
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Here we go.

1173
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Here we go.

1174
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,960
Extend it.

1175
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Okay.

1176
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,960
Extend it.

1177
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Distend it.

1178
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Extend it.

1179
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
Yeah.

1180
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,960
That's it.

1181
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,960
Okay.

1182
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,960
This was number one.

1183
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
This was number four.

1184
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
We can't get up here.

1185
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,960
I don't even have that in prison at all.

1186
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,960
Oh, gosh.

1187
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,960
Okay.

1188
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Okay.

1189
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,960
I'm now in this section.

1190
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,960
If we start talking, we don't know.

1191
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,960
There's all two sons.

1192
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,960
I'm going to share them.

1193
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,960
You know what?

1194
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
We know that we have that form.

1195
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,960
We do just one form.

1196
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,960
We play the next week.

1197
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Is that okay?

1198
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
No problem.

1199
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
You can make it.

1200
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Then if you like.

1201
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
Okay.

1202
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,960
We get back to the next week.

1203
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
Okay.

1204
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,960
Now I appreciate these moments here.

1205
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,960
Dear flips.

1206
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Okay.

1207
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,960
Up and down.

1208
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,960
We try to spawn.

1209
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
You're blind.

1210
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
Now hold these servos.

1211
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
There's a lot of power.

1212
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,960
But then you're all set.

1213
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,960
You made it wrong.

1214
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,960
We're about it.

1215
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,960
No play.

1216
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,960
It might block some trouble.

1217
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,960
I'm not holding.

1218
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,960
It's the key to not eating.

1219
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,960
Think, think.

1220
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Okay.

1221
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
Okay.

1222
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,960
Okay.

1223
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,960
There.

1224
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,960
Up.

1225
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,960
They're lucky.

1226
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,960
I did you have such a good memory.

1227
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Yeah, really.

1228
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,960
Okay.

1229
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,960
Now flaps.

1230
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,960
Brakes.

1231
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,960
You know.

1232
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Carme needs.

1233
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
Up and down.

1234
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
Up and down.

1235
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,960
The time.

1236
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
You're done.

1237
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
Crush.

1238
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
