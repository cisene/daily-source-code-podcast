00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charlie 2-5-6

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
$16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is October 7, 2005.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Time once again for the Daily Source Code.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Late today, 225 p.m. coming to you from Gilford from Curry Cottage.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's right, it's the thank god it's Friday edition of the show.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And we've got a lot of stuff to talk about regarding my power book.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And it's replacement and what I'm doing.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In fact, it's put the sucker on ice.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll explain all that in today's show.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, because everything is changed significantly because I've basically had to resort to

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
buying a new Mac and installing all of my pertinent applications.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nothing is working properly.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm learning a whole bunch of things.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I guess there's only one thing we can do since we can't do a fully-formatted show.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Gmail Friday!

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah!

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right, Gmail Friday.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Since I didn't have any opportunity to line anything up all of my licenses and expired,

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
everything is expired.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have to be reinstalled.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not a very good day.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
For those of you listening to this on a serious radio,

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
a serious satellite radio channel 103 and you're thinking of what that.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That was this kind of talking about.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, welcome to the party.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We've been dealing with this crap for about two hundred and fifty-five episodes.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All right, let's get the Friday party started,

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
shall we?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ada from mashuptown.com, sent in something.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I actually think we've played on the show before,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if not, I definitely have heard this one.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But it is the kind of mashup that really gets you going on a Friday.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You know, you've got to combine the Scissor Sisters,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
sneakle back,

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000

Whoa, oh, that gets me in the mood.

123
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,600
I'm in a pretty good mood, actually.

124
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,520
I must say, because at the end of the day, my friends,

125
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,280
opening up a brand new computer,

126
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,200
I'm gonna tell you all about the story is,

127
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
it's like porn, you know?

128
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,960
It's like, it's just so wonderful to open the box

129
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,920
and smell that plastic and case equipment.

130
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,120
Mmm, I love it.

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,360
This morning, got up bright and early.

132
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
Christina was up at 6.30.

133
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,320
I don't know what she felt she needed more time

134
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,520
to do her hair and makeup.

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes, this is what 15-year-old are into.

136
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
Oh my goodness.

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,240
I've had seven o'clock after a relatively short night

138
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,120
and I didn't get to bed until about 230

139
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,680
almost quarter to three.

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,280
I spent most of the evening, well,

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,440
actually, it's been a lot of time

142
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,320
talking to Pod Show HQ and SF

143
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,200
because we have a couple of team meetings.

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,240
And we use all kinds of stuff.

145
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
We use Skype, we use telephones.

146
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,640
We use I-Shat.

147
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
That's pretty cool, actually, the I-Shat.

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,320
That works reasonably well.

149
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,280
And I also really spend a lot of time

150
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
with my pot or book.

151
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,280
You know the continuing saga by now

152
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,680
that I think the disk is basically what's fried.

153
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
It may not be the disk, actually.

154
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,680
I think the disk got so defragmented

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,880
that it can't really find its boot sectors

156
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,320
or whatever and so it's kind of hate or miss.

157
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,160
And last night, I finally got it up

158
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,400
and running a couple of times late in the evening.

159
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,600
And it would run okay, but if you did any finder actions,

160
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,120
opening your hard disk, it would slow down

161
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,440
and of course iTunes and there's something

162
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,280
with iTunes, I'm sure, would just pop up once in a while

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,000
just to start downloading Podcast

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and I try and force quitted as soon as possible

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,320
because once iTunes starts running,

166
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,920
then or any even a browser have to say,

167
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,080
the drive would start spinning and spinning and spinning

168
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,960
and then everything would get slower.

169
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,320
And so I was able to rescue a lot of data

170
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,200
that I knew I would want.

171
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,920
One is a couple of these OPML applications.

172
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,520
Unfortunately, I lost, well lost.

173
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,680
I'm the outliner is actually,

174
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,440
let me see if I lost I'm the outliner.

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
Because I got all the way to,

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
let me just check on the second if we go to,

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,280
and we go to applications,

178
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,240
we'll be able to save on the outliner.

179
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,440
Oh yes, oh save it, wonderful.

180
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,080
Okay, although I don't know if the license will work

181
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,440
or not, that's not a big deal.

182
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Okay, so I finally got it up and running.

183
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,120
Then I was able to shut down restart

184
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,920
and it would start up again,

185
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,800
but still really all these slow problems.

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,160
So I was pretty confident with start

187
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,280
and so I turned it off.

188
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,040
And that was, as I said, around two, 15, the morning.

189
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,840
And then I went to bed, got up, took our scene at a school,

190
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,200
and came back, let me see what was, yeah,

191
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,400
because the PC store doesn't open until nine.

192
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,840
So I came back and I tried to boot up the power book

193
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
and it wouldn't boot up.

194
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,000
And so I figured right, I'd already kind of planned in my calendar.

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,520
I was supposed to go to the eagle this morning

196
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,920
and meet with Rob Harris, who was the news director there

197
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,760
and the news guy.

198
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Chat and just to say, I don't, I think you wanted to interview me

199
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,520
about a couple of things.

200
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm not quite sure.

201
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,600
So I sent him a note at night saying, dude,

202
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm not gonna be able to make this

203
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,560
because I gotta go to the computer store.

204
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,320
And this was my plan.

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
My plan was to boot the power book up,

206
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,640
get a Mac Mini or something comparable,

207
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,680
and then boot the sick power book up in Firewire mode

208
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
and then basically transfer everything over.

209
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
I figured that I could probably get away with that.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,080
It would probably do the transfer.

211
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
It might take longer than normal,

212
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
but I thought I could get that done.

213
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,960
And so I said, I'd already dumped a bunch of stuff

214
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,680
onto my Firewire drive, not everything, unfortunately,

215
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,280
but the application's directory

216
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,640
and partial part of my preference is not all.

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,400
So I went to a PC world with this one in Guilford here

218
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,080
on that Woodbridge Road and really good, actually.

219
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,720
It's quite, they've changed the store

220
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
in the past couple months since I was last there.

221
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,120
And I like it, it's, yeah, it looks good.

222
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,280
And I got a small but complete Mac section.

223
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,800
They had a Mac Mini and then I saw a G5 iMac,

224
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,960
1.8 gigahertz, do you can't get it?

225
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,000
Anything bigger than I think, 500 megs of memory.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,440
It's got a hundred and...

227
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
It's like some humongous hard drive.

228
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,080
Let me just see what the hard drive says is.

229
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,840
I remember being quite large.

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,400
Yeah, it's a big one.

231
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,640
That's poor, man.

232
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,880
It's not that box.

233
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,160
Ah, light.

234
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,200
Let me see, what does it have?

235
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,520
160 gigabyte hard drive.

236
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,360
Yeah, nice, nice, nice.

237
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,320
So I thought, you know what, I'll just take that one

238
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,080
and I'll just keep that one in home.

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,160
And then, of course, the idea was,

240
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,120
was to get everything onto this iMac

241
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,320
and then do a complete, what is it?

242
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,240
Low level format of my hard drive on my power book

243
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,160
and completely clean that up, do a fresh install.

244
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,400
And then, my great, everything back over.

245
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
So I basically have a copy of what was originally

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,240
on my power book.

247
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,040
So that was the plan and I spent,

248
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,240
oh, a good two hours trying to reboot the power book.

249
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,400
It would not reboot, not from the drive at least.

250
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,560
It will from the CD and then the CD,

251
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,440
you get disc utilities and it doesn't see the drive.

252
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,000
So there's something very wrong there.

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,040
I've gone through all the FAQs

254
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,080
and there's been lots of great emails

255
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,760
and lots of helpful comments.

256
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,080
The only thing that really may work at this point,

257
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,240
and I know because I've had this before with the Mac

258
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
as you put it in the freezer for a little bit

259
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,960
and then it really gets cold and then sometimes it will boot up

260
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,000
if you're having boot troubles.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,240
So as we speak, it's in the freezer

262
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,560
and I'll deal with it later

263
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,240
because now all I want to is at least be able to access the drive

264
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,640
and just erase it and clean it

265
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,400
and if there's no physical errors,

266
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,760
then I'll be able to rebuild my book.

267
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,760
So I got the FireWard drive hooked it up to the IMac

268
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,120
and I was able to salvage the most important part

269
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,640
of my radio user land install,

270
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
which is how I'm still using show notes.

271
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
I'm going to change that by the way, boy,

272
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,600
did I learn something about proprietary protocols

273
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,880
and formats with that exercise, man?

274
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,680
Because you cannot update anything

275
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,560
on the radio user land servers without using radio user land

276
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,840
and it's a proprietary, it's probably published

277
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,840
but it's an upstreaming protocol that it's not like FTP.

278
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,240
So which is kind of lame, I guess.

279
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,680
Now that I always thought upstreaming was pretty cool

280
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
but it's not because you can't use any other tool

281
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,360
but radio user land to do anything with your file.

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,120
So because of course I could upload a text file

283
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,120
from my RSS feed, I could do a number of ways,

284
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,520
I could hand code it if I wanted to.

285
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,520
So unfortunately, that wasn't possible

286
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,320
but I was able to download a fresh copy of radio user land

287
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,320
futs around with a little bit as always.

288
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I luckily had the copy of my web blogs data base

289
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,200
so all of my postings for the past five years

290
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,360
were in there so I was able to say that I have backup

291
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,280
but this was really a most recent copy.

292
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,440
And my daily source code folder,

293
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,760
for those of you who use radio user land,

294
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,480
you know what I'm talking about.

295
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,120
So it took a little bit of fiddling around

296
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,160
to get that up and running

297
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,080
and it actually runs much better than it ever did

298
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,440
with this fresh, clean install.

299
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,680
I got my my OPML application

300
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,920
which has all the indie potter.org scripts

301
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,400
for updating the home page and then mega-seg.

302
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,680
This is the program that I use to schedule everything

303
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,560
that I'm gonna do in the show.

304
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,240
And the way mega-seg does their licensing,

305
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,680
you can download a demo copy.

306
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,120
And of course I also saved that application

307
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
but for some reason I guess you have to install it

308
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,200
from an installer.

309
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,040
If I recall properly when you purchased the app,

310
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,880
then they take you to a special download page

311
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,240
and that download page I think has an installer

312
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,520
and then you install it and there's no serial code

313
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,840
or anything to enter

314
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,680
because that app was basically just for you.

315
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,960
So reinstalling as I looked at their website

316
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,560
does require that you send them an email

317
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,960
with your purchase information,

318
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,440
your serial number or whatever you get.

319
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,520
And then they'll send you back a key.

320
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,080
But of course there are sleep right now.

321
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
They're probably, they may be California.

322
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,080
They must be in California.

323
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,920
So, excuse me, oh yes, you know what it is, right?

324
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
Don't have to say it, send sale.

325
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
So the limitation they put on the demo version,

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,960
which of course I could use

327
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,480
and I had to re-emport up there it goes.

328
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,200
Demo version, buy online for an instant download.

329
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,600
What it does is every 15 minutes it stops.

330
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,040
So I knew that that would never work.

331
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,920
I'd never be able to line everything up

332
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,720
and then kind of time around this 15 minute time out.

333
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,440
So we'll just have to wait until the new code comes back.

334
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,920
And basically I'm gonna rebuild,

335
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,040
well, I was able to, all my songs are on my firewire drive.

336
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
So I was able, and you know, all the imaging

337
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,880
and all the sweepers and the bumpers and the promos.

338
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
So I could re, I was able to re-emport that.

339
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Of course, none of the in and out points

340
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
that I set were saved.

341
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,320
So bottom line, I am rebuilding my digital life.

342
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,040
And I'm gonna do it on this IMAC G5,

343
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,720
which I thought was just a fantastic machine.

344
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Big fucking surprise coming, check this out.

345
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,440
I actually added a noise gate to it.

346
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,000
I want you to listen to the output of the,

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,880
because I just use the audio jack.

348
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,440
And now I'm gonna have to go, you know,

349
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,440
get a firewire, what do you call it, interface?

350
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,840
Because, oh man, that's gonna build up latency

351
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,800
probably to fuck, sorry about that.

352
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
I'm just going through all kinds of stuff

353
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,240
going through my mind here.

354
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm gonna turn off the noise gate,

355
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,080
let me see if I can do this.

356
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,440
So channel five, here we go.

357
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm gonna turn off, because I have a noise gate,

358
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,400
I want you to listen to the sound

359
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,960
that comes out of this audio out jack on this,

360
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,480
you know, not cheap machine,

361
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,160
which for everything I can see is pretty professional,

362
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,720
but now listen to this.

363
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,240
Hold on, we'll do that.

364
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,400
I really want you to hear this.

365
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,160
Oh, that's not it, I guess I have to bypass it.

366
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
All right, here we go, I'll bypass it,

367
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,640
hold on one second.

368
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
Off, there you go, listen to this.

369
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Now that's obviously just the left channel.

370
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,920
Let me do the same for the right channel.

371
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,240
And just listen to the garbage that's coming out

372
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,400
of this audio card.

373
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,000
And if I touch the plug in the back, listen to this.

374
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
You can actually hear it.

375
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,560
So that's what we call shit.

376
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,560
That's really, really, really poor quality stuff in there.

377
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,600
So that's a bummer, and so what I did is I put a noise gate

378
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,440
on both of those channels.

379
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,000
So basically when there's no signal coming out,

380
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,240
it cuts off the audio.

381
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,560
And since we weren't able to queue anything up,

382
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,120
it's gonna be Gmail Friday, which means we just started

383
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,920
the top of the Gmail box and work our way down

384
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,200
finding anything to play, basically.

385
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,200
So right off the bat, Peter says Adam Digital Station,

386
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,240
BBC Six music played a snippet from Cruise Box

387
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,440
on a podcast today around 9.45 a.m. UK time,

388
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,040
promoting podcasts from the BBC, interesting.

389
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
So it wasn't like in a documentary format.

390
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,040
They were promoting podcasts made by the BBC using Cruise Box.

391
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,520
And he says, I hope your pro organization is getting on

392
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,360
to that.

393
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah, well, you know what?

394
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,400
I think that we'll obviously let this one slide

395
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,880
because we're kind of experimenting

396
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,280
with what we can and can't do ourselves.

397
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,800
So, and it could also be deemed fair use.

398
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,680
So we're gonna let that slide, but when it comes to pro,

399
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,720
which if those you've been listening for the past two days,

400
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,920
is the forthcoming, pod safe music,

401
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
writes organization.

402
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,440
And boy, am I getting a lot of feedback?

403
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,640
Wow, I really, really appreciate everything

404
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,800
that everyone's sending in.

405
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,840
And I've got lawyers who are giving opinions

406
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,160
in financial people who are thinking of ways

407
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,320
that, you know, this whole thing can be set up

408
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
and how can we make it just much, much better

409
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,680
than what ASCAP or BMI are.

410
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,400
And again, they have all of these splits

411
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,880
and percentages and special bonuses, really because,

412
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
you know, their world is finite.

413
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
There can only be so many radio stations

414
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,600
that they can collect from, but with podcasting,

415
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
which of course has to be completely global,

416
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
you can, yeah, you can, it's infinite.

417
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,760
In finite, today we have 9,000 podcast,

418
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
a few years, maybe 90,000.

419
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,440
And today we have 10 million listeners,

420
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,360
so in a few years, exactly 100 million listeners.

421
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,920
Email here from, oh, this is from Raymond Port.

422
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,040
Raymond, oh, he says, today one year ago, check it out.

423
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,960
Oh, this is gonna be cool.

424
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,160
I don't know if I have to set it up

425
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,280
and say, I haven't heard this again, it's Gmail Friday.

426
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,000
Maybe Raymond will have explained that if not,

427
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,600
then I'll cut it off, let me just see,

428
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,280
I've opened it up here, it's contacting RaymondPort.nl.

429
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,240
And the call letter, it was, okay, so he didn't set it up.

430
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,480
One year ago today, I was driving home

431
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,080
from the Netherlands to the Curry Castle.

432
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,080
And so this was really in the beginning of podcasting

433
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
in the very early stages.

434
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,680
And I'm in the car in the Studio A8,

435
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,080
doing the podcast, recording it as I'm sitting in traffic.

436
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,080
And someone is honking next to my car.

437
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,960
And I'm gonna play this bit for you

438
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,000
since it is our one year anniversary Raymond,

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,360
it was of course Raymond, this is what happened.

440
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,960
One year ago today, when I was recording in Studio A8.

441
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
What's in the call letter, it was, oh yeah,

442
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,960
W-I-W-I-T-B, which, depending on what,

443
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,480
if you're on the day air shift or the night air shift,

444
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
the day shift meant we're in the basement,

445
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,360
which is where the studios were originally located.

446
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,520
On the night shift, of course, it's we're into bombheads.

447
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,360
That was my college radio days.

448
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,600
I still have my, you know, the varsity jacket

449
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,160
from the radio station, W-I-T-B, air personality

450
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,720
and curry involvement.

451
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,680
So, but it was cool and college radio was cool.

452
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,840
And he's podcasting.

453
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,680
Hey, someone, someone's holding up his iPod.

454
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,120
Hold on, hold on, you window.

455
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
Exit the net, don't you open the name.

456
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
Here, come here.

457
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,560
Come on.

458
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,400
Hey Jeff.

459
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,240
Hey, little boards.

460
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Raymond, boards.

461
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
Still no.

462
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,920
Okay, dude.

463
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,760
Yeah, right, dude, we checked out a guy just drove up next to me.

464
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,360
And he's honking his horn and he's holding his iPod off.

465
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,880
And he's saying, I'm listening to the podcast.

466
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Yeah, damn, and I said, I'm recording one right now.

467
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,920
So Raymond, buddy.

468
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,640
Oh, that's very cool.

469
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,960
See, this is what I mean.

470
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,120
This is what it's all about.

471
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,600
Oh, that gives me a boost of energy.

472
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,840
That's fucking great.

473
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,800
Okay, so this is what it's like.

474
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
It's college radio only.

475
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,040
We're clearly, we're mobile in more ways than one.

476
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,960
So, American Heartbreak, I really liked that.

477
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
All right, so that was one year ago today.

478
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,520
Well, happy anniversary Raymond.

479
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,760
It was certainly a pinnacle moment in those early days of podcasting.

480
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,320
That was the moment when I said myself, oh my God, something's going on here.

481
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,920
He was listening to the Daily Source Code, a previous edition, in the same traffic I was,

482
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,240
as I was recording the next day's show in that same traffic jam.

483
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Fantastic.

484
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Next email on Gmail Friday on the Daily Source Code from, oh, this is from Mark Hunter of

485
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,760
the Tarton Podcast and we had a little back and forth email just talking about stuff

486
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,240
and, you know, talking about good vibes and he said, hey, and if you've never heard the

487
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,600
Tarton podcast, then you have not heard Scottish music, my friends.

488
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,400
So he made a recommendation, Amplifico from Edinburgh.

489
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,960
They contacted him a couple of weeks ago and he just switched them on to the podcast

490
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,280
and he said, music network, they have four or five songs up now and, of course, they magically

491
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,360
a link to that will appear in the wiki show notes.

492
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,840
He says, I put a track up on my server.

493
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,400
I think it would be great on the Daily Source Code, if you want to play it, I'm putting

494
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,880
myself and the Tarton Podcasts 100% behind these guys.

495
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,720
They should be signed up.

496
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,880
The singer probably has the best voice I've heard in a long time.

497
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,280
Okay, so let's hit that.

498
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:09,280
The track is called 10p mix, Amplifico, pod save music on the Daily Source Code.

499
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:41,080
Over this, over this, should don't do it when you have got such a bright, such

500
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
a breath.

501
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,680
Taken's how to hit them with them, feel the sick, feel the sick, but it flies in my

502
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,480
gut life thing on and out, on and out, on and out, all things you'll just don't

503
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,480
break, it's not hard to believe it that she's got a new name out to you.

504
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:08,480
There in her sleep, why is this my head feels no wonder more she's trying to hold

505
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
the key.

506
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm ready.

507
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,160
I know you're letting yourself down, but even one opportunity like this won't come your

508
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,000
way, so you've got to do it through your mama handle, you lost your sense of

509
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,040
the face that I needed, the threatening lotting and insisted something.

510
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,640
Anyway, when it's both good I didn't know I thought it was you, wasn't lucky, like

511
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:46,680
just when Marco did a racing understood through your Mama ehh, look at my fellow

512
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,680
When you're squashed and let this in the spiders

513
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
The goodness you can nest up

514
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,680
How you now lay me down to rest like a town like a town

515
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
That's makes not much to go around

516
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,680
But when you do, when you do, stand for me how things are

517
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,680
For more, to believe it that she's calling the name

518
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Out to you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

519
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Is it my head to show what the mushrooms got to hold

520
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,680
The long rest, I'm going to bed in the sun

521
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm going to be one of the two empty lights

522
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,680
This one from the way, something from the truth

523
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Through your far-right hair, go through the sun

524
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Let's say, let me play that everything you're feeling

525
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,680
It's just a perfect sense anyway

526
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Like a joke, like a drug, never feel you've had enough had enough

527
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:05,680
And when I'm standing, it's covered down

528
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Yeah, because you take it over, you think you can

529
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Like a joke, like a drug, never feel you've had enough had enough

530
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Such a bright, such a breath, deep, but to hear from with it the way

531
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Though you're ready, no sound, I'm going to be the one

532
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Not the tune of the light, this one from the way

533
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,680
She got a joke, like a drug, never feel you've had enough had enough

534
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,680
And when I'm standing, it's covered down

535
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Yeah, because you're ready, no sound, I'm going to be one of the two

536
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Like a joke, like a drug, never feel you've had enough had enough had enough

537
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,680
And when I'm standing, it's covered down

538
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
It's just a nothing light, just taking hold

539
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,680
You're going to find yourself later I won't

540
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,680
You're going to find yourself later I won't

541
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,680
You're going to find yourself later I won't

542
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,680
You're going to find yourself now

543
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Yeah, alrighty, some Scottish music on the source code

544
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Oh, it was alright actually, I kind of thought it dug that

545
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:38,620
10p mix. It was the title of that. Let me just go back to the G-Mails here. By the way,

546
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,520
in the meantime, I checked out how radio user land was doing. It actually worked.

547
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:50,680
Everything's back up. I don't think I have to do is repost yesterday's source

548
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,400
coding yesterday's job cast and then we're back up to speed. And actually the app is

549
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:02,120
it's nice. It's really fast. And of course, all you got to compact databases and all

550
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,920
this stuff to really make a work. But it's working. It's working. I'm rebuilding my life.

551
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,960
It's good to reboot once in a while. You know, it makes you powerful.

552
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,920
Adam, this is James B from JamesB.com. I just wanted to send you some audio feedback to

553
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,200
tell you how podcasting is changing my life. I don't think I'm alone. I'm sure that podcasting

554
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,320
is changing a lot of lives and I have a feeling it's only going to grow. One way that podcasting

555
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,680
is changing my life is that it has reignited my love for music. Several years back, I became

556
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,400
disillusioned with new music. I figured that I was just getting too old and out of touch with

557
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,600
the younger generation. I find now that I relate to a lot of music that is being produced.

558
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,120
It's just a matter of finding it. I can't find it on the radio or on TV. But it's out there.

559
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,000
I found it and it's all because of the internet and podcasting. Let me give you an example.

560
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,520
I learned about accident hash from your podcast. From the accident hash podcast,

561
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,600
I listened to the first episode of the podcast music rewind, which featured the Tartan podcast.

562
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,640
I started to listen to the Tartan podcast and heard an episode about Finiston.

563
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,480
Then I went to thefiniston.com website in order their CD and I just received the CD today.

564
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,000
Wow, now here's a brother and sister band from the UK shipping a CD that they only pressed

565
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
a hundred of and they sent one to me here in Utah. How cool is that? What other medium could

566
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,840
have that kind of distribution? Podcasting is truly global radio and much more. Another way

567
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,680
that podcasting is changing my life is that it has given me a creative outlet that I've needed

568
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,920
for a long time. I'm producing a podcast named Navalcast. It's what I call an entertaining

569
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,640
introspective podcast. It's just for fun and I don't expect to ever have a big audience.

570
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,240
Granted, I'd like a few more listeners than I have now. In my podcast, I just tell the stories

571
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,400
that I've always ended up telling to my friends, play some music and have fun doing it.

572
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,320
I figured the very least my children and my children's children will know a little bit more about

573
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,320
me because of the MP3 files I've left behind. I just wanted to finish by telling you and all the

574
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,880
other great podcasts that are out there to keep up the good work. Sometimes when I'm feeling a little

575
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,680
down or tired or wondering if I can really produce a podcast that a few people will enjoy.

576
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,800
I listen to the daily source code or podcasts for one one or Jimmy Jad or Dave's lounge

577
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:30,040
or the many others I listen to and I feel energized again. It gives me the motivation to be creative

578
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,680
to figure out how to get a podcast out there in the first place and then to do the next one

579
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:42,360
and the next one. Well, that's all I have to say. Now for a shameless plug, you can find my podcast at

580
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,600
JamesB.com. Thanks Adam. Talk to you later. Yeah, fantastic. Well, you pointed something out there that's

581
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:56,200
really quite interesting and rather important to just a stance still out for just a second. That is,

582
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,240
you know, when you're listening to one show and then you hear about another show and you hear a

583
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,960
snippet from that show and you pop around, that is, well, first of all, that's a social networking

584
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,880
is what they call that in Silicon Valley. But it's also the hyperlink. It's the, you know, that's

585
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,640
what people talk about when they say, well, the podcasts should have a way to, you know, or in fact,

586
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,600
some detractors of podcasting say, you know, it's no good because you can't, there's no

587
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,200
permalinking because you can't link directly into a certain spot within a file. But that's not

588
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,760
really what this is about, you know, but you see how the networks are built up and how you go

589
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,240
from one to the other. So the next part that we have to solve, which, well, of course, pod shows,

590
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm going to do her damnedest. The next part we need to solve is, how do you share subscriptions?

591
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:54,200
Now, of course, we have the OPML format, that's being, sorry. Let me just, uh, quit out of mega

592
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,880
set here for a second. The OPML format is used to share a list of subscriptions, but really just

593
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:07,720
one subscription. You know, how cool would it be if, um, if I'm on an instant messenger with you

594
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,840
and I can say, dude, you've got to check out this podcast. I just click a button then you're subscribed

595
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,000
after you accept, obviously. Or, you know, I could, uh, could SMS or I could text the subscription

596
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,400
to someone and it would automatically, you know, whenever they sync up or however it would work,

597
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,440
it would, it would add that subscription or, you know, just all kinds of things like that. And of

598
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,080
course, as we move, uh, well, and actually iTunes has a kind of a version of that,

599
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,400
where, uh, with the enhanced podcast, but, uh, it'd be nice to have some, you know, mobile

600
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,360
concept as you're listening. You say, oh, yeah, I definitely want to subscribe to that,

601
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:51,320
then there should probably be a way to do it. Okay, moving along in, uh, the Gmail box, as you

602
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,640
can tell, I'm talking and reading at the same time. Uh, see if there's anything, uh, okay, lots of

603
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,200
feedback on their arbitrons, stuff that we've been talking about, some more biodiesel,

604
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,560
here we go. Uh, Adam says Chris, heard your call for promo is this week. Want to let you know that

605
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,080
I've submitted my promo to you five different times in the last six months. You never,

606
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,760
and never heard anything about it. I'm not bitter. Just was wondering if there were others

607
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,680
like me, it would submitted them. And for some other reason or another, you just never got to them.

608
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:33,160
Well, Chris, yeah, let me see, what's the current count? 11,796 unread emails. Yeah, well, you know,

609
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,960
it might be somewhere in the middle of that, you know, I sometimes I do just kind of miss stuff.

610
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, you know what happened there? Uh, didn't come, uh, no, it's not another drive that

611
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,480
are broken. It didn't come in fast enough. Oh, that kind of sucks. Hmm, what should we do about that?

612
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,800
That's basically, uh, well, is that, oh, that's probably his server. It's a little bit slow. Okay,

613
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,160
we'll just let that load. I'll play that in a second. Let me just see what else we got here.

614
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,880
That's going to open up iTunes. What the hell? Let's see what happens. Uh, it's an, uh, an M4A file.

615
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,680
Remember, this is Gmail Friday. Are your feedback for the daily source code 254 from October the 5th?

616
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,280
And I just want to say a big thank you for other things that you've done so far. The daily source

617
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:52,680
code, it's their pod finders and all the things on pod show, uh, the pod save music network and so on and so forth.

618
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:00,200
And, um, I think it's a really nice what has happened so far. The chances that we actually

619
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,680
don't have to listen to the conventional mainstream radio stations anymore has really benefited.

620
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:14,520
And, um, I think most of us 10 million listeners so far, I think you said, um, I really appreciate

621
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:22,520
things and don't feel like flaming you or people really working hard for the success of this thing

622
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:31,080
and basically for the good of all of us. So, um, as I said, a bit big thank you and don't

623
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:38,680
let this upcoming stress get too close to you and your guys at Pocho and I wish you all the best

624
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,840
for your ventures and things to come. So, uh, looking forward for more stuff to come and listening

625
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,360
to the daily source code to see what's coming up. So, take care. Bye. Thank you very much,

626
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,600
young, young Pacill, who that was. And that actually didn't open up an iTunes that

627
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,560
uh, opened up by default in Safari in a quick time plugin. Okay, let's play that promo again because

628
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,680
guys, give you this imagine, you know, poor guys sitting at home, I finally play this promo. It cuts

629
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,360
out and they don't play the whole thing.

630
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:39,080
The car cast with your host, Grins Cocker.

631
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:47,080
I wanna blame it on the night. I wanna blame it on the last good night. I wanna blame it on

632
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:55,800
the other thing when they're drying out for knowledge and money. Hi Adam, Chris Cocker in here,

633
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,680
wanted to let you know about my show, the car cast. So, what would happen if you took a guy

634
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,480
with way too much time on his hands and gave him the ability to record a podcast while driving

635
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,760
around Seattle? Well, not entirely, but that's the premise of the car cast. On the car cast,

636
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,960
we cover news news items tonight. A couple of things we want to talk about. First of all,

637
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,440
we're gonna do a fat band update. We're gonna talk about bouncing hills back in the news

638
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,080
against an item. Finally, uh, fill her up with wood. Do a little Samsung. Holy cow!

639
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,000
Look at that truck. Okay, Ren front of me is a four-explore, a big SUV, and uh, the tire,

640
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,480
the back left tire on it is literally ripping apart. It's got like hunks of tire hanging off of it.

641
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,720
These are the phone calls. Peter, how you doing?

642
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,200
Peter, you're right now on the car cast.

643
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,320
And all of that is done while driving around Seattle. If you'd like to check out the car cast,

644
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:06,200
we're listed in the iTunes music store, or you could just go to thecarcast.com. That's thecarcast.com.

645
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,560
Be listening, because I might be the one tailgating you.

646
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,720
You know, car manufacturers of the world pay attention. What's fantastic opportunities here

647
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,040
that you're just letting pass by? Not to mention that you should be giving me diesel vehicles.

648
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,120
It's not to be a new one. Give me the, give me like the executive one that's been driven for

649
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,840
3,000 miles, and the executive gives it back and gets a new car. Give me that one.

650
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,160
I'll podcast from it, and we'll be throwing vegetable oil and stuff like that in the tank.

651
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's see, uh, flight humor from, uh, who's this from? Who is this from?

652
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,480
It doesn't even say. Well, that sucks. Uh, our carver. Okay.

653
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,440
This is funny. This is like, uh, the wife fly through the valley of death. I shall fear no evil.

654
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:04,600
For I am at 80,000 feet in climbing. That's real pilot humor. Yeah, you've never been lost until

655
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,320
you've been lost at Mach 3. Test pilot said that. U.S. Marine Corp Gunner, U.S. Marine Corp Gunner,

656
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,560
he's sergeant says, you, you, you panic. The rest of you come with me. Okay. Yeah, that is definitely

657
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,200
flight humor. All right. Let me roll out another one of these feedback things. Oh, my goodness. That's

658
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:26,760
cool. Now I clicked on that M4A file and it brought up a whole page of code. That was really nice.

659
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,240
Okay. I'll just skip that one. You know, maybe we should, uh, uh, maybe we should look at

660
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,840
ending the show. Oh, I'm going to download this. This one last bit of feedback. Remember it is

661
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:45,240
Gmail Friday, which, of course, is the reason why it's, uh, it's all over the place. I want to go to

662
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,640
the pod safe music network and, uh, we'll get out of here with a song. That will be that'll be fun.

663
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,840
Hold on. Let's, uh, oh, it's M4A text. Oh, well, that's not going to work.

664
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,640
Oh, incompatible systems and file formats and everything. Okay. Let's see if this works.

665
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,520
Use M4A. And now I can just open that with quick time. I hope. Let's give it a try.

666
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:16,280
Hi, Adam. Um, here is stuff. MC in the place to be live, uh, from Antwerp and with the sheriff in the house.

667
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,080
And, uh, I have kind of a comment about two things you said. The first thing is about the, um,

668
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,400
the radios. Um, if radios are good in the country, podcast is working. Let's go.

669
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,360
Actually, I think it's pretty, um, exact. I have my view on the things is that I'm, um,

670
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:39,320
I'm originally a bad guy living in Germany. And, uh, when I'm in Belgium, I use to listen to a

671
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,200
really cool radio, which is, I think, my opinion, city of Warsaw. Also, on a French-speaking

672
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,320
Belgian, uh, we still have no, uh, corresponding to the coolness of city of Warsaw.

673
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,480
It's all for the country. And when I'm in Germany, I use to listen to Einstein's life.

674
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,680
These are two only radios for which I'm not turning on my iPod on when I'm doing the

675
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,840
radio. Normally, I use, I'm used to listen to the source code or whatever else.

676
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,440
Other podcasts in the radio. And I have a really cool thing in my auto radio, which is a check-in

677
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,160
to put directly the iPod in. But, uh, I still, I listen sometimes now and then to radio,

678
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,440
because like I said, these are the two only radios that I know that are not playing the normal

679
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:27,240
music and just doing the, you know, typical 70s, 80s, 90s, and the best of today. So, uh,

680
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,680
that's the only reason. The second thing I wanted to react is about beard, here's it.

681
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,080
Wait a minute, did you hear that? Did you hear that? They do the same damn thing over in Germany?

682
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,400
There's seven, the best of the 70s, 80s, 90s, and today, everybody, uh, interesting.

683
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:48,440
Crap crosses all borders. You speak a lot about beard, here's a lot of Volkswagen Golf,

684
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,440
which is a lot of beginning, but you can put also by a diesel in it. It's written in the manual.

685
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,520
So, I asked a few people around me because I'm a, I'm an ecologist. So, I ask and the conclusion

686
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,280
was that first of all, it's more expensive, most of the time, which is weird. And second of all,

687
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,760
you will consume more fuel. But the second, the third thing is I heard and speaking to the guys

688
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,720
directly at Volkswagen at the mechanics, they told me that it could actually not be so good to mix both.

689
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,680
So, if you started, and for years and years, use diesel, it's not a good idea to mix both.

690
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,760
So, either you start from beginning only with biodiesel, or you stay with diesel. So,

691
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,800
until now, I said with diesel, I hope it's going to change, and I hope that we can

692
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,840
make the things happening, like you say, like put all the crabs in your tank. It would be the best

693
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,680
thing, but I'm not going to do this. Dude, I want, there's like another three minutes on that.

694
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,840
I've got to listen to the rest of that, but I just want to, you know, get out of here with the song.

695
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,760
I just logged in the pod save music network. I'm just looking at all the new submissions.

696
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,960
And what I usually do is I look at the listener ratings and, you know, the genre, whatever I'm

697
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,400
into, what do I feel like, let's see, pop rock, let's see what this is. John McCloy, if it's,

698
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,120
if it vibes, then we'll leave it on. And, uh, sounds a bit like Mr. Mr.

699
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,520
This is called, uh, just believe it.

700
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,800
So far so good. How about the vote?

701
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,560
It should be, you're in a compass, knows what's best for you.

702
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,360
To find out where you're going, where you wake up, where you're to.

703
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,480
In these big surprise, when I let go of the who, the what, the where the when's and why,

704
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:11,480
surprises us there, let it go, and then all of them come together,

705
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:20,120
we're alone, let it be, just that you'll find it when you need it.

706
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:29,080
So believe, believe it, just believe, just believe it.

707
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:39,080
I lost my innocence and somehow ended here, for you, I'm dumped up, time and fire,

708
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:48,040
I'm still safe, it's just not in the mirror, still fine, time and fire.

709
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:55,800
If you hope, if you wish, do you live as if heaven somehow owes you,

710
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:04,760
that you help, that you reach, that you stretch, that you can't, and I'm not, and hell, we're all here.

711
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,480
Let it be, just that you'll find it when you need it.

712
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:22,440
So believe, believe it, just believe, just believe it.

713
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:32,200
If you go, and then all of them come together, let it be, just believe it, just believe it,

714
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:38,760
just believe it, just believe it, just believe it.

715
00:46:52,440 --> 00:47:22,440
So believe, believe it, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe

716
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:44,700
just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, sure, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe, just believe

717
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,700
Just believe it.

718
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,700
Cool.

719
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,700
John McCloy, just believe it.

720
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
We were lucky.

721
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,700
We just hit whatever came up on the podcast and music network.

722
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,700
Recent submissions.

723
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,700
And I was pretty damn good actually.

724
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,700
I had also had a kind of like a YouTube vibe in there.

725
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
Dig that.

726
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,700
Very, very cool.

727
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,700
John McCloy.

728
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,700
I never heard of him.

729
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,700
I guess he's new to the network.

730
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,700
Okay.

731
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,700
So that just about wraps it up for the daily source code for today.

732
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,420
And thank you all of you by the way who were inquired about Patricia and the medicine getting

733
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,700
to Paris on time and arrived this morning.

734
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,300
That was that was very enjoyable.

735
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,020
The whole experience of tracking the package online and seeing that it was delivered to the

736
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,300
hotel at 7.40 a.m.

737
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,300
I was cool.

738
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:36,020
And you know, thanks to my buddies and other guys who offered private planes and all kinds

739
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,700
of other alternative ways to get it there.

740
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,900
It all worked out very cool.

741
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,900
So maybe we'll do some more over the weekend.

742
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,700
Patricia comes back Sunday and otherwise I'll be talking to you Monday for sure on the

743
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,700
source code.

744
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,700
Take care now and bye bye.
