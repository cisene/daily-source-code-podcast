1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Delta's here at Charlie 211.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,800
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,400
radio is invented.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It was $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm warning the content of this podcast may be not fit for worker kids.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is July 19, 2005.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi everybody, how you doing?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It is the daily source code coming you from Curry Cottage.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a little bit chilly today.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just in the mid-low mid-20s.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That would be a stomach rate of course.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And I think I stayed up too late for the past two nights.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I got those, you know, because really tired chill.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Last night was particularly brutal.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll get into that.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're going to talk about three topics in today's source code.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I still have to get my piece of paper to find out what they were.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to talk about the pod finder podcast.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're going to talk about yesterday's daily source code and

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Accomi and bandwidth and stuff like that.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're going to talk about iPod at org.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I guess it's four topics.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And the war on pods.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The pod wars.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We'll come for the better name as we go along.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Your daily source code.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's your audio directory.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's my break during the day.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey, kids got to do something.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I got some promos.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're ready to roll out for you.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Exciting news, by the way.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
On Friday, this coming Friday for the very first time.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We will be playing the podcast at the top 10 on serious, serious satellite.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Which is cool.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because we're claiming a top 10.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And we'll get published.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hopefully we'll get it in some magazines.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We'll be a weekly feature.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe in the USA today.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So it's going to be even cooler to vote and be voted on.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Podcast dollar.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Podcast dollar.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Podcast.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's the rationale over the place?

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know what?

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's get things rolling right away with some happy music.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is a few choro.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mix this mash up.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When I saw it, I was like, those two songs are going to fit together.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And then, hey, when I heard I said, oh my goodness.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's freaking perfect.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I also got some great pod save music on the way from the pod save music now.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But first, now that we found music.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We started dancing.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let love for us.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We sing to our bro.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,000
As soon as we started to move.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We played while our bodies are swayed through the dance.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then I'll break those down for a moment.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I thought it was clear that the plan was clear for sure.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The feeling is between us.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But when the music changes, the plan was clear.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We started dancing.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let love for us.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We started dancing.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let love for us.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We started dancing.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000

Yeah, like in that, in Carver, No Ittle Fretz.

786
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,520
F as in FoxDrop, Romeo, Echo, Tango, She's in Sierra.

787
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
Oh, man.

788
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,800
What was I going to say?

789
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,560
I was just thinking about something really prolific. I'm sure.

790
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,560
I screwed.

791
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
What I was going to do, well, I don't remember.

792
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Let's listen to what Apocalypse D.S. does say.

793
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
Hey Adam, this is Brian from the Apocalypse D.S. O Podcast,

794
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,440
which is a couple of comments.

795
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
So, on your last show, you mentioned a podcast

796
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
or who was having a bit of trouble submitting his show to the iTunes directory,

797
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
because he didn't have access to a credit card.

798
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,760
It sounds like his problem kind of relates to the problem I had when iTunes 4.9 came out.

799
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,920
Because I live in Japan, and there's no iTunes music store for Japan.

800
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
So, from Japan, I can browse the US store.

801
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,680
I can browse actually any of the stores in the world.

802
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
And I can download podcasts, thank God.

803
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,640
But I can't buy music because it's illegal.

804
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
And I can't get an iTunes music store ID.

805
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,720
So, without that ID, I can't submit a podcast.

806
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,480
Now, since I bought my iMac in Japan, and since Steve Jobs comes over all the time for T,

807
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,840
Apple knows exactly where I live, and a message comes up.

808
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880
You want to try to register saying the music store is available in my country.

809
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
A listener mentioned the same problem.

810
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
This guy was from Korea.

811
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
Nothing. To Adam Christianson on the Maccast.

812
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,600
So, I emailed Adam. I said, hey, I'm having the same problem.

813
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
I agree with this guy in Korea. It is a problem.

814
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,440
And then Adam actually submitted my feed for me.

815
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,680
And two days later, I was up in the directory.

816
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,200
So, that was cool.

817
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,080
So, I guess my advice is, if you live in a country without iTunes music store access,

818
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,840
or if you can't get access to a credit card, send Adam Korean email.

819
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,240
No, no, you're crazy.

820
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,280
Adam, that's not work of course.

821
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
Oh, no.

822
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
Well, maybe you can just try to get a touch of the friend,

823
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,560
one of those countries who has access to the music store.

824
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,680
Please don't do that.

825
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Also, before you continue there, a pocket with style, a pocket lips dowel.

826
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,680
You know, I was talking to Madge Weinstein last night.

827
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,320
Yeah, we do talk once in a while.

828
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,440
And because I was up so late, and she pinged me, and you know,

829
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,240
this is typical Madge, you know, angry, angry, Jewish bloated lesbian stuff.

830
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,440
Like, you know, and complaining about the indie podcast, not being listed on iTunes anymore.

831
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,040
And this is a meme that is going around.

832
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,880
And it's interesting because you really have to consider the source of these stories.

833
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,560
These stories are coming from predominantly mainstream media publications.

834
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,920
And it just makes me, me, me, in a way, it makes me laugh,

835
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,360
but it also makes me angry when I, because, you know, I read all the podcast,

836
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,960
Ali, message boards, I'm on the podcast, or mailing list, and the group at Yahoo.

837
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
And there's so much complaining and bitching about this.

838
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,040
And you're seeing it all wrong.

839
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
Let me take drugs, for instance.

840
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,600
Drugs are illegal. It's bad, you know, but it's a, it's a 100, 100 billion dollar industry.

841
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,920
Everything from the growing to the sale to the jails that people are thrown into.

842
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,040
Now, not that I'm advocating that, but stuff that's illegal is always attractive.

843
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,600
Stuff that isn't supposed to be heard by you.

844
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,760
Stuff that is sanctioned, stuff that is not presented because, you know, it's, it's, it's that other stuff.

845
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
That's beautiful.

846
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,960
So we should be proud of the tag in the podcasters, just like independent music.

847
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,560
You know, this is for us. That's fine. Well, it doesn't matter what you call it.

848
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,200
As long as we're all calling it the same thing. So this indie podcast or thing is stuck.

849
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,560
And I think Apple for that, because at first I was a little negative about it because, hey,

850
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,920
it's our word, right? We created it, but then like, no, it doesn't matter.

851
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,360
As long as you call it something, then people will know what it is. Now,

852
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
this is why I've been working so hard, really, on two projects.

853
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,800
One is the podfinder podcast, which, and this, this episode that was released today,

854
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,120
is 57 minutes long. I think I was able to cram 16 different podcasts in there.

855
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,360
No, no, not from, from our own pod show podcast network.

856
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,080
In fact, I put Madge Weinstein in and what is it?

857
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,000
Michael Butler's rock and roll geek the indie cast, which is a completely non-commercial show.

858
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,120
And we just pulled out, you know, all the stuff that's, what I could basically,

859
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:26,240
saying every single day, four hours a day on a weekdays that is. That's 20 hours a week.

860
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,520
We play podcasts, promos, and podsafe music and also mash-ups, but predominantly the promos,

861
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,760
and every hour there's a featured podcast, which you play in its entirety on serious

862
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,880
sidelight radio. And the response is overwhelming. Now, they have, I think they only have, like,

863
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
a little under two million subscribers, but that's going to grow. You know, they're going to have

864
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,080
five million in, in a year or two. And when Howard Stern comes on at the end of the year,

865
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,040
lots of people are going to be signing up. And people are finding it because it's like, hey,

866
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,920
that's not good for you. That's, that's like that podcast, and what they say,

867
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,080
shit piss fuck, cock mother fucker, cock sucker. I warned you at the beginning of the show,

868
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,560
didn't I? So people are going to come looking for stuff like that. People are going to become looking

869
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,320
for, you know, for great music that is outside the norm. You know, don't, let's just,

870
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,600
the, the, where our own worst enemy at this point, you know, bitching and moaning and, you know,

871
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:28,240
so when someone types in indie podcast at a Google that come up to all these bitching and moaning posts,

872
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,400
you know, stop that. In fact, um, I think that I, I want to do something pretty radical here.

873
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,480
I'd like to change the name of iPodder.org to indiepotter.org. And I'm going to make a commitment to

874
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,480
you right now. Now, it's no secret that there's been all kinds of flakiness on the server going on.

875
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,400
And we have a couple people working really hard right now. We're going to put down a real investment

876
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,320
in money to have a team put on to indiepotter.org. I'm just going to call it that for now.

877
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,640
Haven't changed anything yet, but let's call it indiepotter.org because that's what, that's,

878
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,040
that's where we want people to go. Um, it's so cool that a nom dex Dave Wyner and I hooked up again,

879
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,160
because now he's putting me on the beta of, um, of his OPML editor. It's great software. It's still,

880
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,000
you know, it's, the capabilities of it are so vast, but it's a great editor for a distributed

881
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,440
directory. And we've seen first hand now, first hand. Yeah, we may not have the server shit

882
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
all taken care of because it's just, I mean, it's falling on its ass completely. It's, we're getting

883
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,360
that fixed ASAP. I promise you. Um, but we don't have a problem with the content, you know,

884
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,080
there's over 100 people who are maintaining individual nodes on this thing. Some of them are actually

885
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,400
writing up their OPML files by hand, which, you know, that's dedication right there. So we've

886
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,160
talked about this before, but now we're really going to put our money where our mouth is. I personally

887
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,800
am going to make sure that, uh, we have a team so that there's someone to go to if you're having

888
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,640
issues, um, with your node. We're going to make, uh, it faster. We're also going to make it prettier.

889
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
Give you some tools for node managers to maintain your page if you want, you know, that's really

890
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,400
easy. The infrastructure stays the same. And let's just, you know, let's promote the crap out of

891
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,040
indiepotter.org. Let's, let's show people if they're looking for the cool stuff, they could say,

892
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,000
what's that indie podcast? What do I find the indie podcast? So now I'm not going to break anything

893
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,200
that I put it or domain name. I wouldn't break that, but indiepotter.org, I think is the brand that,

894
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,160
uh, that I'd like to change this to. And, uh, I'm going to need your help, basically. So I'm going to

895
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,000
need your help in, uh, in working on nodes. Uh, I'm going to need your help in, um, in posting and pointing

896
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,960
to it. And, uh, we're going to keep it, uh, you know, a dot org site. Well, uh, there's just so, so much

897
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:53,680
incredible opportunity. There's just sitting there waiting for us. And, uh, don't sweat it, you know,

898
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,200
it's, uh, it's just press and press or just, you know, it's like a victory for them, you know.

899
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,360
First, it was the bloggers now. Let's try and kick the podcasters down. You know, it's like,

900
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,840
you're 15 minutes of fame or over. It's just not true. I mean, I'm seeing the numbers coming through,

901
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,800
not from my own podcast, but for other podcasts, we have tremendous, tremendous amount of

902
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,480
listeners. And remember, this is not because we all said, oh, I really want to create a show

903
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,120
where I really want to say something. No, it's because radio blows, because traditional radio has,

904
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,080
for the past 20 years has just turned into a completely packaged, formatted playlist of crap.

905
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,960
And they don't have the spectrum. They don't have, uh, the, the broadcast reached to do anything

906
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,280
near what we're doing. And they don't have the balls to do the stuff that we're doing quite honestly.

907
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,800
You know, when would you ever see a Q-patterr.org site, you know, done by mainstream media?

908
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,960
It's not going to happen. Remember, um, if it's crap on the radio, it's going to be crap in a podcast.

909
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,080
It is. It's bullshit in his bullshit out. So, um, people have, uh, have found podcasting

910
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,960
because there was something different going on, something remarkable going on here as Peter

911
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,040
Day would say. Um, and they've, they've come and they've subscribed and they're sticking with it.

912
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,520
So, let's pull together a little bit here and, you know, let's stop all the whining and

913
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,560
moaning and bitching about what somebody wrote somewhere on an online version of a newspaper or

914
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,360
whatever. It's just not worth it. You know, we want to show, we want to lead, we want to really

915
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,920
give our listeners a great experience because that's what they've been, been clamoring for.

916
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,240
Okay. Hey, Matt, thank you very much for, uh, for, uh, getting me on that tangent.

917
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,720
And, uh, let me get back to, uh, apocalypse dolls comment. I'm sorry about that.

918
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,480
Also, uh, a different point is, uh, I teach English here, uh, kind of like, uh, Robin Williams in, uh,

919
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,720
good morning Vietnam. And, uh, tonight I was talking to some of my students about, uh, the

920
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,760
terrorist attacks in London. Uh, so one of the students, uh, seemed surprised by how strong the

921
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,120
people in London have been. And, uh, later another student commented, you know, like, he said,

922
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,440
maybe that's just how the media is portraying it. Maybe the people aren't really strong there.

923
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,920
And I thought, you know, that's a good point, but, uh, I really thought about, uh, listening to

924
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,640
your show and, uh, that you've been talking about how strong and, uh, how resilient the people of

925
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,560
London have been. And, uh, and that, um, like, that's podcasting, man. That's, uh, let's get into

926
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,520
truth out and, uh, finding out the news, straight from the people who are there. And, uh, you know,

927
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,760
with, with all this talk recently from people who've been arguing that podcasting isn't really

928
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,600
a viable, uh, former media, uh, you know, it makes it kind of seem ridiculous now, like, uh, it's real.

929
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,040
That's how you can get the news. Uh, anyway, love the show. Keep it up. Thanks a lot, Adam. Take care, man.

Perfect path. That's right. Perfect path. That's the guy who made a star box. It's a great little

935
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,800

My TV is central.

950
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840

Controversial opinions of the disaffected minority.

959
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Liberals.

960
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Heavy control by Republicans here.

961
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Liberals are an endangered species in Warren County, OIO,

962
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,840
or upwards of 70% of the population brought into the Bush administration's lies.

963
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Anyway, WC basically means toilet.

964

Join your hosts.

965
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Uncle Dan, resident tech wizard, liberal, and all around weirdo.

966
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I know the double entendre, but if there's a triple entendre, you might want to explain that.

967
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,840
And Abu Snookham's left wing activist.

968
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,840
And a proud Muslim, making him even more retarded.

969
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,840
And a new can wasteland of the WC.

970
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,840
And the WC is all about a couple of misfits in the middle of Bush country here.

971
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Join them at www.radiowc.com as they try to fight their way through the lies and the

972
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
ever present bullshit of the new county revolution.

973
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,840
In fact, their show is so controversial.

974
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,840
It has attracted the attention of President Bush himself.

975
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Listen to this recent interview with a president about radioWC.

976
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,840
What is it you see the people behind radioWC as a threat to the country?

977
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:35,840
We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart.

978
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,840
But Mr. President, you must understand that they are exercising now right to free speech.

979
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Wouldn't you agree?

980
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,840
This were a dictator shipping the hack all out easier.

981
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Just so long as I'm addicted.

982
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Okay, but if you do the Uncle Dan and Abu Snookham's, what would you say to them?

983
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
We won't detain them.

984
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Mr. President, exactly how did you find out about radioWC?

985
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,840
On the internet.

986
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,840
And sir, what do you think when you listen to radioWC?

987
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,840
A quiet, unyielding anger?

988
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,840
What did you think to yourself the first time you ever listened to radioWC?

989
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
President, I'm sure report.

990
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Well, there you have it.

991
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,840
This is the podcast, the Bush administration.

992
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
This is not one to two years.

993
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,840

And your podcast software to feeds.

997

That feed burner.com slash radioWC.

998
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Before the new podcast, shut them down.

999
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

1000
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Now this may not be a podcast for you, but it's a hell of a, that's probably what?

1001
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,840
49% of Americans who might be interested in that podcast.

1002
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
This is good.

1003
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I feel good about this.

1004
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
IndiePotter.org.

1005
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Yeah, that's kind of working for me.

1006
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Hey, let's play some happy tune, shall we?

1007
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840

I think I'm the first to play it on a podcast.

1011
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
So I'll make sure to register that.

Coming in so loud and clear.

1014
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
I've once gone trying to steal my ear.

1015
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Stopping me suddenly in my tracks.

1016
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
And I appreciate the facts while I'm here.

1017
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
You say I'm a sound scientist.

1018
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
You can do a value with the evidence.

1019
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,840
On a close case.

1020
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Highly classified.

1021
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Come potential in a race against the clock.

1022
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Music.

1023
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
You look like you could use a break.

1024
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
You said as I lived in my head.

1025
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
And I'm a looking from a danger.

1026
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Now to show how long I was out for.

1027
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Looking for the girl thought I saw her on the show.

1028
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
We went and looked together.

1029
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Bell that had been mistaken.

1030
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Looking in the wrong direction.

1031
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
I can question tape because to the answer.

1032
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
I can't a chance.

1033
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Cause when I hit the walls.

1034
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
From the back.

1035
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Send me up on the ball.

1036
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm allowed to go with somewhere to go.

1037
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,840
I know I'd rather stay.

1038

1114
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,020
I'm drained, but I feel really good.

1115
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,760
I was a nice chat we had today.

1116
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,400
Thank you very much for tuning in.

1117
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
Tomorrow, no source code, because I'm traveling off to San Francisco.

1118
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,880
Now, I may do a source code, but it'll be much, much later.

1119
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,120
Nah, I'd probably wait for Thursday.

1120
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,800
That's about the best I can do.

1121
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,200
Off on Virgin to the Valley.

1122
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,800
I love it all, I love it all.

1123
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,120
So I'd love to hear from you.

1124
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,720
Adam at curie.com, you can send your voice feedback if you want some Gmail as slowly

1125
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
counting up.

1126
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,360
I got to think of somehow responsible for that.

1127
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:50,920
Slowly, the Infinity Plus 1 is growing, we're going from 2 to 3 gigabits, which I'm very happy

1128
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,080
about.

1129
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,440
