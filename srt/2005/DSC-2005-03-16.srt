1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Transmators, we don't need no stinking transmitters.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Did this is one DJ?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You don't want to f**k with honesty.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's embarrassing.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's humb day.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's Wednesday, everybody.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How you doing?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
March 16, 2005.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Welcome to the Daily Source Code coming to you

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
from a sun-bathed curry cottage.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Man, it's beautiful today.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I can see for miles and miles and miles.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Got the windows wide open here on the studio

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and we're ready for about 40 minutes of fun.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, oh, oh.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, yes.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Got some cool things to play for you today.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Gonna talk a little bit about radio.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Gonna talk about world calm.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We've got an extremely not safe for work cover version

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
of an excellent song.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And of course, we've got a hit test.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm recording a little bit on the early side.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't, I just couldn't wait any longer.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Michael Butler is not due to be up and about until,

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for about another hour and a half.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pre-tape that once he comes online.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We finally set a date for hit test number 21.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Maybe that was 22.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Anyway, it's the, it's the guitar metal intro's one.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, I've been following OpenPodcast.org,

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
which is kind of my, my radio station, if you will,

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
during the day, I have it hooked up

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so that whenever something new comes through on OpenPodcast.org

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
it just gets queued up in my,

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
my iTunes playlist.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And the stuff that comes through there is just,

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
just how rages as old conversations going on.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And something I came across, actually,

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
was sent to me an email as well.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me just pull up the outline here.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Of course, all of this is in the show notes for today's podcast.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, recording, perfect.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hey Adam, with your years of experience,

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you've got natural rhythm,

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
so I spent a couple hours in front of a ACID studio.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is that AC?

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, acid.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In front of acid studio, I guess,

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
this is two years of form of software.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
ACID studio, I'm sorry, being a dick.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Some of the clips that I chose weren't necessarily the most flattering,

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but I did it with love.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Remember the worst thing about being in radio was when the production manager sat me down

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to go over my air check each week.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He pointed out all of my stumbles and bumbles,

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
but I always thought those bumbles were part of my charm.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Exactly.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's what Patricia used to do to me all the time.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's when you stumble and bumble.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's when you become a human for a second,

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
for just a nanosecond.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So here it is, Scott Fletcher's Adam's groove mix

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
as broadcast slash podcast on openpodcast.org.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
On your power book, it's function,

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
or on your regular key, it's the control key.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
On your power book, it's function,

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
or I don't want to do it.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Shoot.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I just want you to know that.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He drives and we talk.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't want to do it.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Shoot.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is worth it.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm doing it.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Rain.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm almost out.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Shoot.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's up?

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's just an hour.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shoot.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm almost out.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Shoot.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm almost out of time.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Shoot.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I love having that.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I use that all the time.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm almost out.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shoot.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm almost out.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Shoot.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm almost out.

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm almost out.

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm almost out.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Shoot.

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm almost out.

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No.

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Shit.

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're the only way.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Shoot.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Form automated.

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Filin' forms.

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I get it.

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Shoot.

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to say how I do it.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I get it.

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll take you to the top of the page all the way.

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can take, the top of the page all the way.

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It can rotate, um.

113
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can rotate.

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now I just need to find out how I can actually, um.

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Can rotate.

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You get, you get my drift there.

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You get, you get my drift there.

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Um, let's see.

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ah!

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Of course.

121
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Remember Ribball Day?

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, probably has an MP3 player.

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's the...

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
on your power, this function, or on your regular kids,

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the control key, the control key, the control key,

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the control key, the control key, the control key.

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So anyway, and a more good news,

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
it's actually cheaper if you want to know what this is all about.

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You want to know this way to complicated and discuss.

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's take it some more about, to come over to our side.

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You got to listen to the whole thing.

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, I just...

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, I just...

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That is the answer.

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's just a great place to get stuff.

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's just a great place to get stuff.

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, this is an excellent way to do it.

138
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, this is an excellent way to do it.

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No, I just need...

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No, I just need...

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey, guess what?

142
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, I just...

143
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
reagis all the...

144
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
reagis all the...

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, I just...

146
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, I just absolutely...

147
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, I just...

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know, I just...

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It just wants you to know that.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Uh...

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
...

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
...

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
...

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
...

155
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
...

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
...

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
...

158
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
...

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
...

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
...

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
...

162
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Just like we were in a freaking movie with like...

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
...

164
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
...This is like a movie set.

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My life is like a movie set, which I installed myself, right?

166
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't think that's gonna work.

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Nothing works anymore.

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, god.

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is sad.

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Uh-huh.

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's very frustrating for him, I'm sure.

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, why doesn't he just use the iPod?

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The Adam's groove mix.

175
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's the ego filler for the day.

176
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
God love it.

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you very much.

178
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's...

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can find that an open podcast that it works.

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's number one, three, four, eight.

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Amazing.

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
One thousand, three hundred, four, eight podcast.

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Been pumped through that already.

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's pretty cool.

186
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Um, so again, about, about today's weather.

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's, uh, it's giving me a real, real drive towards flying today.

189
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let me tell you.

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Um, and, uh, next week, I'm actually gonna go on another, uh,

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think, uh, maybe I can convince the wind commander to fly me or let me fly over the...

192
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Uh, over the, uh, over the canal.

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Um, that would be the channel, I mean, uh, between the mainland and the UK.

194
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So maybe, uh, I'm gonna go to Antwerp on, see, maybe Tuesday,

195
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and then maybe fly back Wednesday or whatever.

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, I'm training really, really hard, uh, because somewhere in June,

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I will be doing my test for my PPL.

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it has to happen in the States, because I have, I'm doing an FAA certification.

199
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, uh, looking forward to that.

200
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And then maybe, maybe we'll actually do that podcast from the air.

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's just that we're training so hard.

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's no time to concentrate on talking to you guys.

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You basically just have to sit there and listen to, uh,

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to William take me through all the motions, berating me.

205
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And it's kind of funny, though, the way he, the way he teaches is he's really, uh,

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
he's like, uh, he's like, uh, when he's burning, guys.

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Come on, man.

208
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've gotta push the metal to metal is what we need.

209
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So maybe we'll do that next week.

210
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Doug Ritter sent me an email.

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He says, um, Adam, let's step into the time machine.

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And pretend Christina was actually born Christopher,

213
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
which is interesting because that was the name we would have chosen

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
if Christina had been a boy.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Would you let Chris, do you want to know why, by the way?

216
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Uh, the reason why is because, uh,

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Christina was conceived at Christmas time.

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And we, we know this for a fact due to careful,

219
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
um, archival work of my wife.

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He could calculate it precisely back to Christmas.

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And it was a loving moment underneath the dinner table.

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It was just the do of us that didn't matter.

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Anyway, so let's step into that time machine.

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Present, pretend Christina was actually born Christopher.

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Would you let Christopher stay at Michael Jackson's house with all the, uh,

226
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
all the, actually he, he opened it up by saying, um,

227
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you know, this is, uh, you know,

228
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
so this is the real question that you should be asking yourself.

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I replied to him, Doug and Philadelphia said,

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you fucking crazy.

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know, I wouldn't let my wife stay at Michael Jackson's house.

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't let my daughter stay, you know,

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
even at her friend's house, it takes me, you know,

234
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to meet the parents.

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I want to know what's going on.

236
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I want to know where they're going to be sleeping.

237
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know, of course not.

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, that's just a stupid of these parents to, you know,

239
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to, or cunning as you will, um,

240
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you know, just, there's your answer.

241
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No, of course not.

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's no reason to.

243
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Absolutely no reason.

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But that still doesn't mean that Michael Jackson is guilty

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
just because he's fucking wacky or he's perceived as wacky

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
because when I met him, he wasn't that wacky.

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, no more wacky than anyone else in show business.

248
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Um, but, you know, innocent until proven guilty.

249
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And that goes for court gestures as well,

250
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
at least last time I checked the law I did.

251
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I've been getting some, um,

252
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
comments about, uh, this blip at the beginning of each show,

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
which, of course, I'm hearing it as well.

254
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You'll know that, um, I've moved over to using the iRiver iFP799

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
as my mastering device.

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So essentially everything that happens here in the studio at the cottage,

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
uh, winds up going through a little cable into the iRiver

258
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and I actually stick my headphones into the iRiver.

259
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So I can hear what's really being recorded.

260
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can hear the levels and everything.

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I think that that's getting much better.

262
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Um, but for some reason, when I turn on the recording,

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and this doesn't happen.

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I played back on the iRiver, but only when it converts to an MP3,

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
you hear this little, this irritating, like, digital burp at the beginning.

266
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I think there's a way to set up the iRiver,

267
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
so that it won't start recording until it receives a signal.

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Um, but of course, I don't have the manual anymore.

269
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You know, that got tossed out with the box.

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Um, and I can't quite figure out how to do that anymore.

271
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it's a certain key or button combination.

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So if you know how to do that, let me know.

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And I'll try that and see if that makes a difference.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because it is totally annoying.

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The only way to fix it would be to, uh,

276
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
essentially, uh, export the MP3 and recompress it again after it's already recorded and cut off that one bit.

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, I'm not really looking forward to that.

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I think that, you know, once we go from the iRiver format to MP3 from MP3 to AIFF from AIFF to MP3,

279
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
God knows what's going to be left over.

280
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And so another irritating thing is this buzz that I found in my microphone.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Lots of email came in, it came in about that.

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I don't want to demonstrate this again.

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You can't hear the buzz now.

284
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm trying to mic us loud as possible.

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now when I turn the microphone a little bit towards the ceiling,

286
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
you'll hear the buzz come in.

287
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll listen to this.

288
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There it is.

289
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And I discovered, uh, today.

290
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I'm turning it back down.

291
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm discovered today that I have the same with microphone two here in the studio.

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going to open that one up.

293
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, actually it's not buzzing at all right now.

294
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's see. Oh yeah, it's not buzzing now,

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
but when I turn it towards the window,

296
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
let me turn down mic one.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, so that's mic two.

298
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Listen, as I turn it towards the window.

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There it is again.

300
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So it actually stayed on.

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It actually stayed at the same, uh,

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
yeah, it was horizontal.

303
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But as I move it towards the window, it starts the buzz.

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Now I got all kinds of email and I really appreciate it.

305
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Uh, email saying, you know, do you have fluorescent light in your office?

306
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Uh, no.

307
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't have fluorescent light.

308
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you have dimmers?

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, I've got a million fucking dimmers throughout the entire goddamn house.

310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Uh, and by the way, I agree with the philosophy that Patricia has.

311
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Women over 15 need dim lighting.

312
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And quite honestly, guys over 40 can benefit from that as well in multiple ways.

313
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So yeah, there's lots of dimmers.

314
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Um, every, I've tried it with everything off, everything on full blast.

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I've turned the whole house off.

316
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Um, one thing that came in that I thought was pretty plausible was that it was probably coming from my monitor.

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And I have, um, one of those apple, uh, cinema displays are my desktop.

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The mics are pretty close to it.

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Although the mic, this mic two hours just, uh, demonstrating to you.

320
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm actually moving it away from that monitor when it picks up.

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So I really don't know what it is until, until I received this.

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This is a message for the light form known as Adam Curry.

323
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This is Jill L from the planet VW7.

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The button sounds you have been getting in your equipment recently are actually secret messages from space.

325
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Didn't you notice they get louder when you point your microphone through the stars?

326
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Actually, it's becoming very frustrating.

327
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Every time you get new equipment, we have to recalibate hours.

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And you seem to buy new equipment every week.

329
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Stop it.

330
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's becoming very tedious.

331
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Anyhow, what we've been trying to tell you is to go to www.nogagruplex.com

332
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and listen to the bugcast.

333
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
After all, Volkswagen New Beetles are actually spacecraft for our invasion, uh, our tourist industry.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So the next time you see a Volkswagen Beetle on the road, smile and wave.

335
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Or we will destroy you.

336
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Once again, listen to the NoGagruplex.com bugcast.

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is Joe L signing off.

338
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Alright, hold on.

339
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was waiting for you guys.

340
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let me see if I can do this.

341
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Uh, let me just get the preset there.

342
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hello?

343
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let me see if I can get this to work.

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, man.

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I had it all set up.

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
How can we done the work now?

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait, maybe I have to go up to three.

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hello?

349
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, that's not it.

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hold on.

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, dude.

352
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I was so ready for this too.

353
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay.

354
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's try it.

355
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's see if we can turn it off.

356
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hello?

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello, bloodcast.

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Hello?

359
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Congrats from reinforced with Victor Dean.

360
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is YOUR leader talking.

361
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You will follow our directions, I'll give you with us.

362
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Arne Dolane is gorgeous.

363
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Alright.

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now of course it won't switch that.

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Oh hold on let me see I can set everything back to the way it was okay how's that now I'll just buy

366
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,340
pastel deal with that later okay I always fund the play with the new equipment I love

367
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:56,580
teasing you guys with it. I'll talk about radio for a second. I've been a radio guy since I

368
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,740
was really well it really since I was like six years old my parents gave me my first

369
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,020
Sony transistor radio was an FM radio. Wait was it FM? I think it was just AM actually. It

370
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,580
wasn't AM little square transistor radio and I used to put it under my pillow and listen

371
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,260
to like basketball games and that was the thing I could really receive the most and what

372
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,140
I remember most from my youth as listening to basketball games under the with the radio under

373
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,860
my pillow and then waking up with the blasting you know with the full blast of my parents

374
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,460
basically fumbling to try and turn it off. And when I was 14 I started building my own transmitters

375
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:39,860
from based on the radio shack 100 projects in one box and I would have my mom drive around

376
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,180
the block to see how far it would go. Before you knew what I had an antenna and before you

377
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,580
knew that I had built a little mixer and I was mixing records and you know people around

378
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,220
the block were basically able to listen to a show that I did which was totally legal but

379
00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:00,460
it was pretty harmless. But that's really what radio is about. It's about communities

380
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,860
and when I was 15 I went to work it was not an unpaid job as a volunteer gig for radio

381
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,860
tulipa which was located in the tulip hospital in Omsalphane about 15 miles from where

382
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,060
I lived and several times a week I'd go there after hours and you know I would do well

383
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:25,860
I started off as an engineer only and then later went on to to do some hosting stuff.

384
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,180
And we'd literally go walk through all the wards and all the private rooms and we get

385
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,500
everyone you know to fill out request forms and we see you want to come down and watch

386
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,620
a show and we had a big auditorium next to the studio and we wheeled the beds down and

387
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,060
we tried to make a party for these people and that was also in in a way it's community and

388
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,340
then I started working for pirate radio in Amsterdam at Dacey Bell, decibel radio which was

389
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,380
we were on 72 hours per week in the weekend only and it was the rhythm of the capital

390
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,620
of the Netherlands. Of course we consider Amsterdam to be the capital not with the government

391
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:05,060
it's but it's the capital and it was extremely extremely popular in the early 80s again

392
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,940
and not so much about the reach you know we could only really hit Amsterdam but we had Amsterdam

393
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,740
it was our fricking town you know when I was in the hospital I had those patients it was our audience

394
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,820
so that's very much what what web logs felt like when they first came around feedback loops

395
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:26,980
another great thing about radio is you have instantaneous feedback through telephones that's what

396
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,580
most radio stations based on used to be you know mail in a postcard or letter or whatever now

397
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,420
of course we've got email and really direct feedback loops but it's really about you know the

398
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,980
connection between the person running the board if you will who's on the air at that moment

399
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,740
who's running the show whatever type of show it is and that audience that's out there I think

400
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,500
what what started I also of course is based on cheap distribution radio distribution is relatively

401
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,220
simple you know unless you're trying to reach the entire country and you need a huge network of

402
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,620
stations you know essentially you can get a station going just like it sounds kind of shitty

403
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,940
within the while I set the mic actually I had my settings here hold on

404
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,020
hope you're on my me doing this on your time let me just make sure I had

405
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,340
all my settings right so those two were like that that was a little bit lower this was set

406
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,100
comfort well oh that sounds nice all of a sudden and it that's a little bit on the loud side

407
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,860
so maybe a little bit less there this was set up there we go that was also set up so I can open

408
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:47,780
that a little more sorry about all this that was set to there that was set up like there and that

409
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:54,820
was like there two two let's just see if we have a little bit of echo okay perfect oh there we go

410
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:02,820
and I'd saved it so carefully in memory and I was supposed to let me just just save that now into

411
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,460
memory I'd done it so perfectly I thought right okay sorry so we'll get back to the radio stuff here

412
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:17,380
um cheap distribution that's what I was talking about totally you know every college in America

413
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:24,020
I can basically have a 10 watt you know sun up the sun down FM transmitter that basically will

414
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:31,460
broadcast to the the community that being the school and whatever community is you know surrounds

415
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,900
the school which of course I'm trying to tighten up my mic stand here involves local commerce

416
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:43,300
that probably caters to the community which would be the students decentralized you know that's

417
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,460
kind of the kind of we've seen the opposite of that take place in radio in the last couple of years

418
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,580
but if you ever been to a radio station I'm not talking about a major market in New York

419
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:59,620
or Los Angeles or you know a big P1 market radio station P1 by the way stands for priority one

420
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,020
so that means it's one of the stations people will hit first when they get into the car and hit

421
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,220
the preset buttons then you've probably seen that it's usually you know an office

422
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,220
an office suite with the cubby when that cubby holes with the so we're not looking for cubicles

423
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:22,340
and there's a station manager a sales manager who is probably also the

424
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,660
promotions manager at the same time then you might have a music

425
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,220
director it's probably the program director I mean it's only three or four people that can really run a

426
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,220
station like this because it's just not a lot of money in it and and if you've ever seen these

427
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:44,260
studios it looks like shit you know they're uh they're beat up uh overused uh studios that are

428
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,660
just you know that just don't cost a lot of money to really put together because radio once you've

429
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,900
got your basics you know it's the more listeners you get the more money you're gonna make that's

430
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,300
all then it's just into comes down to promotions which of course a bit coming incredible art in

431
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,780
promoting it now here's what I think what happened with radio where it started to go wrong

432
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,540
I believe that just as with television by the way certainly in the United States

433
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:16,660
advertisers started to figure out intuitively that the numbers don't add up the numbers that radio station

434
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:23,460
say they have in listeners and boy they're graded something they call extrapolation they can extrapolate

435
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:32,260
numbers in radio just to an uncanny level with you know educated men who listen for three seconds per

436
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,180
day you know you get credit in the ratings if someone remembers your disjockeys name or the name of the

437
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,700
show and it's just all these these little blue poles and things that basically help you get some numbers

438
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,740
on paper but doesn't really add up to what the advertisers were seeing in return on investment

439
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,940
of money spent and this is just based upon my experience in in the business and what I've seen

440
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,820
and what I think so it's not necessarily fact but I really have a strong belief that this is what

441
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,580
happened so we had to get more return on the investment for the advertisers and what works in that

442
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,900
case is repetition that's what a lot of marketing is repetition repetition repetition you're going to

443
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:19,060
remember the jingle or the slogan or the sign or whatever logo it is that is repeated in as

444
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,500
many places as possible now of course that's not very cost effective that is only for the big boys

445
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,620
for the big brands who really need a shotgun approach or use a shotgun approach and can

446
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,220
basically get away with it so I think that what we're seeing what we saw first with web logs

447
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,780
is a complete understanding of what this could be by radio people I saw web logs in a

448
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,180
quite a minute this is the broadcasting I was always thinking about on the internet only we can't

449
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:54,420
do it with audio and video yet we're going to do it this way and you can still get an incredible

450
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:02,660
reach in fact if you go back a couple of years when the very first aggregator came out in radio

451
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,900
userland I actually bought a position in that aggregator so that I would be in the default

452
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,420
install because I knew that if I could just get in and I would be default somewhere that people

453
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,860
basically would just leave it there and hopefully I could you know create enough compelling

454
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,940
content that that it would be interesting and people would not unsubscribe or at least they wouldn't

455
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,940
find it irritating to get rid of the subscription but I knew that we had this broadcast mechanism

456
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:35,700
for small communities but instead of it being communities of geography we are going we started

457
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,860
with web logs looking at communities of interest and interest being a number of things you know

458
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,100
could be just the interesting yourself yeah I'm interested myself I write about myself

459
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,500
people who want to know about me you can find out about me what we saw a lot of people

460
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,060
become experts on particular topics start web logs about those topics and actually become

461
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,300
quite successful because once Google recognizes you through page ranking that you're an expert on

462
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:07,300
a particular topic you're going to get all the search results to your web log and you know that's

463
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,740
why we're looking at gadget you know those guys are doing exactly exactly that and their community

464
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,940
is going to be quite large because gadgets is a large community so now that we have podcasting

465
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,740
I believe that we're at least if we want to look at the aspect of who you're addressing it's the

466
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:34,020
same thing it's exactly the same thing as radio um you're talking to a community of interest

467
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,100
it doesn't have to be very large you have your direct feedback loop you have your distribution

468
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,460
mechanism and if you so choose then you can also run commerce through that in exactly the same way

469
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,460
that it's being done with radio songs live happy to show I'm on say

470
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,420
man it's not noisy outside the studio today so without all the repetition I don't think it's

471
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,820
necessary because you've you've got your pretty qualified audience subscribe to the show you know

472
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,140
so they're going to be waiting to to hear about products and services that will make sense to them

473
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,140
so you know you you want to try and pick and choose what what you're going to be advertising

474
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,060
of course arguably your entire audience may want to cook or Pepsi so that's that's something to

475
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:21,620
consider um man it is kind of noisy it's like all kinds of air traffic today

476
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:30,100
damn all right so back to the podcast see it as everyone having a transmitter even though we

477
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,340
don't even know stank and transmitters not everybody has to make money not everybody wants to make

478
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,380
money and guess what very very few people if anybody will make the kind of money that we've seen

479
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:48,100
in the previous broadcast distribution world I mean once you can lock something out or it's

480
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:54,420
like someone out or you know make the distribution only available to those who have frequencies etc

481
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,500
and transmitters then you can charge much more so we're on a on a very level playing field all

482
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:07,220
of a sudden where it's going to come down to quality and how business like you are if you want to

483
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,180
make a business out of this and there's nothing stopping anybody but there's also nothing forcing

484
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,980
anybody into doing that so anyway so um I got to say and that props to Dave on this one when he

485
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,700
came out with radio user land which was one of the I think the first first desktop web blog tool

486
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,620
content management system um immediately I said what this makes so much sense and I don't think

487
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,860
anybody got it I think as it's probably around the Napster time as well people are thinking about so

488
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,780
what are you going to do trade songs and stuff like that and you know I don't think anyone was really

489
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,940
understanding what he meant at the time but it really is with its publishing subscribe mechanism it

490
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,900
really is a radio you know it's it's exactly what we're talking about here um now if we can only

491
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,020
just bake some of this stuff into uh into the iPods or MP3 players and when we've been through that

492
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:06,980
many times it will be beautiful so anyway that's my bit about radio for today we call it radio

493
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,740
we call it podcasting whatever you want to call it it's about communities bigger small and depending on

494
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,620
your type of community that will depend on where you can go with it so I kind of a

495
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:24,740
little bit of good news well not really good news but Bernie Ebers is it Bernie Ebers who is the

496
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:35,700
CEO of WorldCom who was apparently at least partly responsible for the collapse of WorldCom

497
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:45,780
and subsequently one of the largest bankruptcy filings in US corporate history I guess he was

498
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,500
convicted of fraud 11 billion dollars worth of it and I have to say that one of my companies

499
00:27:54,580 --> 00:28:02,580
the data barn was also affected by non-payments from WorldCom so enjoy your stay in jail Mr Ebers

500

513
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,060
two new iPod or categories uh putting today and there's a lot more in the queue and also

514
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:26,260
if you've submitted for any of the categories we're running about four to five days behind right now

515
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,820
some of the categories are are almost immediate but this thing is just growing exponentially which

516
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,100
of course is the way it's set up to grow we have a transportation node now and we have an automotive

517
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:43,860
node so be sure to check those out on ipodder.org and great news about Lars Ulrich from Metallica

518
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,340
he is actually working on bringing Metallica which is the great mashups between the beetles and

519
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,900
Metallica I should have not even a mashup it's a it's a group playing nice voice mail actually

520
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,380
let me bring up the story here I have a link to it in my uh in my notes home on

521
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,060
I'll bring up the web page and I can actually read bits of it to you because this is uh this was

522
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:11,620
pretty messed up we actually played some Metallica on on the source code a while back oh man what is this

523
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:20,180
why is it opening up safari hold on a second I wanted to open up oh man this is not going the way

524
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:31,380
I wanted to hold on so it's these beetle songs which have been modified in Lyric and obviously

525
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,100
in musical content to sound more like Metallica was doing them hold on let me I've got the

526
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:44,820
I've got the URL now is he pasted in here we go I was on Boeing Boeing Boeing Boeing dot net here we go

527
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,780
Mr. Lyric Ulrich no stranger to matters of intellectual property law on the internet

528
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,100
we'll get to that piece in a second here we go

529
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,260
Okay as reportedly as reported previously on Boeing Sony music accused

530
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,780
Metallica of violating copyright laws demanded their webmaster pay unspecified damages

531
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,780
and force the bands eyes p to shut down the website but now Lars has volunteered to provide assistance

532
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:16,500
with legal negotiations for Metallica and asked Metallica's long-time attorney p

533
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:22,580
paterno to try and diffuse the situation with Sony on behalf of the dudes from Milwaukee so Sony is now

534
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,540
agreed to drop the case which is interesting that Lars is helping out five years ago the story goes on

535
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:32,420
he stood on the steps of Napster hauling boxes full of 300,000 names all people who said we're

536
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,580
using Napster to steal Metallica tunes but things have changed that debate was about who

537
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,380
profited from Metallica's music he says this one and check this out is about creative rights

538
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,420
at the heart of rock and roll itself. Lars says he believes that cover bands, mashups and the

539
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:53,220
right to reinterpret art on the internet are things worth fighting for. I'm right I like that you know

540
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,740
where's I with a little down on Lars in the boys this is very very cool so it looks like

541
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,300
I don't know if we're actually going to be able to play Metallica songs anymore but I certainly

542
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,740
would love to.

543
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:16,020
I got a lot of with y'all, Poles. Okay come on in y'all. Hi Adam I've got another hit there's three of

544
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,580
excellent. I don't think it's too difficult so let's go right away this is number one

545
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:30,180
hammer. One more time. Oh yeah on this like some horrible stock aching and waterman thing is

546
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:38,100
I like regassely or something that's and number two is a bit shorter. Once again.

547
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,620
I recognize that piano riff anywhere Chicago stay the night. Ooh within time even.

548
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:57,460
And this is number three. What's that? That sounds like cool in the gang. The bad drum drum roll

549
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,900
the beginning of every cool in the gang. All right y'all hit me with the answer.

550
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:07,460
What the answer? Answer number one in today's hit test. It's an oldie and it brings back memories

551
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,620
even for me this is Alicia and baby talk. I told you some bad stock aching and waterman life for

552
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,620
no

553
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:43,460
answer number two. All right this is Chicago state and I knew I'd get that one really.

554
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,540
Bung I don't want you necessarily

555
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:24,060
She got it and I can't remember if this is the video clip where there's a car going through

556
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
the board.

557
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
That's it.

558
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
I can't remember.

559
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
This is great song.

560
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
That one I would certainly.

561
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
And to number three.

562
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Cool.

563
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
That's cool.

564
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Straight ahead.

565
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,060
I didn't even know the title.

566
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:43,300
They all start out that way.

567
00:35:43,300 --> 00:36:01,620
And so number three, cool and the gang and straight ahead.

568
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,860
Well I hope you did well Adam.

569
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:10,620
I'll try to keep looking for tricks to use in the hit this.

570
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
