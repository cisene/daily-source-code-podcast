00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This name is Edon Curry.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He's old way in a very moving wheel.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right up, right through out the streets of Missouri.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
His name is Edon Curry.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And though his vision's blurry.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He goes up dog that's very empty free.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then say oh for his name is Edon Curry.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000

Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey everybody how you doing it is Thursday the 16th of June.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And you know what that means?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's New Music Tuesday of course.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
New Music can mash up and pot safe Tuesday on the Thursday.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh man I apologize for yesterday.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was working on a humongous audio project.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I hadn't done one of these in all in years I think.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know I had the big multi track recording software out.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was pretty intense.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I wasn't done with that until about a quarter to one AM of course.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
By that I didn't feel like putting a source code together anymore.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I started with relatively early.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I apologize.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Of course I gave everybody a chance to catch up.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Most people are a couple days behind on the source code.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's funny because I did the the Michael Jackson post Michael Jackson trial.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Post the verdict podcast.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And now you put a podcast like out there.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It just takes almost like 48 hours for people to hear it and start responding.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And the response once it started coming was.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wow it was pretty much overwhelming.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mainly in a positive sense but there are lots of good points there from other sides of the equation.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I'm going to put that behind us now if you don't mind.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's move on to exciting things like pot safe music.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Got plenty of it lined up this hour.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Got some good promos.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's see.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I have a couple.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Actually two mashups.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
One which will be a bit of a later on.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Also young pull-up checking in with a hit test.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's going to be awesome.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And lots of stuff to talk about.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Patricia is off for a couple days.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She has left me alone in charge.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh wow.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So you know what that means.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Got my cell phone hand.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You got everything here to organize the entire operation here at the house.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hopefully we'll remain undisturbed for the next 30 to 40 minutes as we bring you the daily source code.

54

The new music Tuesday on the Thursday.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Kick it off with a mashup.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000

The beat 51's versus Snoop Dogg.

225
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If that doesn't get you cranking on a day like this, then nothing else will.

226
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not ending rather abruptly.

227
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
By the way, I got a new version of MegaSeg that I'm trying out now.

228
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a beta version which apparently is going to take care of all of the dropouts.

229
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And the blitzlet we just see how to see what version it is.

230
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can tell you,

231
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,760
you, this is 3.1.3 beta1. Okay, thanks guys. Appreciate it. That is so cool. It's nice to know

232
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,920
that the so many folks will listen to this show and they're really trying to help out by sending

233
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,920
new software and this is definitely the place to try it out. I heard Madge Weinstein talking,

234
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,440
you should listen to the latest East Radio for the, I think it's for today for the 16th

235
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,640
Madge was talking about becoming quality control for Apple. I think that would be wonderful. I

236
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,760
can just see Madge at the very end of the assembly. Christ, my ass stinks. What is this damn

237
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,760
software? Okay, let's see. What do we have to talk about? First of all, yesterday,

238
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,560
not yesterday, I didn't do a show, but Tuesday night went to the Weezer concert at Brickston Academy

239
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,760
in London to Christina and her friend Ellie and this was all courtesy of Aaron from Parking

240
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,240
at Bitterman Square Circle from, well, his weblog and his podcast. I hadn't actually met

241
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:26,200
Aaron in person and man, he totally, totally hooked us up. We got there, we see around quarter past eight.

242
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,640
The band wasn't scheduled to go on until 915. So, went to Will call, they said, oh, no,

243
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,080
no, you have to go to the stage door. So, of course, immediately, I look like this mega

244
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,400
fricking hero to the girls. I go, yeah, we'll go to the backstage, come on, follow me, ladies.

245
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,480
You know, I got our VIP stickers and, you know, walked right in, no problem, right through the

246
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,960
side door into the, you know, right in front of the stage, literally. And it was great. The audience

247
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,840
was probably about the 30, 30-ish, of course, the band is now also a 30-ish. And it was good.

248
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,040
There was very mellow, very relaxed atmosphere and I hadn't been to a concert like this in a

249
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,360
long time where people were basically lighting up all over the place, which made me feel

250
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,880
right at home. And it was good. It was kind of a mix of just people who were out for an evening

251
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,880
to see some, you know, listen to some music, very low key, you know, a lot of pushing and

252
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,440
shoving up front. Although there was plenty of crowd surfing going on. And I think that Christina

253
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,040
and Ellie actually started a mini mosh pit right up near the stage. Man, that was rough, you know,

254
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,200
you know, here's your 14 almost 15-year-old daughter. And, you know, and she's there,

255
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,800
they're smaller than most of the people in the audience and the edging their way forward. And I'm

256
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,840
trying to keep my eye on them in a certain point. You just lose sight of them. And, uh, and just hope

257
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,760
for the best. And so everything worked out great and they had a fantastic time. Of course,

258
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,560
when they came back from the front of the stage, they had both lost their VIP special backstage

259
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,160
stickers, which, uh, is, that's a lesson they've got to learn. You know, you've got to hold onto

260
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,800
that stuff. So after the show, um, you went to the backstage area and I called Aaron on a cell phone,

261
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,120
explained the situation. He said, no problem. And within three minutes, he was right up front,

262
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,920
and he had new stickers, and he had more. He had a set list for each of the girls, which he took

263
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,120
right off the stage. He had drumsticks. He had guitar picks, even vintage guitar picks from the band's

264
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,800
2002 tour of, uh, Japan. I mean, it just, it was so great. It was cool to meet up with him and,

265
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,080
and chat with him about, you know, his view on music and podcasting. And what a great guy.

266
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,440
And I really appreciated Aaron. It was just fantastic with a great night out. And, uh, you know,

267
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,720
the, for me, the best part is, I don't know if you know how kids are, you know, kids, they take a lot

268
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,960
of things for granted. And, um, you know, kids are kids. But on the way back, uh, Christina said,

269
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,760
hey, Dad, I really had a great time. Thank you very much. And please thank your friend, Aaron.

270
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,680
And, and that did it for me. And I was like, whoa, okay. I've, uh, I've succeeded. So, um, and

271
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,240
also, let me just say about, um, about the band. Of course, I can't play a, uh, a wiser track because

272
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,840
that would be freaking a la, freaking a la. Um, very good. I really, uh, liked it. Sound was good.

273
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,520
It's a tough house. I think for, uh, for vocals, particularly, but the sound was very good.

274
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,760
And there were very much more technical than I expected him to be, uh, the, the guitar was just

275
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,760
unbelievably technically good and, and just rocking. And I recognized a hell of a lot more songs

276
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,200
than I thought I would. Great show. If you have a chance to see wiser, they're going to be on the

277
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,360
road road for quite a while. I think, uh, all over the globe, but I believe they're even going to go

278
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,000
back to Asia. So, definitely check them out if you have a chance. Good show. Good time, you know,

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,120
it's about our 15 minutes boom. It's, uh, it's just, uh, it's exactly what you, what you'd expect from a

280
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,920
a nice kind of pop rock, uh, show, but by mature musicians. Let's put it that way.

281
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Great news. Um, about ipodder.org. We are in the midst of, um, talking to some

282
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:07,800
people. Actually, one person. It was very, dear to me. Um, ipodder.org is essentially the directory.

283
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,240
It's the directory that flows into, uh, pod catching software. It's the directory that's going to be

284
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,320
used for, um, you know, for a whole bunch of big pod casting initiatives. But the problem for me with

285
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,000
ipodder.org is I started this out and I started working with category managers who all, um,

286
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,760
some of them I, I worked with for a long time to help them figure out how to create an

287
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,480
opml file, how to, you know, get that into the directory and how to maintain it. And what you notice

288
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,760
with some, oh, boy. I'll be my wife checking in. I don't want a second. Hello.

289
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,920
Hey, babe. I'm, I'm in the middle of the show. How are you?

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:01,960
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm strong. I'm not a show. I'm a bell's outrich. I'm a bell's outrich. Love you.

291
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Mm-hmm. There we go. Uh, where was I? See, that's what happens, you know. They go away, but they

292
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,680
try and stay in touch the whole time to make sure you're doing everything right. Um, okay. So this was

293
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,720
really a community. Uh, and I was in touch with all these different people and as things start to get

294
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,080
busier with the show and with with pod show as well, I've been able to do less and less and basically

295
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,960
the automatic scripts are running and that's updating the home page and that's not always working

296
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,560
as well. So it really needs some care and some energy. And so we're looking at hiring someone to,

297
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,760
to really oversee that and really bring out all of the opportunities that are there for the category

298
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,520
manager for the node managers. Everybody who's works so hard on iPod or.org. So stay tuned for

299
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,200
some news about that. No damage announcements, though, for right now. We're just going to keep

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:01,240
it the way it is and I'll get back to you soon as I can. It is New Music Tuesday on a Thursday

301
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,040
pod safe. This is Chrissy and gonna be on a daddy's source code.

302
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I've never picked someone here. You've been in last place.

There's no question, you and I, I know that you don't matter, I'm tired

308
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm a zombie, I don't wanna be, all you think is when I keep your eyes on me

309
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,680
I'm a country, not a way to see, yeah I'm a country, I'm a country

310

All you think is when I keep your eyes on me, I'm a country

All you think is when I keep your eyes on me, I'm a country, I'm a country

312
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Yeah, I'm gonna feed no witness to you, I'm serious

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Well, I'm gonna feed no witness to you

Do you wish me to spice up your sex friend?

317
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I'm actually a non-alances, but I'm your hostess

318
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Hi Adam, I'm Alexis

You're probably lucky enough to be among the 72% of couples that have a satisfying sex life

Oh yeah

321

Hello Adam, we had live by thedrop.com

339
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Thought that if we got a celebrity to endorse our podcast

340
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,680
We might get lucky and have our promo plate on your show

341
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
So here we go

342
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Hi, this is my profession

343
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,680
I'd be from the show, on my family and my friends

344
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,680
That I'm so happy that you supported me

345
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Just as prevailed today

346
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,680
I would say I'm not guilty on all counts

347
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I told you everything

348
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm so glad everybody believed me

349
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,680
I love children, and I would never do anything to hurt children

350
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,680
So thank you again for all your support

351
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,680

Okay, we'll sound a little bit muffled there when Michael broke in

362
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
But I had me fooled almost for a moment

363
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Okay, yeah, quick shout out

From Pasadena, California Adam

366
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
It's just introduced to the whole podcast world a few weeks ago

367
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680

There's an entire community of fuller seminary students

371
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680

Just go to show their fans and all sorts of places

375
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Looking forward to more good stuff from you

376
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Thank you very much, appreciate that

377
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Can you have printed them all out today

378
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm so incredibly well prepared

379
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
See that was a double one

380
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Okay, oh yeah, it's amazing who listens to this podcast

381
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,680
I think it was must have been about two weeks ago

382
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Hold on a second, my phone is about I think

383
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Can I already hear that it's about

384
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Okay, now yeah, that my phone is going to ring

385
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
It was about two weeks ago

386
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
When I was talking about what I thought

387
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,680
It was an interview with audible CEO Don Katz

388
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,680
And so I talked about I didn't actually replay that

389
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Because it was a very long interview

390
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,680
I thought it was on the media or future tensor or one of the NPR program

391
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Which is I'm not sure now if that's what it was

392
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,680
But it came across to me and maybe that's just the way it was put together

393
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Because of course, you know most interviews are cut up and spliced apart

394
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,680
And you know the host interrupts the flow

395
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,680
It came across to me that if you have a choice as a big company

396
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I consider audible to be a big company

397
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
They've been at it for quite a while

398
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,680
I think oh man how long have they been in business like eight years and nine years

399
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,680
I heard I think was Don Katz talking and I said you know

400
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,680
It sounded like if you could choose between a extend or defend

401
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Strategy as it comes to as it pertains to podcasting it felt a little bit

402
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Like audible was taking a defense stance more than an extend stance

403
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Well low and behold what shows up in my inbox today

404
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Audio feedback from the CEO of audible

405
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Hey Adam I was listening to the daily source code the other day

406
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,680
And was surprised to hear you talk about an interview with the CEO of audible

407
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Well that's me I'm the CEO and I started the company

408
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,680
My name's Don Katz and we actually lived a few blocks away from each other in Mont Clare, New Jersey

409
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I was a writer for Rolling Stone in the 70s and that was before

410
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,680
MTV came along and went way around Rolling Stone

411
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,680
And God knows we didn't defend let alone the extend as you often put it

412
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,680
As a new medium took over Rolling Stone

413
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Anyway, I think you got me name wrong and the interview you were referring to was with Rob Greenley on the web talk

414
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Radio on IT Conversations show

415
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,680
But as I listened to you I realized there are a few things I wanted to share with you

416
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Based on your comments about the interview

417
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,680
I'd also love it if you ever wanted to come to audible and check out the technologies we're rolling out

418
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
So I want to extend an invitation

419
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,680
So the first thing I want to say concerns you take in my comments about the explosion of podcasting

420
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
And the correlation I made to the DVD market

421
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I think you said that I played down the explosive potential of the audio download culture

422
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,680
When I said that iPods and other players are where DVDs were in the year 2000

423
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,680
In fact, the one of 10 people who owned a DVD back in 2000 exploded the 7 out of 10

424
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,680
And just a few years as the price of DVDs went from where iPods are now to under 40 bucks

425
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I've always said that I believe this is where MP3 players and memory rich phones are going

426
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
The best is yet to come

427
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I expected the explosion of digital media years ago

428
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Way too early and I've got the scars to show for it

429
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,680
So a few people are happier and more euphoric about the growing awareness of digital audio downloads and I am

430
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Now what I can be accurately accused of is believing that the podcasting environment

431
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,680
As opposed to the iPod culture is where DVDs were in early 1996

432
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,680
That brown the time I got going with audible, not like DVDs in 2000

433
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,680
We had to invent the first digital audio player between 95 and 97

434
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,680
And we brought out the first software system for secured downloads

435
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,680
And we put together an end-to-end system for delivering the content

436
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,680
And we built a business model too, all this way back when

437
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:59,680
And we've learned a lot about the things that simply have to happen to make the listening experience as powerful as the audio itself

438
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,680
We haven't talked much about how we're extending as opposed to defending since we don't like to make damn announcements

439
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Until we're satisfied with the service we're going to have

440
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,680
But we'll be releasing podcasting features for audio producers in chunks of new functionality over the next few weeks

441
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,680
And months starting at NomeDex in Seattle on June 23

442
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,680
So if your game, I'd love to extend to you the same gentleman's agreement you had with Steve before the Apple podcasting announcement

443
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,680
And tell you about the new developments we have planned

444
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,680
In fact, if you're in London this coming Wednesday night, come to the launch party at Hush and we can talk

445
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,680
If you want to meet knock-around ideas we have podcasts, we could even do one together and that'd be great

446
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,680
So when we are in other, we're keeping an ear on pod show, so bye for now

447
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Alright, thank you very much DonCats CEO of audible.com

448
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:54,680
And a couple of things that are very interesting about, first of all, it's unfortunate I didn't get this and the invitation until this morning

449
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Which means I missed the launch party, which was happening in London last night

450
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,680
So I sent him an email and he got back to me immediately, he's still in London

451
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,680
So I'm hooking up with Don tomorrow morning before he heads back to the States

452
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,680
To my old stomping ground, the willabric mall and New Jersey was just so fantastic

453
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
That's where audible is headquartered

454
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Something else I heard, which I really dig, is he said no damn announcements

455
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,680
I think we're changing the vernacular and vocabulary of Silicon Valley here

456
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,680
They used to be able to sign all these tough and non-disclosure agreements

457
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Now it's just hey look, no goddamn announcements, that's an NGDA

458
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
No damn announcements, NDA

459
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Gentlemen's agreement, I'm really liking that

460
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,680
So of course I'm going to hook up with him tomorrow

461
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,680
And I will come back to you my audience with as much as I can as I can

462
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,680
And if I were to put up a slide on a screen in front of an audience

463
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,680
And I said okay, who are the big players or who can be potentially big players in podcasting

464
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,680
I certainly would say Apple Microsoft and I definitely would have audible up there

465
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,680
So it's great that he's reaching out and look at the tools he's using

466
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,680
He's reaching out using our tools using the audio

467
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,680
So I'm very, very excited about that

468
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Wow, okay, it is a new music Tuesday on the Thursday, the 16th of June on the daily source code

469
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,680
I have another pod save tune for you, this one was sent to me by Art Wixen

470
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,680
It's a mashup actually, Dave Matthews and something else

471
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
And it's a father's day mashup

472
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,680
I ain't got daughters on the daily source code

473
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,680
For all the daddies out there, that's you too

474
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:48,680
I know a girl she puts the color inside of my world

475
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:56,680
But she's just like a maze where all of the walls out

476
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Continue to change

477
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,680
And I don't know like it

478
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,680
To stand on steps with my heart and my head

479
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,680
But now I started to see

480
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

481
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Some people live for a fortune

482
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Some people live just on the face

483
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Some people live for the mouth

484
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Yeah, some people live just on the face

485
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Some people pay and no business are paid

486
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Be my name once we've been and I've been

487

And every phone and life's above all

488
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,680
All the support they show

489
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,680
It's so beautiful but I don't want to be now

490
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,680
And feel it you baby

491
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
I ain't got to go baby

492
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Some people want nothing to be

493
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,680
Some guys want everything

494
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
But every lady's nothing

495
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,680
But you can go

496
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Yeah, fathers bigger to your daughters

497
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,680
The daughters will love like it do

498
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680

500
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,680
So mothers bigger to your daughters

501

Oh, you see that skin

502
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,680
It's the same she's been

503
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Standing there

504
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Since the day

505
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,680
She saw him walking

506
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Now she's left

507
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Clean it up the messy day

508
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Some people say

509
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Oh, I'll take

510
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,680
This is for the young

511
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Some people think

512
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,680
We know they're around us

513
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,680
And it's known you're way to prove your love

514
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,680
And we know we're all

515
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,680
On the silver matter

516
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,680
And what's going on in me

517
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,680
We know when they share

518
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,680
But no one who is true

519
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
We can't

520
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Call me

521
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Some people want it all

522
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,680
But I don't want to be now

523
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,680
If it ain't you baby

524
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,680
If I ain't got to go baby

525
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Some people want nothing

526
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Some just want everything

527
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,680
But every lady's nothing

528
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680

00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680

Daughters will have like you too

532
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Because we come to mothers

533
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,680

Most will be strong

538
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,680
And more souls are out

539
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680

Look at us forever

It's nice to have three CDs to us

612
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,480
We've played a couple of us tracks on the Pod Cho

613
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,960
Good stuff dig it. I've really been getting into some mellower stuff lately and that really fits the bill for me

614
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,840
And it just did immediately get kind of cloudy and kind of dark and rainy and all by myself and feeling feeling just so lonely

615
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,040
But then again, there's always light at the end of the tunnel and it comes in the form of

616
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,440
Yon Polas

617
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:48,920
Hey Adam, this is not a hit test. It's 44 already. It's a special edition because you have to recognize

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,360

Answer shout tears for fears

641
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,600
Okay, that's it for today. I had just a little bit time left this week to create another one

642
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,760
Then I'll be on a short trip. So the next one will be next week

643
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,960
Oh, by the way. I hope you had them all three

644
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,840

649
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,880
Yeah, that was interesting though. I like doing that trying to get the high hats, but I was not sure about Amy Stewart

650
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,920
That's Amy Stewart the original Amy Stewart AMI. I think it is Stewart knock on wood and really if you're if you're

651
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,920
I feel no long drive and you know you're kind of like feeling sleepy and but you know

652
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,640
You can't pull over. We don't want to pull over and you've already stuck your hand out the side of the window

653
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:05,320
Get some air flow in on your face. Then the best thing I find to do is just go shout shout that really that wakes me up

654
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
I hope it woke you up too

655
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,160
Seeing as it is new music Tuesday on this Thursday, June 16th

656
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:20,280
I think it's time to play a song by one of my favorite bands who I haven't played this song in a long time or any of their songs in a long time

657
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,400
Actually, it's just from their first album, which I think came out in 2002, 2003

658
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:36,600
I met them through podcasting and it turns out that they are now selling their music by the track or by the album on the iTunes music store

659
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,160
And I actually purchased the first album. I had had I had received it from the well

660
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,880
It's I'm talking about the lascivious bitties. I had received all of the traction their first CD

661
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,720
They just let me download them in MP3 format now. I have the really high quality. I guess it's was a aces

662
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,160
And I just played it over and over during the weekend and Patricia was listening to and it's just such good stuff

663
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,360
And I I felt like I really needed to play another track by the bitties from bitty locks

664
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,840
Here's headed south on the daily source code

665
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:34,200
Rose on the ground bitter taste in my mouth since my love

666
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,600
It ends up

667
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Since my love

668
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
It ends up

669
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:58,600
We first met at a side she looked at my head

670
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,320
Let I do keep one hand

671
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,320
Oh man, no that's that sucks

672
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,920
Now this thing was working perfectly for the entire show

673
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,960
The entire show mega sag is just cranking out the tunes doing great and then all of a sudden during the song that I want to vibe to the most it starts to crap out on me

674
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,360
Man, I'm wondering if it has something to do with with the AAC final hold on a second

675
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,040
Well, I'll do as I'll do this. I'm sorry about this. This is not what I intended

676
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,360
What I intended to happen. I can literally see that mega sag is frozen up. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with

677
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,240
With that file because when I was importing it, I saw that it got stuck there as well

678
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,280
No, if only I could get oh my god for like it. I tunes to work. Uh

679
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Oh, what am I gonna do here?

680
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
Almost sick

681
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,720
With no cares in the world or one day

682
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
You're falling down

683
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
That you're

684
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,120
It ends up

685
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,120
That you're

686
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,120
It's up

687
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
That you love

688
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Oh, the end you sound like an angel

689
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,720
Lasivia's bitties headed south and I'm sure that was some kind of digital rights management

690
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,960
And snafu that happened there, so I apologize for that go check him out on the items music store

691
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
The Lasivia's bitties at the end of the source code

692
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,920
Man, I'm sweating from that. You know, it's like sitting there and going like oh, what's happening?

693
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,720
Otherwise mega sag's been performing very well. I'm very happy with it

694
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,360
So we found another bug we can work on. Ah, thank goodness and that's it for the new music

695
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,560
Tuesday on this Thursday June 16th of the source code

696
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,520
Of course tomorrow morning I'll be meeting with Don Katz as I told you see you're a lot of ball in London

697
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,600
So to show maybe a little bit late as I probably won't be home until early afternoon

698
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,440
But I will have lots of fun stuff to talk about I hope

699
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,080
At least the stuff that

700
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,040
Doesn't fall under the no damn announcements rule, right?

701
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:44,040
