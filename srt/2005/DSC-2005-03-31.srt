00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Fletcher's dribbling down the center core. Here we go. Hey, everybody

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,860
Welcome to a daily source code special edition from the curry condo in

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,120
South Beach

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Or is this actually is this Miami Beach or South Beach? I'm not even going to tolerate that as a question

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,420
This would of course mean that it's

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,640
If you don't know the answer, you don't qualify okay residents and

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
So it's a special on the road edition

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,840
been here on vacation and

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Ron and I thought it would be Ron Bloom my friend partner and co-founder out

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,640
Boku communications and do you hear that home all the sudden?

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,160
Yes, our neighbors maybe some of the colleges. Yeah, so we've actually got a pretty interesting set up

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,800
We're on the balcony here in the in the building Ron lives in this building and

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,280
We're renting an apartment for our 10 day stay. That sounds shitty

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Where'd that come from all of a sudden?

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,640
You're much level here not another level here

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,040
And oh, they know how more sounds like you're a blackberry. Oh, move that away

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,340
No, no, wow. It's the coffee. We'll live through it. Yeah, actually these might so we've got a the task cam

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,480
Pocket studio five that we're using as a mic mixer and we're both wearing these headphone

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,520
Microphone deals the headset with a mic that come you know like the Jan Jackson microphone

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,080
Which actually makes us look more like to highly under qualified guys doing a

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,680
A play by play at a college basketball game. I must say I didn't enjoy your wardrobe now function

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Half time and so we're sitting on the balcony

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,640
Overlooking let's see, that's the is that the Miami skyline

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,920
That's how Miami you're overlooking this game bay

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,760
And that sounds much better than the Miami skyline. I love the Miami skyline

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Metropolitan Miami right you're listening to the airport flying over here because this week we're in the flight path

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,320
You know, they take off that they move it around. No, they don't move that around to please you

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,960
They move that around depending on the wind. No, that that's the other part. I mean noise control

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,360
You watch a no bank hard to the left. Oh, okay

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,380
I mean we call that noise abatement. Yeah, you do. We just like get the fuck out of my sky

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,380
Okay, Ron, so

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
There's a cup actually

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
It's as real treat to have you on the show

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
appreciate you making room on the couch. Yeah, okay

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,400
What's your you know, maybe we should set some stuff up first cool. So people know who you are they are they all know who I am

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,520
Do you want me to drag it out of you or yeah, that's the probability of something ring the pitch

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,200
So maybe we should okay, well, you're from Atlanta. That's where you were born born and bred. Okay, and you're how old?

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Lenty

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
That's not 20

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,800
That's twice 20 plus okay, but your roots actually aren't necessarily business. No, no

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Well, my roots are in entertainment

42
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
musician

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
a bag of bond

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,760
20 years on the road

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,360
And I'm gonna make it home tonight. You see you joke about it, but

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,640
You're well since we didn't establish your age, but you're old enough to have I did you actually play on some stocks records?

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
Yeah, I played a

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,520
A lot of R&B sessions in the 60s early 60s as a guitarist

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:45,040
And when you live in the south, you learn how to R&B pretty early so we we were a small group of musicians that ended up being in bands like

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,640
They came from the R&B world ended up being in bands like Leonard Skinner and Almond Brothers and the those sort of southern rock R&B inspired bands

51
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Mm-hmm, and I played I became a session guy and a songwriter

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah, anything that we might have heard

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,440
Let's see now I was fortunate enough to be involved in one of the few songs in history. We are the world

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Almost as interesting one of the few songs in history to be a top 10 record in two different

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,960
Generations same same song. Okay. I would know it. You would know it. Okay

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,840
It's like a hit testing how many bars and it's out. I'll tell you the the first line of the chorus

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
If I could fly

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,560
Is that a if I could fly

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Is that bread?

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Okay

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
It's not even water

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,800
But that's what I'm gonna be having it's a song called Into the Night and it's it was a hit song by a Benny Bernoude

63
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,880
Benny Mardonus any more down. Yeah, sure. We recorded that song. That was a huge hit number one. Yeah, I'm a one single yeah, and

64
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,400
Eight years later after all the drug money was used up with Benny for the next record

65
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,320
Was the advance for the second record you don't do drugs. I didn't ever have but he he did he did enough for both of us and

66
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,540
The second record didn't quite go anywhere but the first record had into the night which was a nice big hit and

67
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,220
Then about eight or nine years later after not speaking to him for a while he calls me up because they were running

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,700
In the band back together and some a disjocke and

69
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,260
Texas I think

70
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,400
Played it as an oldy but it had been been so long as since anyone heard it. They thought it was a newy right and they started requesting it. Yeah, sure

71
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,180
I know there was no record in the poly polygram

72
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,180
Didn't want to re-release it cuz they left on hard terms

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,020
So we went out and we re-recorded the single a sound alike of our own record really

74
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,060
Over just to own the master just to have a new master right and that master went up to top five

75
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,460
I don't think it made it to one but it like number three year number two. Yeah, cuz I was at MTV when it was getting a lot of play

76
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,820
Yeah, you go there you go

77
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,440
So I'm associated with a few of those in other records and bits and pieces and if you're watching late night

78
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,720
HBO or Showtime and you see some really bad B movies like a high school movies like you know more like Chuck Norris movie

79
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,080
Yeah, the bound to see some of my music hanging out

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,240
Now you didn't you do some business with Chuck Norris sure enough did we had a kung fu studio

81
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,760
Really, yeah, we had a recording studio well we called it audio post production

82
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,600
It's a very professional. We did post production for cannon films and Warner Brothers films out there in Los Angeles

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,560
Had a beautiful studio built into a villa and we ran that for about three years

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,720
During which time I made lots of lots of records and lots of lots of songs for film mostly be movies like mixing in action

85
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Missing in action, yeah

86
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,080
Really you score for that not the score where lots of keys on yeah, and you know you see him for everything from

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Disney movies like pre hysteria, you know children movies all the way up to

88
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,640
Movies of the other opposite ill-quare. There's not a lot of where your name is not rom-bloom, but then dover

89
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
He doesn't have a lot of dialogue

90
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,040
How a lot of dialogue and those but lots of room for sound the movie. I did the voice over for the

91
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,640
The voice dubbing got a fully wrecked penis or word from hustler magas. Yeah, I think I got a couple of those things too

92
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
for them on my

93
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,040
astounding hair raising or maybe it wasn't hair

94
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Soundtracks

95
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Okay, I was in Los Angeles

96
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Yeah, man. I was in Los Angeles

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
And I was running the studio process and then I started thinking about this internet thing

98
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
Don't you skip the whole really important part when talk about Stephanie

99
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Stephanie's simplest junior. Yeah, that one

100
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
Stephanie. That's an important part. Is it? Yeah, I think so

101
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Okay, all right

102
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,080
So I won't delve into it. You just give me the highlight the executive summary

103
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,720
Executive summary like where do you meet her? I was like the first time Kavalo

104
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Hello and far-knowly who managed

105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
Prince

106
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Asked me to remix some

107
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Prince artist music and

108
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,120
I did that and put some the prints and

109
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,200
Myself have it the only two people in the United States that had this thing called a fair light

110
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Which people do they call Sam?

111
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Walk

112
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Fairly was awesome man and

113
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,800
So

114
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,920
Disem stuff with friends or four prints and the same management company picked up Stephanie

115
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,840
Stephanie, Stephanie princess Stephanie of Monica. Yeah, yeah

116
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,960
That's a one of the managers over there call me and so hey, you know

117
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
I had already built a reputation for writing music for people who really couldn't sing

118
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Kind of one of those myself were you behind me leaving you that guy?

119
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,400
That's right fair

120
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,040
Yeah, but between not being able to sing and not singing at all

121
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,400
Yeah

122
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Yeah, you know people like

123
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,280
Jack Wagner. I'm a song for Jack Wagner

124
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Excellent

125
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
I can sing pretty good, but it's not gonna be

126
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Not gonna cover off the ball those type of people

127
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,040
So

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,080
The idea is to write a song that that person can handle so they ask me to write some songs for Stephanie

129
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
And she came over to studio. That's how I'm there

130
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Okay

131
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,440
To be in the rest of the history to be continued one day. Yeah, okay

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
So

133
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
So then you start hearing about this internet thing so you were basically in LA you were

134
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,920
You're probably like just running around right trying to get some shit going on trying to get something happening

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,480
Well, I sold this studio right yeah, and I was with freelance producer just writing songs and working on tracks

136
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,760
And when I had worked on the fair light I started I had sent some files back and forth through the internet and

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
I started hearing about this thing called a browser

138
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,600
And I started screwing around with it. I'll you remember this old machine. I had the hardly worked in a dialogue dude

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
Where you had all the sounds for every single finder effect

140
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,600
Yeah, loser you're like so bad. I had a very swapping out files just to play this plug

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,640
Yeah, I was like into the sound thing. I did it. It's nothing

142
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
I'll never forget that. Yeah, okay, so

143
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,400
So you know man this got to be something to this I think I think this possible to

144
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,360
To reinvent music by bringing it on to this internet thing. So I'm checking around. I'm writing a

145
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
info Marshall and

146
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,400
Was that golf licks and not quite but it was of about credit repair which we all needed at that particular time

147
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I grew and

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,480
And we needed a producer a camera man sound man in New York and we found this guy named Rick and Kilman

149
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
and Rick Kilman

150
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
And I were talking during the break of filming this awesome info Marshall

151
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,320
And he says you know I know this guy named Adam Curry who knows this internet thing

152
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I said you mean long-haired

153
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Video god Adam Curry

154
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Now what did you really say

155
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
That dark I said is that dark a geek or that geek adore

156
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,160
Uh-huh, so Rick Kilman was the audio guy at MTV. He was also all he's a radio guy

157
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,960
He does all you know anything that has to do with sound and he does he's a piece of work

158
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
And so you know

159
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,880
I said well if somebody this is just out there as Rick Kilman says it Adam Curry's kind of cool

160
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
He also said he did Adam Curry was difficult

161
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Really? So I said well if he's difficult

162
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Yeah, I said if he's difficult and you know that's kind of guy I want to work with

163
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm pretty difficult myself and so I cold called you that's right and you were kind of had one foot out the door at MTV or you were kind of

164
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:56,080
No, I think I was already you out just already out. Yeah, and I and I was sitting in an office with Brad Sirling. Yeah, and did I have

165
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,280
Do we have any other people there not yet just Brad right? Yeah, at Media America. We're sitting up there

166
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,080
With a half an ISD and line trying to

167
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,800
I share some internet a chair in a box. Yeah, literally a chair really that because when we had our meeting we had to pull in another box

168
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,880
I talked to you on the phone. I said hey man. I got this idea. I want to do this music thing on the internet

169
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,440
And I want to do it for the Grammy Awards because I knew the guy that ran the narrows the National Academy

170
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,240
Recording Arts and Sciences and I've done some music work around the Grammy. So I figured I would try to convince them to sponsor the idea

171
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
Bring in music online and you said cool

172
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,400
Yeah, you know, and then I came to New York the next day. That's right. I showed up with you like your black blue jeans your black

173
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,880
Adams and you're you know like black cowboy boots, you know way too hip for the fucking room black

174
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:56,320
Major black ass actually like attitude, but yeah, yeah, man. And then and that was a very enchanting because as many have said

175
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
After me

176
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,400
You've tell a story like Kenny you've been just a saxophone. I was I wove the web. You know, I didn't build a web. I just wove

177
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,600
So it's okay, so from my perspective that was like, oh, it's guys got something happening and

178
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,720
Did I didn't I agree to come out to LA the next day or two days later? We go back together. Yeah, we went to the next day. Yeah, all the way back to

179
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:28,720
I would know no plan on how to sell it. We went down to the narrows. They just moved into this new building and then right my green

180
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,560
And

181
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,080
Rob's sin. Oh, Rob's and I forgot I was gonna say what's his name right. Yeah, both George boys and

182
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,400
With the aquarium in the office. Yeah, he was real proud man. He had a beautiful office. We should go get that thing

183
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,120
He built a beautiful building and probably available. Yeah, you know, he he took the Grammys not many people listening probably know

184
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,400
I bet it Grammys was an inch away from exhibition. It was a death brand. No one wanted to fucking do anything with it

185
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,160
And he's got a little bit of craziness in his in his recent background, but man. He rebuilt that brand and

186
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
What we said to him was hey, you know

187
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,680
It's tired. You know in the Grammys is it's a tired brand for tired old people and if you want to get hit

188
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,040
You got to do something with the internet and he he said a very intelligent thing. I never forget what is the internet?

189
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,240
Yeah, this internet used to be go. What is that?

190
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:29,680
1994. I was like a October 94 right and we proceeded to explain what we thought it was and we came up with this idea that we called a cybercast

191
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,280
And that it not what the internet people think of it today

192
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,160
But for us it was a simultaneous. We were going to use television radio

193
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,400
And the internet see you see me. Yeah, and

194
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,640
Well, okay, I'm getting ahead of us. So we're more the story or later

195
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,240
Well, yeah, we'll do that later. Yeah, we'll just move forward the Grammys story. Yeah, so anyway

196
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
So long long story short. I said Ron

197
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
Was it before the Grammys or someone else had to well

198
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,960
Once you come on in take half the company and let's go let's go build this fucker

199
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,120
It was during the Grammys disc trade. Yeah, we kind of looked. I think we realized it

200
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
I think we realized we had a vibe in a way out of partnership and instinctively

201
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,680
At least for me, you know instinctively we just started splitting the work and getting some done and not bitching about it

202
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Finding attracting smart people good people. Yeah, so then we'll just

203
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,400
Because there are lots of stories and we should certainly talk about some of them in podcasts in the future

204
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,960
Yeah, but then eventually we wound up taking our

205
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
Company

206
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Public I mean that was actually I remember we had a conversation in the hallway and the conversation was okay here are choices

207
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
we can

208
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Go take money from

209
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
John

210
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,960
And be his bitch, but in a good way yeah

211
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
In a good way

212
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,320
Or we have a maybe a once-in-one lifetime opportunity to take a company public

213
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I think we both what's right there went

214
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,320
That's doing the public thing. That's going to be interesting, but that was 95 that was way before the bubble the first question we asked was what's public

215
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah, how does that work? Yeah, that was that work. Yeah, that was a really good ride. Yeah, that was I was most excellent

216
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, you know considering what we've learned about people who think they have it down

217
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
I thought we handled ourselves pretty well

218
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,800
So we went through everything that a major a major corporation goes through without lying

219
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,920
Yeah, exactly and then you know we we built a business over a hundred million in revenue when we were selling that yeah, that was real money

220
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,480
Real money yeah, I mean a big payroll too

221
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,400
We do we have like four hundred and twenty five employees or something like almost five hundred

222
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,240
Crazy 60 million bucks a year payroll

223
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Holy moly so

224
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,360
That that was merged into another public company. Yeah, and they're still around and they're still making my little money

225
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,560
It's always yeah, it's some of our original guys are back out on their own and lots of our original guys

226
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,680
They're all over the place. We see to the whole generation of misfits that really talented and there's still an alumni list that

227
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
Twenty-four all still post two once in a while, so yeah, and

228
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,960
And anyway, so we've been in touch often on for the past five six years

229
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah, we sold we sold it in 99 and we been on enough since then

230
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
And

231
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Then what happened?

232
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,080
In the middle of that we tried a couple of ideas. I mean, I think that I think that both of us felt

233
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,480
That this idea of an individual being self-publishing or we we thought of it as self-casting

234
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,640
Was going to happen yeah, because you got into

235
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Well, do you could you got into some interesting stuff with mesh networks and cable network?

236
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,480
I tried every possible form of technology. I could to convince any big company

237
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,680
That upstream was as important as downstream, you know

238
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
Yeah, close up all the time

239
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,920
And you had jambi and you were doing some really cool stuff and

240
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,080
You know, I came out and visited you in Holland. We almost did the jambi thing together and then you almost did capacity with me and we went back and forth and yeah

241
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,840
And then

242
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,640
And you know that it was just the drive to you go

243
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,160
Some place you know different and then you found it you found it you called me last year

244
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
One of those out of the blue calls that I learned to expect from you

245
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,640
That now other people have come to expect from us. Yeah, you know Lance is always like oh

246
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,800
There's Ron. Oh, there's that. Yeah, yeah, there's 30 years there

247
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,040
So yeah, it's a bridge. We hadn't burned yet. That's pretty good

248
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,840
You said hey you said they do it. I think I really have it this time. You know, and it was sound in your voice where

249
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
You know, I just said all right

250
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,120
He probably does it feels right even before I heard what it was and you said, you know

251
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Look, it's very simple

252
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
File make your own stuff

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
Distribute it yourself. Yeah, and and and I said this is fantastic

254
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,000
You know and we immediately I think started doing some interesting things and at least talking about it

255
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,520
Which is the way we started the last big thing we did yeah, but for like months months

256
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,200
We talked for it. We really attracted for a long long time and you know

257
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,440
I think I think we made a commitment then to be to not overstep it on a commercial side and and let

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,200
The listener the potential audience tell us if they like the idea let the potential production audience

259
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,400
You know let us know if they if they dug doing it and

260
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,080
And to set it up, you know to use what we learned in our last adventure to our benefit this time

261
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
You know

262
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
so

263
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You know, I subscribe to

264
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Just millions of feeds and millions of podcasts. I'm listening to everything and everybody as much as I can

265
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
I have my life as one big podcast

266
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:01,760
And I came across this podcast just before we got on the plane to come down here or over here over and down here

267
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
From something called

268
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
dreadful snake radio

269
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,560
I like it already. Yeah, it's really cool and it's a creative bit which maybe we'll get tired of it halfway through

270
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,520
But it's worth listening to a little bit of it because it addresses some concerns that

271
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
The podcast community

272
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
You know, which means

273
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,560
I don't know what that means, but it's there's noise out there. You know, there's a lot of people want to know what's going on and there's like

274
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,280
Odio came out with something and then they didn't have something and now they have something really cool and and no one really understands what we're doing

275
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
That's good

276
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
I think is really great

277
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,920
That's the first step in doing something well exactly so he so we put together this

278
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,080
Podcast called money and podcasting a semi rant and he just asked some questions which you know

279
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,120
I think would be fun if we just listen to him just address it. Let's do it. It's it's a creative little thing

280
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,400
Come on, let me see dreadful snake radio. Yeah, I was so

281
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
So if you want to stop it just raise your hand y'all

282
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Set funds on bread

283
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,720
Well, hi, this is dreadful snake radio guy and

284
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Today's subject

285
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,760
It's about podcasting and I'm directing this

286
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Conversation to anybody that's interested

287
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,160
But if you're if you're not a podcaster yourself

288
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,080
You may be going

289
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm not sure if I know what this is all about

290
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,440
But give this a shot if you are into podcasting yourself and

291
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,440
Then I think this is really an important topic

292
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:47,920
So I'm gonna try to wax eloquent here. I've been mentally calling this a rant as I've sort of prepared some of the thoughts for it

293
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,680
You actually tell you why it is really sort of a poll-revere

294
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Warning thing

295
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I want to stake out

296
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
All around podcasting

297
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,480
Just as another line of thought because I see this podcasting as a movement that's at a crossroads

298
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,720
And I want to address some stuff that Adam Curry is bringing to the marketplace right now

299
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
See why I want to do here

300
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Yeah

301
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,720
You got to listen to this. This is great. It's about this. He did some like bits. You'll like it. It's really funny

302
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
And it really has to do with the fact that this movement

303
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,400
may become a marketplace and this is not an anti-adom

304
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
That's a that's a good

305
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,920
The movement become a more marketplace thing. It's a matter of fact

306
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,600
Adam as you'll you'll hear when I do this is kind of a hero a mine

307
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,880
I think he's an incredible talent and has the potential to bring this in this movement if you will

308
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,760
To a place where it will be incredibly better than it will be today

309
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,760
But I'm a little worried

310
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm a little worried. I'm a lot worried about some of the stuff I hear around it's me so bear with me here we go

311
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,800
Here's what I have in mind

312
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,640
Okay, this is not an anti-adom Curry statement. What this is is it's a plea

313
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,520
It's a plea for keeping

314
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,440
Populism popular and keeping access open

315
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,760
In podcasting. That's one of the things that's the coolest about podcasting is it's an absolutely open movement

316
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:34,080
I was involved in some early television when cable TV started coming out there was a movement called gorilla TV the Michael Shamburg

317
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,280
Did you ever hear of that? Yeah, I'm a gorilla TV man. What? It's like outgold scene

318
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,440
It was a lot of that stuff down south too with it. Really? That's a real time of return

319
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
Irundated in cable in his own way really

320
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,320
And the blue channel you know gorilla TV the blue channel and the york you know the blue channel

321
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,480
Yeah, that's what Robin bird and all that stuff. Yeah, is she still on well? I know Mr. Cameron man

322
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,280
Come on baby bang my box. We used to love watching that when we first moved to New York

323
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,280
That's sweet. We digress

324
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,480
We dude Howard Stern is gonna make a hundred million dollars a year

325
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,840
Let me just tell you something. Yeah, this is something you're gonna enjoy. Yeah, okay

326
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,600
250 mercer my old pad and yeah guess who had to be for me

327
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,200
No idea you just said our name dude

328
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
Robin bird had your pad 250 mercer

329
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,760
Did you meet her that's what I heard? I'm sure but there were some things on the wall that you heard about the bird heard about there was a wood

330
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
Little Robin bird all right back to this dude. Yeah, all right

331
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Was the spearhead up I was involved in some of that stuff. I've just from time to time

332
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,840
I mean, I'm no revolutionary, you know, I'm a

333
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,200
Believe me, I'm not but I've been involved from time to time in these grassroots movements and I see what happens to them

334
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,920
The money comes in thing. I really think we're to cross roads and we got to make sure that we don't let the money aspect

335
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:13,200
Take this great possibility that's podcasting down the toilet of commercialism like it has on every other form of media that we've seen out there

336
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Wow, he's flushed with excitement

337
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,400
But isn't that misguided? Well, yeah, I mean isn't this completely it's like

338
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,520
How can money control anything? Well

339
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,520
The only way that money controls is if there's a limit of resources to broadcast

340
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,520
If there's a limit of number of resources money can buy up the resources and control it

341
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,520
So the real thing that's going to choke off podcasting is going to be lack of enthusiasm from content

342
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,480
People if they don't do good stuff good enough stuff to attract attention then

343
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
It's going to be the victim of its own

344
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,960
Self out of the evolutionary chain right so but and and

345
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,640
Why do creative people not show up to the party? I mean they're they're here, but so what if that what would make that dry up?

346
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,880
Well, what that what happens is we have to simplify the process of letting people be creative

347
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Look and let me try something else out on you

348
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,480
Okay, one to one communication through the phone. You know one to one audio

349
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,400
We've had 60 70 years to get every permutation of it you could possibly have

350
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:32,320
From from cell phones or regular phones to conference calls to calls with messaging and all these different things that are happening

351
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Well huge industries

352
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Have grown up around one to one communication, but now we have self publishing and there's no

353
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Real industries around self publishing

354
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,280
Web logs

355
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,880
Is the first hint at an industry and an industry doesn't have to be commercial

356
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,640
Just has to have enough people to crank a wheel of progress, right?

357
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,480
So but that so it's an industry then web logs now isn't it? Yeah, it may not be a commercially successful one

358
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:07,040
But it's industrious and it's self perpetuating, right and and there's millions of people self publishing and millions of people listening

359
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,080
Reading there's not millions of people self publishing and billions of people listening

360
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
This is different

361
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,400
Is that again? There's millions of people self publishing right and there's millions of people reading

362
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,000
But the ratio of readers to self publishers is not of the typical ratio of a normal medium where you have a narrow amount of providers

363
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,920
And a large huge audience a large amount of consumers so what what needs to happen in

364
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,680
Podcasting at least in my arrogant opinion is that the that there needs to be an

365
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,120
Constantly open doorway for anyone to self publish

366
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,520
Filtering mechanism for them to find the level that they want to which they want to rise in their self publishing endeavors

367
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,080
And then all of those publishers need to support each other in a manner that drives the audience because some people want to listen

368
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Some people want to speak and

369
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:05,120
Podcasting is an is in a method for one to speak to many and the many can be one to two or it can be one to two million

370
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,120
So this this industry where other than saying this commercial industry is is waiting for

371
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,240
People not to worry so much about whether there is money or isn't money and start talking about how we all band together

372
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
We're going to track listeners

373
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
You care about what being said

374
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,440
Because that's the that's the bottom line is if we could spend you and I could go raise a hundred million dollars

375
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,720
And we could get we could foster all kinds of podcasting make it free for everyone to do it in the end if no one wanted to listen then that's it

376
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
We'd have you know

377
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,320
What was it X football triple X football?

378
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Whatever that was

379
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,320
Hundred million dollars of wasted effort of something that one was interested in we're part part of the beauty of podcasting is that

380
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
And this guy will get to it actually

381
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,560
Oh, hold that thought let's listen to it because he he

382
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,760
He actually asked the question that I would come up with next so let's go explore that topic in a couple places, okay?

383
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,200
Let me you like this format. I like to form that in

384
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,080
He start with a sound effect and asking you what you think it is here we go

385
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,200
No, this is the comedic bit. This is funny

386
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
So what is this sound?

387
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,200
Okay, what do you think that was that whistling wind sound? It was a whistling. There's two choices now answer a

388
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:39,040
That was the Microsoft evil empire blowing smoke up Adam Curry's butt by sending him a new machine that shows video of

389
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,920
Demembers of Doran Doran personally addressing Adam Curry

390
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,320
Backing him in and hypnotizing him into the evil empire of Redmond Washington

391
00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:00,480
Or Doran Doran backwards is not rude in a rude it could be me and 4,000 other potters

392
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,520
Trying to blow smoke up his ass also trying to get a mention on his show

393
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,120
I know I've done it I sent him emails that he's ignored so what I'm trying to say is

394
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,120
I guess we're all pimping our stuff and I don't want to just say that Microsoft is doing it

395
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm doing it to I'm I'm trying to get people to vote for me on pad podcast alley

396
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,240
I'm I'm pimping my show there's no doubt about it

397
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,360
But Microsoft is pimping our technology to add him and everybody like Adam that's a leader in this industry too

398
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,080
So there's a lot of that stuff going around and I only mentioned that because

399
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,640
It's going on and let's realize that a lot of the big corporate interests are realizing

400
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,080
Maybe this is something that's going to take off and people are worried about it people are interested in putting some money into it

401
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Let's see what happens now

402
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Let me specifically address a statement to Adam for a moment

403
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,720
Adam you are one of my heroes you are the

404
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,920
Does this will does a hot God that's my that's my thing for you the PG and then you are the pod god

405
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,640
And they're I just want to ask you to be careful

406
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:22,000
About where you take this movement we've got because it sounds like you want to take it from a movement

407
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,160
To an industry so let me examine that word couple of key questions question number one

408
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,080
Adam Curry can you actually take it somewhere and my answer is yes, I think you can and here's why

409
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
I consider Adam Curry a leader

410
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,920
Of what's going on in podcast

411
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
What's the definition of leadership?

412
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,840
You know, I do not work in business. I know what that means and I know that leadership can only be judged

413
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,720
If people follow that person then they're a leader now there's a lot of things that make a good leader a bad leader

414
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
A mediocre leader

415
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,720
But the bottom line is our people following will frankly many many of us are following Adam around

416
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,800
I want to know what makes a good and bad

417
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:26,400
Mastering means I've got a lot of great ideas about podcasting from Adam let me give you an example his whole concept of how podcasting is the new community radio

418
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, that's awesome. You know radio is a small community that's that's a small you know AM broadcast radio

419
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,320
But now with podcasting it's not a

420
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You want to slow down listen to it later

421
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:54,240
This yet, but I'm recording it. It's a content community how I think about a good podcast is it's a content community and the boundaries of this little country is

422
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,880
The content and people that like it. It's not geographic. It can be anywhere in the world

423
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
It can be the wing commander and antwerp

424
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
It can be you and sorry

425
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,800
It can be me and the northeastern United States or whatever

426
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,440
So anyway, this is exciting stuff my point is Adam you are a leader

427
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,920
Many many of us are listening to you on a nearly daily basis and the we are interested in

428
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,080
We're taking the industry so be careful about what you say to us because we're kind of following here

429
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
He has a point there

430
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
Absolutely

431
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,520
He has a point oh in here. Okay. We're kind of following here. Okay question number two

432
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,720
Where are you going to go with this question? You've got to bring more dollars into this medium

433
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:49,840
That is content rich dollar poor medium today now. Let me explore that do you agree with that content rich dollar poor?

434
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
No

435
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay, no

436
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Is it content poor dollar rich? I

437
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
understand it. I understand it

438
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,880
I understand it, but I'm old enough to have seen

439
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,680
The birth of FM radio, you know the birth of independent record labels and and

440
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,120
There's a content and it's going to the beautiful thing about podcasting

441
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,360
The different from a lot of things out there is that it is at the content can find its own level

442
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,720
So I'm not sure content rich, you know, you can have a ton of content that's no good and you're never going to support

443
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
Holistic industry or revenue generating industry

444
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,360
What's great about podcasting is I believe that

445
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,400
That you're going to be able to have room for content to find its own level the long-tailed concept, right?

446
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,120
So a guy who is not that exciting but talks about something that a thousand people are in love with

447
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,240
And interested in they find an audience in podcasting right that can be commercial or non commercial

448
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,880
But if they do it right and we do our job, right that person be commercial or non-compare be a priest or a mechanic

449
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,720
Can can contribute to turning podcasting into a medium

450
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Which it isn't yet

451
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
piggybacking on other things

452
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,800
But to be a true global medium it needs to have an audience

453
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,160
That that consolidates itself in admits that it is following the content, right?

454
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
So to be a medium

455
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,920
What's challenging about podcasting is we're inventing the technology we're redefining the content or what you and I would call format

456
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
And we're trying to to demonstrate it. It's a medium all at the same time usually usually it's a chicken or egg

457
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,600
HD TV

458
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,040
It's a technology that was it trying to find an audience before there was any content for yeah, we're doing those

459
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
My pacemaker

460
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,120
We're doing those the simultaneously yeah in real time and and and that's what's that's why it

461
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,200
In some ways it's foolish in other ways it's foolproof because if it's it's really simple if it's no good

462
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,200
It's gonna die. Yeah, if it's good. It's really

463
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,800
Almost unstoppable right but so the the next question of what the disguise can ask it to is do you need money to make podcasting good?

464
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,320
I mean, that's gonna be a fine line between you know getting some extra money in this thing to live on

465
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,920
Money that drives better content and so on to when you get a lot of money into a particular media time after time

466
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
We've seen that money corrupts it

467
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,440
Okay, there's a fine line between that well

468
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,240
We don't have any money in this medium yet we're waiting for Adam to tell us sort of about pod show and what might come into it and all that

469
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,080
And everything Adam tells us about community and everything I feel really good about it's just I sort of see that there could be some dark clouds out there

470
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,320
But when Adam goes out there and he sells the sentio coffee maker on his site. Oh

471
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,280
Insert commercial here. I put it back on by the way. I changed these years. Excuse me. Oh

472
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
Yeah, wait a minute coffee break. Hold on a second

473
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Hmm

474
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
We actually could use a refill here

475
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Where's my my daughter?

476
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,600
Another commercial break. We're sponsoring her podcast. Oh, wow. What was that? Do we just lose volume?

477
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,440
Are you there?

478
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,320
Check this out. What happened there? That was really weird. Hey, how's it? Did you hit? Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you? I didn't I didn't

479
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,480
Do I do something weird? Did you hit your microphone volume?

480
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,200
Oh, maybe I'm sitting on it. That's totally possible. Hold on. Oh, thank you. Yes

481
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,920
That did it. Hello, he's the uh, okay, let the ass ask me to this guy. He's coming. He's got some creative coming up. Yeah

482
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,000
You know, I'm fine, but it's got some good questions. He doesn't give a rest of that

483
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,480
I'm feeling fine about it or not, but I gotta tell you. I feel fine about that. He's very up front about what it is

484
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Why he likes the product

485
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,000
Why his liking it is different than just selling it somewhere else. It makes a lot of sense to me. It really does

486
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:14,000
But what I worry about is occasionally I hear about well, there's other ways to do things advertising products

487
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,600
And I worry about you know somebody thinking out ahead of time not saying Adam would do this

488
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,360
But here we're gonna have a subliminal product placement strategy and then we'll get backing from a

489
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,640
Dodge Dakota and a Sancio and a someone so and I'll drop that into the conversation

490
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
What's this guy now? I mentioned something about a

491
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,680
What's he drive? Did he drive a Dodge? I think maybe I just wonder if I can

492
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,080
vagina and then I'll mention the car, but then we'll get the check to come in

493
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,600
Man, that is not the business model right there

494
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
vagina card check

495
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
That's Holland isn't

496
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,840
Adam or no one else is suggesting that but as this thing goes forward from a non-money media to one that has some money in it

497
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
We gotta find the right balance

498
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,160
We gotta find a way to make it viable for people that need the money they're doing podcasting

499
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,960
But it doesn't corrupt the medium itself

500
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,480
Question number three

501
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,080
I gotta take a deep breath here. In fact, I'm even gonna have a sip of water here and then question number three

502
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
This is where it starts to get very avian

503
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,920
Club love that was the water going down. Okay. Question number three Adam

504
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,880
You were choosing a group of potters if I can call them that to work with now what's great is

505
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,400
That we want to hear people with great content getting better and with better opportunities and promotion

506
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,000
So that the circle widens and the and the news gets out there

507
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,040
So far so good. Yeah, that would be great. We really are looking forward to that and I think that's where you're going

508
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Okay, but let me tell you what with suck

509
00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:00,240
What with suck is if podcasting becomes dominated by an elite group that has a louder megaphone

510
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,360
Then the rest of us so that the grass roots can't be hurt and I don't I mean

511
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,440
You know there's 4,000 of us now and I'm in there. That's cool

512
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,800
But there's gonna be 10,000 more behind me and I don't want to be the elite either

513
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,360
I want everybody to have a shot at building that content community that's out

514
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,840
To see where he's going. I absolutely do

515
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
But I ask him me

516
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Yeah

517
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,240
You know our strategy. We should address this in many ways

518
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:42,240
He is absolutely online and incorrect and I have you know questions that I would ask is has commercialism killed the internet

519
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
What do you think?

520
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
No, it's only grown a bigger

521
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,240
Of course and and now we're discovering more

522
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,600
Look you can look at it sideways and say

523
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,440
You know podcasting is for people who communicate

524
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,640
Orally and the internet has been mostly for people who communicate with text

525
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,680
You know obviously not completely true, but there's a different way to look at it and and because

526
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,440
Our mission is to enable everyone to make a quality program

527
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,720
That is a good enough for a million listeners even if only one person is listening

528
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:27,600
So that's step one to make it take to provide the bandwidth the tools the utilities and the access

529
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,920
To millions of listeners to any individual at a cost that's equally almost almost free and totally affordable

530
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,560
We'll um we'll have include a hum like we have yeah that

531
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,360
Extra and what I learned and my record production days is if you can

532
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Can't cover it up turn it up right?

533
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,240
Okay, what we're doing good with that that's not a hum that is a that is that they just think to air filter feature

534
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,360
So did you just say that this is gonna be free or not?

535
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,120
What did you just say? I think they'll be

536
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,560
First of all there's free and there's also freedom right so there'll be levels of free and levels of freedom

537
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,480
To the extent that you do not want to be that you first of all everyone should be able to make

538
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,000
Broadcast quality a podcast quality pod show quality podcast. There you go

539
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,600
That's what pod show is about is creating a quality of the product

540
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,800
So every single individual cost effective. They should be able to make a pod show quality podcast and when you make a kickass

541
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,160
Production of a podcast with with user friendly tools and you're really making a pod show and if you aspire to make a

542
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,000
Pod show quality podcast that should be within everybody's reach that's step one

543
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,840
Step two everybody who's interested even for split a nanosecond and and listening to pod

544
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,640
Has to be able to engage them quickly and effortlessly and get to what they're interested in or discover things

545
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
They didn't know they were interested in

546
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
I number two number three

547
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,760
For those who are interested in the monetary aspect of monetizing you know the aspect of monetizing

548
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,840
They're making making money making money. There should be a mechanism and it should be a fluid mechanism

549
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,040
One that's that enables a person with 10 listeners to make some money on the weekend

550
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,440
And one that enables a person with 10 million listeners to be able to make a life career out of it

551
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,360
And there's and there's that person will not the only thing that's louder in terms of a megaphone see

552
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,240
See the metaphor or the or the analogy falls flat because podcasting

553
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,880
It's not a megaphone business a megaphone is in implies broadcasting, you know

554
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,840
Podcasting means everybody has the same megaphone. At least if a pod show that's what I think we're trying to do

555
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,520
Get everybody the same megaphone give them everybody the stage

556
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,840
Try to find unique ways of filtering the contents of it can find this way to eager audiences

557
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,800
And a bizarre way it's what eBay or Amazon does when when they're at their best

558
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,800
You know when you're trying to find a when you're interested in just in cooking and you want an alternative recipe book

559
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,360
You can you won't find in your local bookstore

560
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,680
You go over to Amazon because pretty much someone is written a book that's only good for 10,000 people and there it is

561
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,600
That huge database and a great search and you believe in them

562
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,560
You and they're filtering it there and they're telling you that other people like this Tuscan cooking book and

563
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,840
Particularly people who like it who are on low fed diet

564
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Like pod cast alley ratings

565
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
rate and and

566
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,040
And there's enthusiasm ratings, you know, this is all the rant about podcast alley ratings and

567
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,480
People voting a thousand times. Well, you know, there should be some some room for people who I love this so much

568
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,000
I call it a hundred times

569
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's how much I love it

570
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,360
It's probably shouldn't be room for people to go. I love this so much. I programmed a line of code to vote for me 10 million times

571
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
You know, there's a business there for somebody

572
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,400
But yeah, I think there's room first of all

573
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,960
How do you how do I like like me? I find out about podcast by listening to you by asking other podcasters

574
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,520
They're asking people what they listen to sure so on officially

575
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,960
I'm going to people I admire and I'm asking him we need to get that

576
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,000
We need to not assume that everybody who is a listener is a fanatic about podcasting

577
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,200
But maybe they just wandered by because they're interested in stunt something and if we don't grab those people

578
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,840
We don't just forget the business. We don't have a medium

579
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,040
We don't grab the casual listener and infatuate them like the dedicated listeners are we don't have a medium

580
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,320
Okay, so there's a lot of work. So yeah, there's work to be done on making

581
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,400
Lowering the barrier for anyone to produce. But we can do that. Yeah, well, yeah, totally

582
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,080
But then on the other side it's also really making it much much easier for you know for the audience

583
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,960
So the audience can find it so we don't go through all that how do I how do I find these things questions?

584
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:04,400
And that's what you know as a as a listener who's not a podcaster that that's what I send my message out to podcasters and to the

585
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,000
technologist which no one is talking about who are out there helping

586
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
You know

587
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,880
unsung heroes the technologists who enable this thing to happen unsung heroes people who manage

588
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,200
Directories that that their love is not the podcasting, but their love is listening to the podcasting and helping

589
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,280
Regular people find what's what they think is good in them. They're guides the guides and there's many many

590
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,200
constituents already in our hopeful medium that are already unsung and we haven't even gotten to the poor listener yet who is now got

591
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:42,400
4,000 things to you know we're acting like 4,000 is in a lot that's too much. Yeah, and you know so our mission is to figure out

592
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,800
How to let how to make it okay for one podcast to have 10 listeners one podcast to have 10,000 and one podcast to have 2 million

593
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,080
and all of those people live in the same universe and that's what I think we can do and the show will be the same quality

594
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,200
It's just it's just destined to find the different level when you say quality you're talking about the actual audio quality or you're talking about

595
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,280
What what does that mean? Good question. It should it it should have the same

596
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,880
production

597
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,040
Content quality so that you wouldn't turn something off just because it sounded bad

598
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,800
Like this like this and or it should have the

599
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,680
For those tools dude, yeah, quick. Maybe one of them is a hammer aimed at my head

600
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
It should have also

601
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,200
You know enough

602
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,080
rope for people to hang themselves or people to be incredibly creative right on and you know

603
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,200
As a musician it's what I saw happening in home recording you can make you know you know upstairs

604
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,880
I have a pro tools rig. Yeah, I cost me a million and a half dollars to build my last studio. I want to cost me

605
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,320
You know

606
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,960
$25,000 to build this when I could probably start over and do it for you know five grand. Yeah, and

607
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,680
It's it's nuts how how free it is and how great it is for musicians

608
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,720
So now we're talking about self publishing audio in a different way. So we we let people do it the next thing that we need is

609
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,680
most people who are making podcasts are self producing

610
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,680
And in music that works and doesn't work, right? So there's a good good analogy in music producers and artists are separate

611
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,560
And they bring out the best of each other reason. Yeah, and yeah, and you know these to say what makes a great producer and the answer was a great band

612
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:28,800
Yeah, and like Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones. Yeah, George Harrison. What did I say George Harrison for?

613
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,320
I don't know and George Martin and the Beatles and the Beatles. All right George Harrison was a beatle, wasn't he?

614
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Yeah

615
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,640
Hey kids don't you want to be cool all the kids are drink and say oh, so you know

616
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,440
You could say no no commercial interruptions in podcasting everybody just pay

617
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,280
That's one way to do it. You could say no everybody gets it for free, but we have to write on the back a big brother

618
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,680
That's another way to do it. Why do people need to be paid?

619
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,240
If if you want to pause the stupid question, I think it's a good one

620
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,360
People don't some people will want to some people will want to quit their job

621
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,400
Some people have family some people will want to survive on their creative craft and be paid for why doesn't that work with weblogs?

622
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,120
Or why isn't it working with weblogs?

623
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,840
Well, I think that I think that web logs

624
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:32,400
You know, I've heard everything about weblogs and one of the most interesting thing that's we don't we don't break the news

625
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,680
We fix the news you know, and we triangulate

626
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,640
I think it's cool and everything, but I don't I don't know if that's

627
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,120
Exactly

628
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,720
What the essence of podcasting is podcasting is about non-trient and meet non-trient Galation. It's about

629
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
injecting personality

630
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:00,000
and giving something that someone to someone who that's interested in listening to it. You know, when MTV started

631
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,240
a great record executive lamented we just lost the last great thing you could do with your eyes closed

632
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,080
That that bringing videos to music meant you couldn't close your eyes listen to the lyrics and think of your own video

633
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,920
And I think podcasting

634
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,880
brings that back. It sure does and I'm not sure what what web logs

635
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,040
brings back. You know, and it's interesting because you know web blogs are email or whatever it's all basically the same thing

636
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,360
But it's I have to agree that web logs kind of started out as things like new sites and it's always going to be kind of like a

637
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:37,200
newsy-type medium. You're in general. I mean, of course, specifically that's absolutely not true

638
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
But and podcasting did kind of start off

639
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Just as you know, no news to report because we all know it's delayed. We all know you're getting this late

640
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,080
There's like, you know, we found Osama bin Laden. I'm glad you're tuning in everybody and just getting this late break in news

641
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,600
So there's something different there that makes people communicate differently and you know, and a word

642
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,480
You know, it's hard to say, but if you find a great

643
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,720
author

644
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,720
that that is out there

645
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,520
contributing information and text and wanted to syndicate what they say

646
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,360
I think in the early days of newspaper, that's that's what happened and and

647
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,520
Maybe people would pay for that if someone wanted to charge for that

648
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,640
Now people think of it as how do I get the latest information about stuff?

649
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,160
You know, and you don't hear as much talk about the electric rap rapping

650
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,240
eloquently

651
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,680
How what great

652
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,920
content would great turn of word or phrase this person is you're hearing about well

653
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,720
Six people found out that he wasn't telling the truth and they posted his picture and that then that type of thing

654
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,760
I think in podcasting you go man that guy was funny or while he really knew his subject

655
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,880
Or can you believe this this couple that live out in the farmhouse? Okay, you know you you're not saying wow

656
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,960
Let's turn on the podcasting and find out if what you know what British said is really true

657
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,600
Right, yeah, this is yeah, you're right. It said that is a very different vibe in podcasting true

658
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:12,560
It's just just take a break from reality or find a different version of reality, and it's also appealing to a sense

659
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,360
The listening sense that we have there's been definitely by fucking flat top 40 crap radio

660
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
That's right

661
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,400
The whole line just want to play a little bit more this guy and we'll quit it

662
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,840
So which way is this going to go is a chosen group of people that are getting to get some money in this thing

663
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,960
Gonna make the circle wide and so it's better for all of us

664
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,720
He gets funny words about are we on a dominate by a leak group. I don't know

665
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,160
We don't know which way this thing is going to go yet, but let's keep an eye on

666
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,640
Okay, let me tell you when it comes to you know what I just talked about

667
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:52,000
It'll be great to have folks like Don and Drew who is the other podcast that I listen to constantly

668
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,840
That and frankly I got to tell you I get a real week spot for closet deadhead too

669
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,840
It would be great to have Don and Drew and a lot of other people have access to whatever

670
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,880
Makes better content and distribution for them man. I love to see that

671
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,120
But I tell you I

672
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,960
Just said two very important words there content and distribution now here's one guy's opinion

673
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,080
What the hell does Don and Drew need to get better content look what they do on a farm and was constant for God's sake

674
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,960
I mean what's what what else could you do?

675
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,200
Let's put Don and Drew on the space shuttle Don and Drew and outer space

676
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,200
You know, I mean waitless punani may have its possibilities

677
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:41,600
But Don and Drew's success is not in having a fancy set right with Dick Van Dyke walking on it and tripping over their couch

678
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,600
Don and Drew's success is about Don and Drew as

679
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:54,560
People reacting to each other and the world around them and we're all getting to feel comfortable about them as we get to know them

680
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,200
And I want my Don and Drew and I don't care if they're in outer space or not and it has to do with them as people

681
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:09,840
I'm getting comfortable with them like one generation did with Johnny Carson and another one is now with Conan and John Stewart

682
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:16,400
You know and I mean any screenwriter will tell you that the whole thing starts and ends with great characters

683
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
That's Don and Drew so

684
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:26,800
Between content and distribution. I don't think putting money in to help in them with content is necessarily going to do a damn a damn thing

685
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,800
Okay, Don and Drew man. They're like they're like

686
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,520
Cool as there's like Lucy and Ricky and hot as Paris and Nikki

687
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,640
Oh, there's Kenny G. It works again. It's calm. It's just coming out like a waterfall

688
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:54,160
So he's describing what what is he talking about okay? He's saying that he's trying to figure out why why podcast and needs money or why we need why we need money

689
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,840
Well, I want to make money or what we want to do and he's he's gonna split up because I say it's impossible

690
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,920
That it's for the content so it has to be the distribution. That's what he's gonna say well, you know

691
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,560
Here you go 4,000 podcasters

692
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,400
Let's say they have an average of 300 listeners

693
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,000
Okay, that's probably fair. Yeah, what is that?

694
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,600
100,000

695
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:23,840
And I just lost my math if all of them if all of them got together and decided to recommend

696
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,480
Shows that they like beside their own like like sort of like you do yeah, but in their own way

697
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,280
And all of them made it their mission to to bring not just their show, but other shows

698
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,080
Selfish selflessly out to the universe and we have a listener base of let's say half a million

699
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,640
Do a million people listening to podcast today two months we could have two million in two months

700
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:53,760
We could double that easy if the 4,000 podcasters were selflessly promoting themselves in other podcasters

701
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,160
Okay, there's a distribution for you. Yeah. All right. Here's another kind of distribution

702
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,280
God forbid somebody woke up tomorrow without asking for it

703
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:10,560
And had five podcasters on their iPod or their MP3 player other laptop waiting for which five

704
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,520
As a question to ask

705
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,080
Which five will that be different for everybody wouldn't it? Well, you know, let's let's talk about that

706
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:24,400
Let's let's say that you could wave a magic wand and go out to 10 million people

707
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:33,280
reasonably good target audience people that might like it and put and you had 4,000 podcasters to choose from

708
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:41,040
And you wanted to put five or three on their laptop or their PC or their

709
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:47,120
MP3 player that they would guarantee they would listen to and then from that they would make a decision

710
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,320
And whether they wanted to stay in the world of podcasting listen to more which one to a

711
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,920
Would you choose your own or would you somebody else? Well, yes, I would choose my own start off with

712
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,640
Because I'm a gateway

713
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,280
God of pod. I do a horror

714
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:09,120
Okay, so is there a right answer to this? I think that that many of the 4,000 podcasters might have to think maybe they're not on that list

715
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,440
That in order to

716
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:19,520
Get more people lined up to find they need to get 10 million people listening to find the 50,000

717
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,520
They're going to listen to you

718
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,680
Right, so you need

719
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,400
So you need something out there to draw people in you need to just strip is just you need to distribute

720
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,520
We don't have a medium that's where they're messing up with distribution you need to pick 5 or 10 great shows

721
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,800
And you need to get them out to 10 million people so they get hooked on the concept they know come and find the ones

722
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,760
They know right, that's okay. That's what I'll say so that should be the role of the pod squadty type things

723
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,080
It's not it's not for them to be the elite group

724
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,640
But what the rest of the podcasters should be doing is fucking making sure we have a pod squad

725
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:59,840
And aspiring to get that group distributed as leaders to create the market, you know to create create the medium

726
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,360
Okay, how many listeners do we need before we instead of how much money are we gonna make? How many listeners do we have?

727
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,360
We need to 100 million to be really significant. Yeah, to be significant. How many do we do? All right, so

728
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,920
What's our distribution goal?

729
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,560
And yeah, maybe it's a hundred million

730
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
so you and I know that there's ways

731
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,360
To get

732
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,360
millions of people to have a listen

733
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,360
Mm-hmm

734
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,440
And that's I think some one of the things we fear the most because we know how to do that. Yeah, and the question then becomes

735
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay, here's your shot slugger

736
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You're gonna put it right and

737
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,320
We better be selfless again and make sure that we're promoting the very best of our breed

738
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,360
In order to hook the rest of the listening world to come in and find the stuff that you need to them. Okay, that makes sense

739
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,640
Hey, we should start a company and do that

740
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,320
Man, oh man, what an idea now could they use better

741
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Studio sound

742
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,160
Because it's a different part. I just been listening to the early shit

743
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,840
Let's do it

744
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:19,220
So um, but before I get there I just want to say that any effort to really do better content through adding money to it will be marginal at best

745
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
Now

746
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,280
Here's what we addressed that

747
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:28,080
Could happen and I want to give you a little he forgets that

748
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
I never mind

749
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:39,200
iPod play here and what I want to do now is take you to a little tour of what could be the dark side

750
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:47,200
And here we are as we enter Adam Curry's iPod plantation where the workers are sequestered

751
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Shall we say over that thing barn building

752
00:59:51,200 --> 01:00:07,200
This is Adam Curry and thanks for joining me on this tour of the iPod plantation

753
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,200
I have the chosen ones hard work on new content right in here

754
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Let me just open up the barn door and you can hear what's going on

755
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Or since they'll coffee I've got to get a creative idea

756
01:00:42,200 --> 01:01:05,200
I made a sound seeing tour of let's go over to the real barn run

757
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:12,200
Yes, open up the door our secret door. Oh look what's inside

758
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,200
Everybody's party

759
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,200
All right, that's enough of that. What are we doing?

760
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:37,200
We should definitely wrap this up. So what are we doing?

761
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:44,200
Everybody will be able to make a world-class quantity podcast they will have the tools

762
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:51,200
They will have opportunity to make the audience this we will do. Are we going to build all that?

763
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,200
We and other people who will help us in building

764
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,200
We are really totally screwed.

765
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,200
We are going to bring we are going to try to bring together some really smart people

766
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:12,200
And really talented people smarter, more talented than us who are going to help us make this thing real

767
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,200
There's Patricia just as we are winding up

768
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Man, I thought it was a vision

769
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,200
What is it?

770
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,200
If you come leaning into the microphone

771
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,200
A long one

772
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
A long podcast

773
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,200
It was good though

774
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,200
Yeah, but we talked about all kinds of things

775
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
I thought she wasn't talking about the podcast

776
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,200
Okay

777
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
Well thanks for having me

778
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,200
No thanks for being on the show this is good

779
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
And this is an extra long one so

780
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,200
People can

781
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,200
You drop out to my guest

782
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,200
No way

783
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,200
No way

784
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,200
This is going to get analysed and exerted everywhere

785
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Yeah

786
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,200
I don't apologize in advance

787
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,200
So when can we make some damn announcements?

788
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Any moment now

789
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,200
As a matter of fact

790
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,200
I hate that answer

791
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,200
The clock is ticking

792
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,200
The clock is ticking

793
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,200
Well really really really really close

794
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,200
Being able to begin

795
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,200
I think the first thing we are going to try to do is just

796
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Be a little more forthcoming about what we have in mind

797
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Thank you

798
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,200
And we just want to make sure we can articulate it without

799
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Even more bullshit than we sound now

800
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,200
So first thing we are going to do is kind of tell everybody what we are going to do something unusual

801
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,200
We are going to let everybody know what the strategy is

802
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,200
Exactly

803
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,200
Just lay it out

804
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
And then

805
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,200
Rather than saying that now we are not taking any steps towards it

806
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Immediately afterwards we are going to start doing things

807
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
And making announcements

808
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,200
And I hope everybody who is interested will see that each one of those announcements

809
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Is part of a strategy

810
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,200
Then you can tell us if you think we are crazy

811
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,200
And maybe we will change the strategy

812
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,200
But you didn't talk anything tonight about the two way

813
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,200
You know the interactive part of podcast English

814
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,200
No but what I would like to do is

815
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,200
Like maybe not this long this is just kind of like an introduction

816
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
But maybe we can talk you know

817
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
I think we should do this more often

818
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,200
You know we should do it

819
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,200
Maybe at least once a week

820
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
And just talk to what we are doing

821
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
And then people can follow along

822
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
And indeed give us some of that feedback

823
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
Yep

824
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,200
All right my friend

825
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
Dude what time is it?

826
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,200
What country are we in?

827
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Oh kidding

828
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
It's podcasting

829
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,200
It could be any time any place my brother

830
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,200
That's right

831
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
Well we prove that once again

832
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,200
So it will only take me two hours to compress this

833
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,200
And upload it

834
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,200
Dude

835
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Let's just talk about the connectivity here

836
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,200
We have to

837
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Can we get DSL?

838
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,200
Absolutely

839
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
We have to

840
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
Because that's why some of your shit doesn't arrive

841
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,200
I mean you send a five or six megabyte file

842
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,200
It takes a fucking effort to upload

843
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,200
The last the last four megabytes on that

844
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Important anyway

845
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,200
Is it?

846
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,200
It's just the front page

847
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
That's how many

848
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
All right

849
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
Interesting what your page

850
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
Just the only one you need

851
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Okay

852
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Is that true?

853
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Yeah

854
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,200
No, but don't you have to

855
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,200
Put like a little thing on each page

856
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Well I think it's important

857
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
Everyone out there just sign

858
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
We'll fill in the rest

859
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Don't worry about it

860
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Thank you

861
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Yeah, trust us

862
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Hey

863
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Thanks everybody for listening

864
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Stay subscribed

865
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
And we'll check in later

866
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
This week with another

867
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
Daily source code podcast

868
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,200
Thanks Ron

869
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,200
You got it, thank you

870
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,200
Bye
