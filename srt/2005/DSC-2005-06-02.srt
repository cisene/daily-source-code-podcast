00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Daily source code, episode 187

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since radio is invented.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
16 million dollars worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's June 2nd 2005. Dammit's June already.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Everybody how you doing? It's Adam Curry back home.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's right, I'm back at the cottage and the weather sucks of course.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's always supposed to happen?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
At the heat wave when I'm gone, I come back and it's dreary and gray and raining.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And just the way we love it.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's what you'd expect from back home, isn't it?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome to your daily source code.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well plenty of stuff to catch up on today.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Of course it wasn't able to post a source code for it.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What was it the past?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Three days literally we had the Memorial Day weekend,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which was also a bank holiday here in the UK.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Which means that Christina's home.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She's off from school this week.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we're going to be able to do some fun stuff, catch up a little bit.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're actually planning on going to a play to show to London's West End,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
which she of course didn't like the idea because it involves theatre and boring stuff, right?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think we'll be able to convince her.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And I really must say it's nice to be back in front of the console with the familiar mixer.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Got my sound back, my microphone back, all the stuff that I can't take on the road.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I still got to come up with an even better portable set.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I still haven't been able to find it.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The most important part of the setup that I have now, I guess,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is the processing unit that I have in between the mixer and the recording device.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know, that's my firewire drive crap and out.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I told you about that, that I bought another firewire drive.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That one's working much better.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then these Lissie hard drives I have.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've had so many Lissie external firewire drives fail.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's unfunny.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And thing with Lissie is, you know, they'll tell you, hey, you know, they're kind of suck.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And, well, we'll replace it for you, but no, the data that's on the drive is what I really want.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Not a pleasant experience anyway, so the other drive is working well.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And hopefully we'll be able to get through the show with kind of everything hanging together.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm also doing the show standing up today.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm a little low on energy, and I've found that sometimes just standing by itself will give you,

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you know, that little extra edge that'll make you feel a little bit more up.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's been, see, yesterday I came home yesterday was Wednesday.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was actually the flight wasn't bad.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It was nine and a half hours from San Francisco to London.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Flight left on time.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was great. It was full, but not, you know, overly completely fully packed.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was just nicely full.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And they feed you nicely on Virgin Virgin Lannick Airlines.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They keep coming up with snacks and plenty of drinks, you know, and you don't have to ask for it.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And if you do, then they'll be happy to help you out, so that was cool.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Although, man, nine and a half hours, you know, at a certain point,

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I think that, and it's probably just, you know, it's just, it's all human, but my God.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Some people just let it rip, man, and the plane can really start to stank after a while.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's so fucking disgusting.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I understand that, you know, you're in the plane, and, you know, you're bloated.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're not feeling, you're, you're rocking around.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's five, six hundred miles an hour, you know, and you're eating food and drinking and whatever.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And so I understand that, once in a while, you may have to little, little, little gassascape, but please, you know,

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
get the fuck out of your seat and go to the bathroom and do it there where it belongs.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Jesus.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it's guys, man.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Guys do that the most, and it's just, well, especially the guys sitting next to me.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I contemplated, given some of his own medicine, but decided, well, maybe I shouldn't do that,

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
because you never know what kind of bad shit you can run into in that case, right?

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We have a kid.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mash up time.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Run DMC and a Reath of Franklin.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Rock steady in run-tiles on the source code.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Get the new kids with a feeling from the side side.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And while you're moving in run-tiles, let's stay the day.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's go this way.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000

Let's go that way.

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's go this way.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go this way.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go this way.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's go this way.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't care what it is, I don't care

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't care what it is, I don't care

127

I don't care what it is, I don't care

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Rock steady and runs house, a Reath at Franklin versus Rundee M.C.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Centos by Scott Petek has been sending in lots of cool mashups

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you have a mashup and believe me, I'd love to have more

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
responding, thank you very much, so if you haven't heard yet, just send it

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
off to mashup at podshow.com, same goes for promos, send it off to

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Submit at podshow.com and that podsake music pod safe at podshow.com

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know what it is, it's like, you know, for some reason

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it's got to be the LeC Firewire, because everything else is working, I've got the new tiger

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
OS10 release, which I'm actually pretty happy with, it runs very well

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
although there's a lot of conflicts now with the Apple Key Spacebar command

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
you've like this, now there are three basic processes fighting for that command, the first one

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was using this program called Launchbar, and Launchbar is pretty cool, I think the equivalent of windows

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is called Hot Keys, where you basically issue a control, an Apple Key Spacebar command

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
you do those simultaneously, and then it pops up a little menu, you type in the first couple of words

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
or whatever you're looking for, first letters or whatever you're working for, looking for, so for instance,

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
if I was looking for audio hijack pro, I just type in audio, and it'll bring up a number of

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
different options, and it basically remembers what you select on certain point, you can get it down

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to just the A, just type in an A, and it'll know, ah, he wants audio hijack pro.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It'll launch it when you hit Return, which is real fast way to get to your applications,

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and it does the same for documents and shortcuts and email addresses, and you can configure that,

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
very nice application. Then Megaseg, which I've been using to record the source code

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
with, or basically to play back with by, you know, lining up all of the, all of the elements

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and putting them, you know, in order that I want to plan back.

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When you hit the Apple Key Spacebar, and when Megaseg is running, then basically it starts

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the playlists, that doesn't work, or it actually it's segs to the next element, even worse.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And now Spotlight, which is Apple's fine feature in OS 10, uses the exact same command.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can change that, but it's kind of disorienting the first time you figure it out.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I like this Spotlight, because it works very much like Launchbar, but it doesn't seem as fast

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and it also doesn't seem to remember the command. So, you know, if I search for, basically it's a search function,

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
so if I do audio hijack, or just audio, it'll bring up a whole bunch of different audio

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
search results, including what they call the top hit, which will usually be audio hijack pro,

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but it seems like it still is searching every single time it's searching through your,

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I guess it was on internal database, or whatever, trying to figure out what you want.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It doesn't really remember what you selected the last time you did that search.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, it's a bit slower than Launchbar, but it does really get into everything, even PDF documents.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So, that's a pretty cool feature. I'm digging that. What else did I like about OS 10, I want to talk about?

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, yeah, the RSS of capabilities and safari. I'm kind of understanding how it works now.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now, I'm a one-paying aggregator guy. I like to have all the news in a reverse chronological order,

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
so the most recent updates at the top and then just scroll all the way through, which Dave Winner calls it a river of news,

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and I completely, you know, buy into that philosophy of that's the best way to parse all this,

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
instead of, you know, separated by feed and put it kind of like an email like client to view.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But there's, there's no way to import your subscription, so what you essentially have to do is take all of your,

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
your subscriptions, your bookmarks, really. You should be able to just drag an OPML file on it, with not be wonderful.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But you're not able to do that, so you have to take all your subscriptions, put them all into your bookmarks,

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and then it'll go out and basically look at all of those, look at all those subscriptions,

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you can set that to every half hour hour or a day or a week, whatever you want.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Excuse me. Do I need to tell you where the burps coming from? Do you think it's a sincere burp?

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And it's working pretty good. I like the fact that you can expand or collapse how many lines of text are associated with each entry,

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I'm kind of playing with it still, so I was able to, through a clue, basically able to import all of my contacts,

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
all of my, my subscriptions, but it would be nice if they had some kind of OPML feature,

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
also an export would be nice, so you can take it out. But it is working, it's, yeah, it's pretty interesting.

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see, I got a lot to talk about. San Francisco, that's where we were, San Francisco and LA,

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I basically the last half of our journey. I was going for 10 days, man. I'm so happy to be home,

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
happy to see the girls. It's nice to be back in, in the familiar environment, kind of get back into the swing of things.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But we had some great meetings in San Francisco with a variety of companies and institutions,

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and a lot of people very excited to work with us on the commercialization of podcasting, as you know,

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that's, that's entirely what we're doing, and there's going to be so much opportunity for everybody to,

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to go along with this ride. It's going to be a lot of fun. So I'm looking forward to making some damn,

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
damn announcements in the, in the near future.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I wanted to thank all of the, man, I got so many emails and so much feedback about the ear buds

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that I bought, the replacement earphones for my iPod.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And I'd gone out and I purchased the in ear buds from Apple and was very disappointed with, with the results.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
First of all, it's kind of hard to stick it in your ear ear.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And yeah, and you really have to stick them all the way in your ear holes in order to get any kind of base.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Basically, otherwise it's, you know, it's all like high end, a little bit of mid-range sound.

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's just not shitty. And the, the most interesting comments that I got back were,

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
first of all, there's a, there's a way to insert these in ear ear buds.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And the way you do it is you have to lift your ear low up with one hand.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So, not your ear low, but your ear at the top of your ear.

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And then open your mouth like you're going to yawn.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And then you stick the ear bud in and then you let go of your ear.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then essentially it's in, in place.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And that does work, although it's kind of weird because you have to do it a couple times to reposition.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But the best advice came from Mad Weinstein.

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
She said I should go out and get the Sony in ear ear buds.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
They come with three different sizes.

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Because I know not everyone has the same earhole size, right?

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And although they work even better probably with the ear trick, you can just kind of stick it in your ear.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it works and those are really good.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And I'm digging those a lot.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Very comfortable. You can keep them in for a long time.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And they don't, you know, slip in or out or slip out basically.

236
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And yeah, so those are pretty good.

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Although it does have the behind the neck loop that we've discussed before.

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So it doesn't, you know, the, the two sides of the earphones.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The earphones aren't of equal length, which means basically the wire doesn't go down the middle.

240
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But it goes down one side.

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So you, you know, the wire runs down the left hand side.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And then you bring the right hand ear, but around the back of your neck and plug it in.

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Which has some advantages.

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I don't know, just this kind of like a, I guess kind of like a dyshockey thing that I've always wanted to have that.

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Have it in the middle.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I like it hanging in the middle if you don't mind.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000

Fantastic kids, Adam Curry.

260
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Adam, do you remember saying this about me?

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The one that I promised you about that I think has a lot of promise.

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And there's a lot of people who are totally into the Beatles.

The Beatles Dread of Hot Cast.com.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a new podcast that I'm launching because I am a certified Beatle Nut.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There's no more trivia than I care to tell anyone.

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I'm the guy that sent you that Beatles baseline trivia thing that you sing to enjoy.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But, you know, I didn't share it too well with it.

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But hey, that's another story.

272
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
All Beatle Fans, all Beatle Nuts.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Go to my new podcast.

274
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
BeatlesTrivialPodcast.com.

275
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Where we discuss the Beatles, their music.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You know, anything magical.

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I interview people from all over the world that have either known the Beatles or been with the Beatles.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Or just people who love the Beatles.

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
One of my first shows that I've got a commitment to is Tommy Roe, who was a famous 60s artist

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Buddy of mine from, you know, had dizzy and sweet pee and he tour.

281
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He was the headliner and the Beatles were his warm-up act.

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So we're going to have a 20-30 minute interview with Tommy.

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Just talking about all the fun of that 1962 tour with Tommy and Chris Montez.

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So check it out at BeatlesTrivialPodcast.com.

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Right on.

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Very cool, actually.

288
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, I sucked at the baseline trivia quiz.

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We should bring that one out again.

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
See if I can't remember even though I know the answers by now.

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No new hit test from Yon Polet.

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So I guess he's busy in the rehabilitation.

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I hope you had a chance to check out his hit test podcast where he goes into more depth about his condition.

294
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And it's really, it's interesting.

295
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And a very personal insight to Yon and everything that's going on with him.

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I hope everything's going well.

297
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yon look forward to more hit tests in the future.

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He does have connectivity now.

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank goodness.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So he's able to hop on Skype and email, etc.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Another thing, flying back on Virgin.

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, it's hard for me to sleep on the plane.

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I used to be able to do much better.

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't know what it is, but I just can't sleep as long or as well as I used to.

305
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think it has something to do with the recline.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The seats just don't recline as far as they used to.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And if they went back just a little bit further would be okay.

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But so I watched a lot of movies.

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Virgin has an excellent in-seat movie system.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It must be 60 movies and television shows.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You can watch all the willing grace episodes from front to back.

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hello.

313
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Ah!

314
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Thank you, Hun.

315
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What's that?

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, I know it's food.

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you.

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, like her.

319
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank you.

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's what do we have?

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Chicken salad.

322
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And...

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's not chicken that's salmon.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And fresh tuna.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Tuna salad.

327
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Thank you.

328
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
See what I mean?

329
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's great to be back home.

330
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, yes.

331
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So I check out a couple movies.

332
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I don't know how often they update them.

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How often they refresh them.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It seems like I've seen most of them, or at least the ones I wanted to see.

335
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So the next trip over, which undoubtedly will be in three weeks from now.

336
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If not even less, I will...

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, yeah.

338
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No, it'll be three weeks from now.

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Because I'm going to nomdex.

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Right.

341
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's the 23rd through 25th of June.

342
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And it's June already.

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How did that happen?

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I watched this movie called Team America.

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know if you've heard of this.

346
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And of course I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

347
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But it's essentially, it's a movie with puppets,

348
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
done with puppets, really on strings.

349
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But it's hard to see how they did it.

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And I'm not on the screen, of course, in the seat back.

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It doesn't make it much easier.

352
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But it's part animated, part puppeteering.

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But it's really, really...

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's a very satirical look at the United States being the police force of the world.

355
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And Hollywood's involvement.

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They have this funny bit where Alec Baldwin is the...

357
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You know, he's going to change the world.

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He's going to, you know, he's leading all actors in Hollywood.

359
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And they're all members of the film Actors Guild.

360
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So everywhere there's this big F-A-G or Fag logo,

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
whenever you see Alec Baldwin.

362
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And there was a lot of irony, a lot of humor in it.

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So it's probably out on DVD.

364
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So I should definitely check that out.

365
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Very, very cool.

366
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And the big news came earlier this week.

367
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
After the French voted no in the referendum

368
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
for ratifying the European Constitution,

369
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the Dutch did the same.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
High turnout almost 70% turnout,

371
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
which is very large for the Netherlands.

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Usually they don't do any better than 35%.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And 63% I believe of the Dutch vote in the referendum,

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
said no, we don't want to ratify the European Constitution.

375
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I've had some time to think about it.

376
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And had some time to read through many different newspapers.

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And it's hard to form an opinion

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
because for every single country,

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think the reasons for voting, whatever they vote, are different.

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
First of all, I think there's a misnomer

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
here in calling it a constitution,

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
where yes, I actually actually look

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
of the definition of constitution.

384
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But you'd expect this kind of like the US constitution.

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And a lot of that stuff is in there.

386
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Freedom's right to work.

387
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And, you know, etc.

388
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Across border, commercialization, trade,

389
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
all those types of things.

390
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But it is a 450-page document.

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And a lot is just very, very difficult to parse.

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And it kind of looks like it's, I think,

393
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
well, let's just call that the main problem.

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think, well, I can only speak for the Netherlands really

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
because I live there for, you know,

396
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the past four and a half, almost five years.

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They did a bad job at explaining to the public

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
what this is and what it's about and what the benefits

399
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
will be or what the potential drawbacks could be.

400
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And I think that the no vote really comes from an incredible

401
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
dissatisfaction from the general populace and the Netherlands

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
about their government.

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The way the Dutch elections, the previous elections

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
worked, the basically the labor party,

405
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
had the most votes.

406
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But they weren't able to form a coalition with other partners.

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So, in effect, they became the opposition

408
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and which is kind of twisted.

409
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You know, the party that had the most votes,

410
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
it's a multiple party system, not to,

411
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
but really they have 10 or a god knows,

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
15 parties it seems like.

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They weren't able to form a large enough coalition.

414
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, the party that the most votes went to is the opposition.

415
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And I think that that really rub the lot of people

416
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the wrong way and that this is much more protest against

417
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
their own government than against

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
the ratification of the constitution.

419
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I really don't think people understand what it is.

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Quite honestly, I don't understand what it is.

421
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I like to be educated before forming an opinion.

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And I've really tried, you know,

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I've gone through this document.

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I've posted a link to it.

425
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'll do it again in the show notes.

426
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You can take a look at it.

427
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's tough, you know.

428
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And it's, I mean, the whole thing becomes

429
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
convoluted just knowing that the European Parliament

430
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
changes locales.

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What does it every month or every couple of weeks?

432
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They go from Brussels to Luxembourg.

433
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then they go, you know, so they have dual offices.

434
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And, you know, who's responsible for what?

435
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's really, really complicated.

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So it's going to be interesting to see what happens now.

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You see the financial times in one second.

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I just think that the financial times

439
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
is what I like to read over here.

440
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Europe and turmoil is the Dutch vote.

441
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No.

442
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Here, massive 62% echo French and rejecting treaty.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So now it's going to be interesting to see what's going to happen.

444
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Sure, rock will probably come out and say something.

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He may step down or it's just tough, you know.

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
In essence, I guess the governments don't have to follow

447
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the advice of the population, what they vote,

448
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
but it seems like they would have to take some kind of note.

449
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And Holland is just angry.

450
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's what I see there.

451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Just really angry about what's what's been happening in their country.

452
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Of course, they blame it on their government.

453
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But at the same time, I have to say,

454
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
this country gets the government it deserves.

455
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And maybe there should have come out

456
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
in more numbers to vote when voting for a government

457
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
instead of this probably reactionary move

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
against the ratification of the constitution.

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But it is kind of interesting to see this little

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
pimple on the ass of Europe, this small country,

461
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
17 million people live there, land mass smaller than Rhode Island.

462
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You know, making a big difference in this whole game.

463
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And it is a game.

464
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That much I know for sure.

465
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hello, everyone.

466
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
This is Madge Weinstein.

467
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Your favorite lesbian on the internet.

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I want to tell you to try my newest

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
channel on the internet.

470
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Like BBC 2, I have a second channel.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And it's called yeast2.com.

472
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And it's different from regular flavoured yeast

473
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
because you get to hear

474
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a mishmosh of different electronic hunt.

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And all kinds of bizarre sounds you get to hear.

476
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Children playing, noise, music,

477
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
freaky, Dutch queens going on and on

478
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
about non-existent pressets.

479
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You get to hear all kinds of very strange things

480
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and best of all.

481
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You, gent audience, can submit your own programs to yeast2.

482
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
As long as they're very weird and hard to stir things.

483
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So, serve to yeast2.com.

484
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay, Madge, as long as they're disturbing.

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And it's not your regularly flavoured yeast.

486
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Another fine line in that promo.

487
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Need more promo.

488
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Send them off.

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm happy to play him.

490
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Not just on the daily source code,

491
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
but on the pod show on serious as well,

492
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
which is doing great.

493
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The feedback is enormous.

494
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And people are really, really getting into it

495
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and starting to send in their own podcast or at least

496
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
recordings and asking how they can set up a podcast.

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And we're going to integrate our production systems

498
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
in the next couple of weeks,

499
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
so that we'll actually be able to take

500
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
ID3 information from promos and podcasts

501
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that we put on pod show and stream them right

502
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
through to the display of the satellite receiver,

503
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
which is a really a big part of what

504
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the information series gives you,

505
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
can't flows through that display.

506
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And I think they have multiple line displays

507
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
on most of the units I've seen.

508
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So, this is, I guess, another plea

509
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
to get better information in the ID3 tags.

510
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I know there's still a lot of confusion about

511
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
what goes where.

512
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I've posted a couple of links to some really good suggestions.

513
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Whatever you do, just please put it in there.

514
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We need that information.

515
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And of course, we're building up a little bit of editorial

516
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
staff so we can add more information.

517
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So when you, you know, if you're driving in your car

518
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and you flip on the pod show on the serious

519
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
148, it's every afternoon between

520
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
6 and 10 Eastern 3 and 7 Pacific,

521
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
you know, that you can, if you fall right in the middle of,

522
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
for instance, or what do we play the other?

523
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, for instance, Mad Weinstein,

524
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
use radio.

525
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
At least the display will give you some context

526
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and some information because, you know,

527
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
unlike the, you know, the radio,

528
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
the radio me where you determine where you want to play

529
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
something on serious, it's all linear.

530
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So it just kind of rolls out, which is a great way to,

531
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you know, just use your driving time to pick up on stuff,

532
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
which is why I like getting a lot of promos

533
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and the more information you can put in the ID

534
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
three tags, the better.

535
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And, and basically, a shorter pod cast

536
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
longer promos, you know, that, that seems to work best.

537
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So send it off to submit at podshow.com

538
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and I'll be happy to drop it into the show.

539
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hello there Adam.

540
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This is Paul Nichols Podcast Paul.

541
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Thanks for playing the promo.

542
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And you can hear up the dance register

543
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
just on my voice.

544
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There are new bands featuring on my new site.

545
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Unsigned UK Music.com.

546
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's pod sake music of the highest session standard quality,

547
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that's specifically hand picked.

548
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm able to try to syndicate as many of these good groups

549
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
as possible around pod cast stations.

550
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And no revenue is made from the site.

551
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This is just to keep glory back

552
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
to some fantastic musicians.

553
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Please check the site out.

554
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Dynamo is with the main series.

555
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Up for the dance track.

556
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Currently figure.

557
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And as I say, you're very welcome

558
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
to download the teaser tracks

559
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and to use them in your podcast.

560
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Thanks very much for checking them out.

561
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thanks again.

562
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's podcast Paul.

563
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
My buddy here in the UK promoting the British pod save you succeed.

564
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Fucking fire wire.

565
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Damn it.

566
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hmm.

567
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Sorry.

568
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh man, that's salmon.

569
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's good.

570
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I love it.

571
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't have to say.

572
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh yeah.

573
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I was interviewed by Rob over at podcast 4011.com.

574
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's an interesting guy.

575
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He gave up his job.

576
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
He quit his job.

577
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And he, as he says, he's leech it off the wife.

578
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Power to you, my brother.

579
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And he's dedicated himself entirely to pod casting.

580
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And he's doing a fantastic job covering.

581
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Everything is going on in pod casting.

582
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Check my podcast 4011.com.

583
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Did an interview with me the other day,

584
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
which he's actually split up in the two parts.

585
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Sounded great.

586
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'll just listen to it.

587
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And it's because of the first time I heard of podcast 4011

588
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
was when he interviewed John Edwards about his podcast,

589
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
which I just saw the latest addition of that come through.

590
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I haven't listened to it yet.

591
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But, and I think he's not also working on getting

592
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
another couple other really big names on his show.

593
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So looking forward to that, something you should definitely

594
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
consider subscribing to.

595
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let's see what else I have.

596
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Well, I think that's pretty much it.

597
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I have a couple more promos and some pod save music.

598
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Let me play one more promo and then we'll get to the music.

599
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm going to get twisted.

600
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Don't be a star, be part of the moment.

601
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't allow you to admit it.

602
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Two brothers across the continent.

603
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
They stood down down.

604
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And you're way over there.

605
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't stop.

606
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That way.

607
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Where do you want?

608
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And the opposite.

609
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What?

610
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Hi Adam.

611
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Did you know that in some tribes in Africa,

612
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
when two men greet each other instead of shaking their hands,

613
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
they shake each other's penises.

614
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Which it splines the origin of the phrase,

615
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
hey Bob, how's it hanging?

616
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What's they got to do with me?

617
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Nothing at all.

618
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But come to my side anyway.

619
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Twist it little gnome.com.

620
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Where a young site.

621
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We're just starting up.

622
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But we already got quite a few little podcast on there.

623
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Come and check us out.

624
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Twist it little gnome.

625
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah.

626
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Daddy.

627
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay.

628
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Snapper Morgan there.

629
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Twisted little.

630
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What is it?

631
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Twisted little gnome?

632
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Did I say that right?

633
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I love it.

634
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Fantastic.

635
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Okay.

636
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So tomorrow, I'll have everything a little bit more together.

637
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm still catching up on email.

638
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah.

639
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We're about at 5,000 unread messages.

640
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
God has driving me nuts.

641
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I just don't want to keep up with it.

642
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
75% now filled with my Gmail allocation.

643
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Two gigabytes.

644
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I believe me.

645
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's not just attachments.

646
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's just, well, it's still a lot of spam.

647
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That comes in waves too.

648
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It really does.

649
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So for the next couple of weeks, I'll be home.

650
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Looking forward to catching up with y'all.

651
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Please.

652
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You know what?

653
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I haven't gotten in a long time.

654
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Some audio feedback.

655
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'd love to have that.

656
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So you can always send that to me at adamatcurry.com.

657
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And again, well, you'll see on the show notes where if you want to submit stuff.

658
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But we're always looking for great pod safe music for mashups.

659
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And of course, the promo's pod safe music now.

660
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This is from a group called Up for the Downstroke.

661
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I love it as feeling side.

662
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Nice and mellow for a Thursday on your source code.

663
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You know where it's true, but you're trying to hide.

664
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You turned that love like a thrilling man.

665
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And you can't give what you never had.

666
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
My flesh's my soul.

667
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You can follow you.

668
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I know the truth.

669
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You can follow me at the bottom.

670
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Being chugged.

671
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Being chugged.

672
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Being chuhled.

673
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Being suction.

674
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You can pretend there's nothing wrong

675
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Girl, I look in your eyes and see you can

676
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So while I stop trying to run behind

677
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You won't bite out if you never try

678
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Girl, I look in your eyes and see you can

679
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So while I stop trying to run behind

680
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You won't bite out if you never try

681
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Girl, I look in your eyes

682
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You won't bite out if you never try

683
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Girl, I look in your eyes and see you can

684
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So while I stop trying to run behind

685
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You won't bite out if you never try

686
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Girl, I look in your eyes and see you can

687
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So while I stop trying to run behind

688
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You won't bite out if you never try

689
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Girl, I look in your eyes and see you can

690
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Girl, I look in your eyes

691
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Girl, I look in your eyes

692
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't know, it's kind of a Donald Fagan vibe too

693
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
On the daily source code, up for the downstroke, it is deep

694
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Feet, I'm sorry, feel inside

695
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's the type, of course, all the information about that in the show notes

696
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And that'll wrap it up for today's source code

697
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
What we do?

698
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
About half an hour, not bad

699
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Again, shorter podcast, longer promo, that's what we're going for

700
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Also, great news about cast blasts are up to beta number

701
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Thirteen already, that means public release coming soon

702
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm going to get back into that

703
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Being on the west coast with basically nine hours

704
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Time difference between

705
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Development team and myself was a little bit complicated

706
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I can't wait to get back into that

707
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
About to load version 13 on the craplet

708
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Give that a whirl, so maybe I'll do tomorrow's source code from

709
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Cast Blaster

710
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And then I got to talk to Mike

711
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Cast Blaster, Mike is we affectionately call him

712
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And see if he's ready to do a wider public release of the first version

713
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I think it'd be very cool, I'm excited

714
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Feet back out of accurry.com

715
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Comments can be left on my weblog www.curry.com

716
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Cast Feed for the show notes and for the archives of the daily source code

717
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Head and over to dailysourcecode.com

718
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Audio feedback is welcome

719
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Still looking for the perfect theme song

720
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And I want one of those that match Weinstein has

721
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I want a song

722
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Adam McCurray.com is the address for that

723
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So tomorrow the thank god of Friday edition

724
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Maybe I'll be able to convince Patricia to do

725
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Another PPP podcast with me this weekend

726
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Which I think will be cool

727
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Place some more of her tunes and have a little fun

728
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Catch up with my wife, you guys can listen in

729
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Thanks for tuning in, thanks for staying subscribed, take care
