1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
Sunday night, May 23rd, 2005, daily source code, it's 104 degrees outside at

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:20,080
quarter to 11, and according to 11, according to 11, quarter to 11, we're in Phoenix.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,160
courtesy of America worst airline.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,960
So we had a, oh, look here it is.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
That's what I'm going to point.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
I told you our friend would hook us up.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
Who would back us up?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
Oh, excuse me.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,240
So we had a flight to get from San Diego to San Francisco.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,720
We had to go via Phoenix, but that was good news because of our meeting.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,200
Well, now I'll talk about that in a second, which we can't talk about.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,560
Yeah, we made it run later, so we had to take the stock to get them a jump flight.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,040
And here's my bag. That's cool.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,080
Thank you. And yours? Yes.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,080
Okay. Oh, boy.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
This bag is about had it though.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,960
See, starting to rip. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, no.

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Well, here. Yeah, I know.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,440
It's time for another $49 bag.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,360
Okay, well, so I did you already call the shuttle.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,840
So basically, America West, we had a connection in Phoenix

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,680
to take a flight to San Francisco and our flight left late.

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
And when we arrived, we sat at the gate for 15 minutes

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,000
because America West had no more people to bring the jet weight to the plane.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Both of their employees were busy.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,360
You sound bitter, Ron. Is it worth that, just?

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,240
You. The nature of the machine. We call it the airline engine.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Right, so.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,360
So, of course, we knew we were going to miss our connecting flight.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,840
And it was, you left out the port. It wasn't even listed.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,880
It couldn't find the gate for it. I'm getting there. Come on.

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
Well, no, it's starting to work on the plane.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,840
And we're waiting for 15 minutes and then the, what do you call them?

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Flight attendant, the person says, hey, if anyone wants to ride a letter to

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,440
our company, go ahead. Sorry about your bad idea. If you want to ride a letter to somebody.

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
Yeah. Feel free. So,

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,480
oh, check this out. Now, we're going to go out the door. I do 104 degrees at 11 o'clock at night.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,640
Yeah, that's rough. So, there was no one to eat us. No one telling us where to go.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
All the screens show the morning flights.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,800
So, while Ron tried to get us free boat for the morning, I went to try and get our bags

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
for three from the tarmac because they actually hadn't even been brought in yet.

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,760
And so, let's see, it's been about two hours that we've been hanging out here.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,160
The thing is, it's fine to get everything square in the way. Now, we should be having our bags with us.

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,640
And with any luck, we're going to shovel them.

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,760
Who, uh, I think it was Coach Elbach, which was very nice.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
And the next flight out is 7 a.m.

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,680
From our morning.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
So, we'll still be able to make our

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,160
That was just going to eat us with some reasonable time for it.

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,480
I think what I'll do is, uh, they will continue this when we're in a little bit quieter environment.

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
We do some kind of cool stuff we've talked about.

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,840
wand

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,560
They're opening up.

54
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,120
It's really noisy out here.

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,120
I think I'm part of the old travelers, yeah, I'm really concerned about my bag now.

56
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
But you know the next guy that picks this up is gonna rip open.

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Yeah, that's a ticket.

58
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
I don't know, I'll shove this down.

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
It's classic.

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
We'll just take it.

61
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Yeah.

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Okay.

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Okay.

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,120
So, I'll stop this and we'll continue with where to buy our environment.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't go anywhere, y'all.

66
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay.

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
We are not waiting for them.

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Don't know, don't grab it by that.

69
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Get this one in.

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:58,120
You're not drinking with those, isn't it?

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
No, I'm a van coming right here.

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Coming.

73
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Okay.

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Okay.

75
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
So, we've opted for the cat.

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Oh, that's too much wind.

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Okay.

78
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
All righty.

79
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
How are you doing?

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Good.

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Feels nice.

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Airport Hills.

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I know it's close.

84
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm gonna hook you up.

85
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Put your money away for the van.

86
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Don't worry.

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Don't even turn on your meter.

88
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I'll hook you up.

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Fair enough?

90
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Yeah.

91
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Okay, okay.

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I know it's right near here, right?

93
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Watch it be 20 feet.

94
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay.

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,120
So, uh, I actually had a pretty good day.

96
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Which is the humorous day in 4-E-7.

97
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
4-E-7.

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Right?

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,120
It's the one that's closest to the airport.

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Yeah.

101
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,120
We, uh, caught up this morning.

102
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,120
I had a nice, really nice sleep.

103
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I like 8-4 hours.

104
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
I hate to clock my eyes.

105
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I just went bleeding and opened.

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,120
And, uh, had some breakfast.

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Had a guy come up to a breakfast.

108
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
That's right.

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
To hell with my weight here last night.

110
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I heard your pocket.

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Oh, there was at this morning.

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
I heard your backpack.

113
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Yeah.

114
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Yeah.

115
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Yeah.

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Yeah.

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
That was kind of cool.

118
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
It was interesting guy here.

119
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
It was in the automotive industry.

120
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
He ended up in engineering team.

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Yeah.

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,120
He's trying to get, uh, iPod and M.D.3 player hookups in cars.

123
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,120
He says 2007.

124
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,120
It's crazy.

125
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:15,120
And, uh, then we hang out for a little bit.

126
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
So tired.

127
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
I'll tell you what.

128
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
What is that over there?

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
You see all those red lights?

130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Or is that just 50 end of runway?

131
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
The end of Area 52.

132
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I don't know what it is.

133
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,120
I haven't been to Phoenix on in years.

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
I came here to, uh,

135
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,120
go to the Bob Bondoron School of Racing.

136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
With, uh,

137
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah, those two.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
That was one MTV still that cool shit.

139
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,120
We, uh, we got the celebrity racing Denver.

140
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,120
And all of us had to be qualified.

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
So it's like,

142
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,120
the guys from Motley Crew,

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
White Lion.

144
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
And, uh,

145
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Johnny Gill.

146
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Some reason I remember him.

147
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,120
And we spent like four days here getting our license to race.

148
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
And, uh,

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
And, I already live in Dijk, Dutch sky.

150
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
It lives out here.

151
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Which is Dijk?

152
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I already live in Dijk.

153
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I already live in Dijk.

154
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I already live in Dijk.

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
He, uh,

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
1 Indy, uh,

157
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
3 times I think now.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Or 2 times.

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
2 or 3 times.

160
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Hey, gentleman.

161
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Splub.

162
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Triple X of Delta Action.

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Can't believe we passed that.

164
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,120
and find a planning neighborhood, it's located next to the collisions and not sure what

165
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,320
it looks like. I'm sorry I didn't start recording when I went to the Bagged Resolution

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Center. That was pretty cool. Okay. So the highlight of the day was without a doubt

167
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:19,960
about an hour and a half that we had with Steve Jobs, which was really fun. You know,

168
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:30,640
just a private conversation. And that was great. And of course I can't tell you everything

169
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,960
but only for us about now. Of course we need to turn this off. But I will say that I was

170
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:43,520
able to provide a lot of input. The number one great piece of input that I was able

171
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,240
to feedback was, hey, I want to record on my iPod. And I can guarantee you that's going

172
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,480
to happen sometime in the near future. Okay. So we're going to find our hotel sleep and

173
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,880
then tomorrow sometime in the afternoon. Hopefully I'll be able to bring you a longer

174
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,080
daily source code with all the usual stuff. Because we're just about ready to pull

175
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,480
up to the what do we at the waffle house? The awful house. We should know that if you're
