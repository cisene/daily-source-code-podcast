1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Delta Sierra Charley, scrunch grunch, 2-8-0.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Transmitters?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't need nuss.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thinking turns me in.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I like to think I'm flying into the shunt.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Fantastic.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's Adam Curry.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Man, my mixer is all scrunchy.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hold on, there we go.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, no more cracks.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Crackling.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey, welcome to Seattle, Washington.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm here at the Western Hotel.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is...

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's Tuesday, the 15th of November, 2005.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And it is high noon.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I had a very short night and a very busy morning.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I have about an hour before I have to go to the airport to fly back to San Francisco.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Whether a willing, of course, if there's one thing I hate about Seattle, it's the ground fog.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And not just Seattle, but also San Francisco.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I think the on-time chances of a flight is like 20% or something.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So hopefully I'll get out of my 3-20 flight, 3-21.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So let me bring you up to speed.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Apologies about lack of a source code yesterday, but since I've done two over the week,

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've figured you'd have enough to listen to and a lot of people like to catch up

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and sometimes it's hard if you're doing seven days a week.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Witness Dawn and Drew, I've heard their listeners talk about that, but actually they do listen every single one.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, let me see what I'm going to say.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Alright, so I didn't do a show yesterday because I wanted to have some time in the office to hang out with everybody

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and it's been a couple of weeks since I was gone and check up on stuff and look over everybody's shoulder

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and be obnoxious as usual.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Rushed off to the airport with the Pod Pamp, Aaron Bersel, to Seattle, got in last night.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is a brand new hotel, by the way.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This, this Western, I think I'm on the, was the 14th floor.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think about floor 20, they're probably still completing it.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They're still putting inside walk out front and it's funny because the room has almost everything,

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but the coffee machine, I don't even know if the room has been used yet, the coffee machine, the coffee maker,

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
not a stencil, was, it still had the original wire ties, the cable ties on the electric lead,

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
so it wasn't plugged in, so it seems like it hasn't been used at all.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the reason for being here, as I think I told you in a previous show, is to meet with,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
or actually to present in front of 300 brand managers and media buyers of the Johnson & Johnson company,

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
which is just unbelievably huge.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me see, I think I actually have a list of the stuff that these guys make.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I had no idea some of this stuff, I got, this is going to be a Gmail show, by the way.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oops, tab, I need my caps locked there.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Since I really didn't have any time to prep, we'll just go through some Gmail and play some stuff

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that I have collected throughout the day.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let me see, I'm looking for the products.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I just did something really cool, by the way.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I needed to get Patricia's passport, a copy of her passport, to send off to a lawyer in the Netherlands.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And, you know, I don't think she's ever done any scanning, here's the J&J products.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't think she's ever done any scanning on the computer at home at the cottage.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So what I did is I have a VNC, watch that, so I have my airports set up at home,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
so I could basically SSH into the iMac at the cottage.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then I set up, because you have to kind of direct the ports on the router,

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
so that it knows which machine to talk to for certain protocols or basically for all protocols.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then I fired up VNC, then on this end, here in Seattle, I used chicken of VNC, opened up,

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
so I could see the machine there, I could control it, opened up another terminal window on that machine,

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
on the local network, and SSH into the desktop machine that Patricia's on,

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
as her, of course, and then fired up VNC again.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So I was actually able to create the entire scan and email the result to me,

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
while sitting here, controlling her computer.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The only thing she had to do was actually put the passport on the top of the scanner,

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or the absolute amazing.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, here we go.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Johnson, Johnson products.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Of course, Johnson, baby care products, Nutrigina, OB, stay free, care free, bandaid,

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
adhesive managers, KY, monitor stat, Tylenol, motrin, pepsid,

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
ammonium, malanta, splenda, benacol, lactate, all kinds of shit for your gastronomic

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
issues.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And then they have a huge pharmaceuticals division.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't recognize any of these luckily, but they have something for a hyperactivity disorder,

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
migraines, hormonal contraceptive, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease, anti-anemic

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
with indications for oncology, HIV, just like cancer and AIDS drugs.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then they have active U-life scan, cordus, ethan,

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
active U, by the way, is already working on a plan.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They've got a podcast coming out, which is completely underwritten by active U, two girls.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know what?

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That'll be kind of cool.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll play that for you here.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Heather and John L.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The show isn't available yet, but they've done their, they're what I call imaging,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
they're all kind of their sound effects and stuff.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They've got all that done.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And these are two girls that were recruited specifically for the show, which is kind

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
of interesting.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And they cut a promo for me to play at this Johnson and Johnson hold down.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So imagine me, on stage, I'm like a little Steve Jobs.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
As Madge would say, I had my pants pulled up to my vagina.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then I played.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Eating Johnson and Johnson, how y'all doing there in Seattle,

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
bet you drink lots of really strong coffee right now.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is Heather and Janelle and New York.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So how's it going at your big global media summit?

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just how global, isn't anyway.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, is Antartica there?

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is Bali there?

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I hear Adam Curry, the pod father is there.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, he's sort of global and pretty hot, well for an older guy.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Not to get too much time away from your important PowerPoint presentations and fancy sandwich lunches.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We just wanted to give a shout out to our awesome sponsor, Acvew.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's called a call to action.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We'll be talking about lots of important stuff.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Boys, clothes, music.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And all guys.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Boys.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Talk about some old guy.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you really care if they listen?

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They are not.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Our target market.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
True.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then tell your kids.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Tell your kids to tune in.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Download.acvew.com.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's called viral marketing.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No back to your regularly scheduled conference.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
See ya.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So you can imagine I got, I got some laughs with that and some other stuff.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was great.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It was, it was unfortunate because Judy McGrath, who is the president CEO of MTV Networks,

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
also presented this conference.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She did it yesterday.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
She did the keynote.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And I had the keynote this morning.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She wasn't there.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But I did hook up with Mark Rosenthall who, of course, ran MTV Networks for a number of years.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And he's now the chairman and CEO of Interpublic.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So I got to tell ya.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,500
Whole bunch of people who were really, really interested and excited about, particularly

145
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
about the creativity of what can be done here.

146
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
So I was very, very bullish on that.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was great.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I was done.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And last question, you know, like 50 minute, 500, 50 minutes into the, into this.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So once I said, what about subliminal advertising?

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh man.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I ripped into them.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That was so cool.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I did the wholesale thing with the burping.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It was, it was, it was, it was really, it was a lot of fun.

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So even though I usually hate doing things like this, this one worked out okay.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hey, yes, my favorite song of the day.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Candy Butchers.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What to do with Michael?

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They met in Paris in 94.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, was it 95?

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She was bestying abroad.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He was on tour.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Playing in another time.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They potted hard and they potted wings.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A little north of the sand.

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He dreamed about her in so many ways.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
She dreamed about her in France.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, she knows what to do with Michael.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
She knows how to make him feel.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That is the one.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He's his mother son.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Not like anyone.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It just needs time to heal.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They met in New York a few months later.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He was still living alone.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hugging the ball and masturbating.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Never answers.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Fun.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Never's date.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Was a movie together.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Outside of Brian Park.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, the spirit I've seen the week just went off forever.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Until they drank one.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Till they saw stars.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, she knows what to do with Michael.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She knows how to make him feel.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That is the one.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He's his mother son.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Not like anyone.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It just needs time to heal.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They finally hooked up for the first time.

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The night before the fourth of July.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He felt so awkward saying goodbye to the girl.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just changed his life.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Now my friend, they are in separate ball.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She even gets that boy to go to the gym.

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now if you don't think that's love, you must be cynical.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, make a man.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're just dreaming in friends.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, because he knows what to do with Michael.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She knows how to make him feel.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, that is the one.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He's his mother son.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Not like anyone.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It just needs time to heal.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, she knows what to do with Michael.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
She knows how to make him feel.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That is the one.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He's mother son.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Not like anyone.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It just needs time to heal.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, he's the one.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He's his mother son.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Not like anyone.

216
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It just needs time to heal.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, that's right.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He just needs time to heal.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, I love this song.

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Candy Butcher is what to do with Michael from Hang on Mike.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Pot say, although not yet, on the Pot say, the music network.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I do have permission to play it.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I got a really nice email from from some folks who work with the

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
band.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And working on getting that on the Pot say music network.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And cheese Louise.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There is Michael Butler is now, you know, rock and old geek.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The rock and old geek show is now responsible for a lot of what's coming into the Pot say music network.

229
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This guy.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He just signed up an epita record.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think which includes Merrill, Merrill,

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Haggard and dude is just he's going to send me a whole list.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Actually, he did send me a list, but I haven't.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Processed yet.

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want to tell you about some of the great artists that are coming into the Pot say music network.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Some established names.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it's great, you know, because as long as they own their masters,

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
they can decide if they want to, you know,

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
give up the one time or wave any fees for the right for podcasters to play their tombs.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You know, it's great.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So you can get that Candy Butcher song off of iTunes.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The whole album is really great.

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Really is.

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Speaking of that Matthew evil, you know,

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've played his top down driving around song.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's a drive away, I think it is.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And a couple of times on the show.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And he sent me his new CD.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And he said, you know, or he sent me a CD.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So I'm really looking for some thoughts on what the next single should be.

251
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You know, what, what should I start promoting?

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So I said, no, I'd have it.

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I have a listen and then he emailed me like half an hour later.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And he said, I can't believe I'm taking CD track advice from a guy who

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
he's in a bottle at 5,000 feet.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And you guys really like that.

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's pretty interesting.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't expect you would hold on to have a note here about the Candy Butcher.

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let me see what this is one second.

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey Adam, real quick note on the Candy Butcher.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I did the same thing.

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I heard a one accident hash, loved him.

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Turn around went to iTunes, bought the album.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then when preparing for my next show,

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
one of the pot safe music network and looked for them.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Couldn't find them.

267
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So he emailed CC and caught him right before he left for the expo.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And he said that they were not on the PMN yet.

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And he encouraged me to email them.

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let them know that I had heard them on accident hash.

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Try to convince in this podcasting thing.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Really is working that it really will give them exposure.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So just wanted to share that.

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So maybe you can pass on the word to your listeners.

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That we need to do that for all these artists.

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let them know that we're hearing them on podcasting.

277
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let them know that it does work.

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It will increase our record sales.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And this is the way to go.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I just wanted to share that with you real quick.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you very much.

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Bye bye.

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yo.

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's PD love from Love House radio.

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Cool, dude.

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Thank you very much.

287
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We got to keep moving him because he is a working.

288
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, this is another thing I received through through Gmail.

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I love this one.

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is so great.

291
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Check this out.

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey Adam.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is Eric Skip from the Glitchcast,

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
where I feature great independent artists

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and encourage them to bring their music to the pot safe music network.

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was listening to commercial radio

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to get a feel for what our competition is doing.

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I heard something that I think you just have to hear yourself.

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I think you might recognize the voice.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Tonight we've got a very special.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Long distance dedication.

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Going out from the radio industry to one Mr. Adam Curry.

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It reads.

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Dear Adam, we know it's been a long time since we talked.

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But there's just a few things we wanted to get off our chest.

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We've heard what you're doing.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And frankly, we just don't get it.

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Who the heck are these artists you're playing?

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We hear they're not even paying you to play their songs.

310
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Second, we really wish you'd cut out all the cussing

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and blathering on about your life.

312
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It gives our DJ's ideas and they've got songs to play.

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Listen Adam, we'll cut you a deal.

314
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If you come back to us and bring your listeners,

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
we'll loosen up the rules a little bit.

316
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Love.

317
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Commercial radio.

318
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, I tell you what commercial radio.

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't think Adam's coming back.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But here's that long distance dedication anyway.

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is Bruce Cox,

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
with what the fuck's a podcast.

323
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We're on it.

324
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We'll get it.

325
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're with us now.

326
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Ready?

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What's the podcast?

328
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Do this?

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's great.

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Adam, we'll just come.

331
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's go.

332
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You feel you.

333
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's all it's done.

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Adam, we're in the zone.

335
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Come here.

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Some of the best independent music on the pop-sake music network.

337
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The glitchcast.

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
GlitchNYC.com slash glitchcast.

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I love it when everyone starts working together.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think I got the complete music track from cruise box to do that.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So I'm just going to run through some Gmail stuff.

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
All this is so good.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You guys have been sending amazing stuff from TQ White.

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The second two minutes about DRM,

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the language of the RIA and the characteristics of a good file format.

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay.

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll bite.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Let's see what he's got going on.

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Two minutes.

350
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's worth the investment.

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
My name is TQ White.

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I run a weblog called just kidding.com.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I'm a big fan of your stuff.

354
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you.

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This morning I was listening to your discussion of the audible DRM announcement.

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And you said something that for the first time I can remember,

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
jolted my conceptual consistency with your viewpoint.

358
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I know that as an unreconstructed hippie a few years older than you,

359
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
we share a lot of concepts and shall we say practices.

360
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It came when you were considering the goods and bads of digital rights management.

361
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You said that something to the extent that DRM was disliked

362
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
because it prevented people from stealing music.

363
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Though I totally understand that you weren't making any point about that,

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I want to caution you here.

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't believe it's stealing.

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Lots of people don't think it's stealing.

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm opposed to digital rights management because it prevents information from flowing freely.

368
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I love the MP3 because it can be universally accepted and used.

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can receive, send, share, use.

370
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The information contained in them without restriction.

371
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I won't bore you with a long rant about my political theory against intellectual property,

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but there are lots of people out there that don't believe it's stealing to share music.

373
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That said, I like you, lot of musicians, programmers, writers, and all the other information producers

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
to be rewarded.

375
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I just don't want to be coerced with either technical or legal means.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I pirate everything and pay for the stuff that I like and use.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So what's this mean to you?

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't join the RIA in using the language of crime to refer to the issues involved in DRM.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't accuse me of theft.

380
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Though I personally don't believe that it can be made to work with anything less freely usable than an MP3,

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I could get behind a data format that supported additional features, tracking and so on,

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
including the built-in ability for me to easily choose to send money to the author.

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Formats like audibles.AA that include digital right restriction features will never be played on my computer ever,

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and I don't believe that they'll succeed in the big picture.

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Anyway, keep up the good work.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I think you're doing a great job.

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Best regards.

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
TQ White.

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hey, TQ, that's great.

390
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You hear my fan kicking out on the, oh, that was your fan on your power book.

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Wow, that was a mind-fuck.

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay, so that's very interesting.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And I really appreciate the fact that you pointed out that you would be open to talking about a file format

394
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that allows some reporting.

395
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay, that's good.

396
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I had a mini epiphany last night, well here in the hotel.

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I was thinking, now, because we can still kind of mess around with the pod safe music network before it gets, you know,

398
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
too big and too many people are in there and you can't really reverse engineer anything.

399
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What if we gave the option?

400
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So the pod safe music network, if you register as a pod cast, you can actually download the full MP3 tracks and then play the money pod cast.

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
As a listener, you can listen to any song in the pod safe music network right from your computer by clicking on the on little play button.

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So what if we enabled the pod safe music network so that the artists could enable a track to be purchased?

403
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Which, and the simplicity of this really really hit me right between the years last night.

404
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
First of all, it's real easy to create, you know, a transaction e-commerce engine like that is easy.

405
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So you pay money.

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm thinking 50 cents, right?

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's undercut iTunes just to make the experiment interesting.

408
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And then any artist who's willing to participate in the experiment could just check a box next to a track that they would like to make purchaseable.

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So what that means is as a listener, you would download essentially the same track that the pod cast or downloads and gets for free.

410
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But of course, it's trade off because the pod cast or plays it on his or her pod cast.

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then you pay your 50 cents and that goes to the artist.

412
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And it's a clear, clean MP3 file.

413
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think that this would be a really interesting experiment because if it's really true that we pay for the stuff we like and we're not thieves.

414
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And of course, I'm not a thief.

415
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So I think I'm much closer to you, TQ in your philosophy than you might imagine.

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Then we should probably be able to make some good money for these artists.

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
As long as you make it really simple because I think that's the beauty of iTunes is it's dadadly simple.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And they even keep your credit card information so you can purchase at will, which is great.

419
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And there's a 50 cents, you know, it's a pain in the ass to pull it out your credit cards.

420
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Maybe just register once and then you couldn't buy any track you want.

421
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And our success will prove if it's worth it or not because we'll know how many times something is played.

422
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We can see sales results, the artists will have all this information and they can then base their future purchasing habits based upon that wouldn't be interesting.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Wouldn't it be really, really interesting if it turned out that sales were astronomical within our little world, of course.

424
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We don't have JLo's yet, but that's soon to come because these podcasts are proliferating.

425
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's a lot of propagation of cool tunes out there.

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Wouldn't that be really interesting? Wouldn't that just break a whole bunch of business models?

427
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It could break DRM.

428
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So maybe we say the only DRM we believe in is don't rob musicians.

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's probably a good one. I want to try that out.

430
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think it will work. I, you know what? My belief in humanity tells me it's going to work.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Hey Adam says Chris Copeland.

432
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
At first I bulked at the enormity of the download for DSC279.

433
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
At first it was the pure size 101 megabytes.

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah, then the bit rate, 192K that had me thinking you would flubbed it and send it out at higher than need be.

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, I'll be honest with you Chris. Yeah, I did flub it.

436
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was my mistake, but I noticed it because I was like, wow, this upload is taking a long time.

437
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And that's 100 megs. What's that? That makes no sense.

438
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But I was already well committed in halfway through it, so I figured out whatever.

439
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
In fact, I actually thought listening to the, to the file that maybe no one want to listen to it.

440
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But I felt it would probably be a good idea or it wasn't bad that it was uploaded at such a high bit rate

441
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
because you'd get better audio than at a lower bit rate, of course.

442
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The audio was already quite, you know, crappy with basically the intercom system in the plane.

443
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So Chris Copeland said, I was wrong.

444
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
With the audio pipe through my cars, JBLs, I felt like I was right there with you in the plane.

445
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The rumble of the engine caused my interior to vibrate and me with it.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Wow, that's hot.

447
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The theater drew me away from the daily traffic to a plane over California as it made its way.

448
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The higher bit rate was worth it to have a full range of audio and be able to hear the conversation,

449
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the radio chatter and almost feel the turbulence right along with you guys.

450
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Thank you for taking me for the ride, Chris Copeland.

451
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Very cool, dude.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's excellent.

453
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Thank you.

454
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Some more feedback on that.

455
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Damn you, Adam, says Tom Martinek.

456
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There I was sitting in traffic thinking,

457
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
bad, I had to pee.

458
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And you start talking about needed to go like a racer horse.

459
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then you get a bottle and start letting loose,

460
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
listening to you,

461
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
get some much needed relief was maddening as I sat there on my car with my legs crossed.

462
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Have you ever tried to drive with your legs crossed?

463
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's not easy.

464
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Damn you.

465
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Damn you to hell.

466
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And have a nice day.

467
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Says Tom.

468
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Fantastic.

469
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Let me see.

470
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Enjoyed the plane.

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm telling you this, it was really quite amazing to see how many people really enjoyed it.

472
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He felt like I was up there flying with you.

473
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He's no more peeing on DSC, says Cade.

474
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
When you describe your peeing experience,

475
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I suddenly had to go real bad.

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I couldn't imagine you having to cut the flow in the middle of either.

477
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Now that was messed up.

478
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let me tell you.

479
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That was no fun.

480
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Audio feedback.

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay.

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let's, if it's too long or for the,

483
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
this is actually the way that I,

484
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
that I go through promos and feedback is by,

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
basically listening to him and if they bore me,

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
then they go on the,

487
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

488
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And this is Angie B.

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I love spirals.

490
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
We're on the Podsafe Music Network.

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I've ever wanted to give you some feedback regarding the whole BMI

492
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
ASCAP issue,

493
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
which you just brought up again recently this weekend.

494
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We're an indie band that was signed to a small label for the past 15 years.

495
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
We sold a little over 50,000 CDs.

496
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So while we're not totally unknown,

497
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
we're by no means a major label artist.

498
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In fact, we recently began our own label

499
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and we just put out a first self release CD this month.

500
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Now I've been hearing about the Creative Commons copyright quite a bit over the past few years.

501
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And I wondered if we should go that route with our new music.

502
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But the thing is that the BMI actually does collect and send us money.

503
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Of course, radio play for smaller bands.

504
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It doesn't really bring in any significant money.

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But if you're lucky enough to land placement in a popular TV show or commercial,

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
then BMI or ASCAP can bring in hundreds of dollars per check,

507
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
which is really great for smaller bands.

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I noticed recently that pump audio, one of the companies we worked with,

509
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
has been advertising on Garage Band.

510
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And Garage Band is hooking up independent bands with Creative Commons.

511
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So I'm assuming that a lot of independent artists working with Creative Commons

512
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
are now starting to license their music on TV.

513
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So my question to you is,

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
how can bands that are in a position to make a little bit of money like this?

515
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Really afford to give up working with BMI or ASCAP.

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I mean Creative Commons doesn't collect money, period.

517
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean, I honestly feel stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.

518
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
On the one hand, being a smaller band, we really need the support of podcasters.

519
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We're more than any major label band does.

520
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But on the other hand, we need to try to collect any money that comes our way.

521
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Even if it is through BMI, because as you said, creative people,

522
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
such as bands and podcasters really kind of need to quit their day jobs,

523
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
so we can continue to be more creative.

524
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Just to try to help out in this dilemma,

525
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I decided last week to update our website to include an official statement about podcasting,

526
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
along with the free downloads that we provide.

527
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So there's a public record of our permission.

528
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Maybe other bands listen to your show should consider doing something like that too.

529
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And by the way, our website is lovesparals.com.

530
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We've got the free MP3s I mentioned, as well as our podcast.

531
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Chillin' with love spirals.

532
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So come check us out if you haven't already.

533
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay.

534
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
First of all, you got a hell of a sexy voice.

535
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Let me check you out on the website.

536
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Love spirals.com.

537
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Let me see loading pictures.

538
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh, he's so cute.

539
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I got to twist my head all the way to the right to see you.

540
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
He he.

541
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
All right.

542
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So of course, you confuse me with a lawyer, which is unfortunate.

543
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I have actually looked into this.

544
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And it's a lot simpler than you'd think.

545
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So ask cap and BMI.

546
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
They are collection agencies.

547
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And they collect money from more than just the broadcast industry by the way.

548
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
They collected from bars, from elevators, hotels, and even from businesses.

549
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If you have a business and let's say you have a mechanic shop, a garage.

550
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And you have the radio on.

551
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You will eventually get a visit from Ask Cap and or BMI.

552
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm not quite sure who drops by.

553
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Maybe they both drop by.

554
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And they'll start asking you about who you listen to.

555
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
How often, how many people listen to it.

556
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And you have to pay money for that.

557
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So the groovy thing is you own all of your stuff.

558
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I presume.

559
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So it's all yours.

560
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So you can license this.

561
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Anyway, you want to anybody in any manner.

562
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So signing up with Ask Cap BMI is not a license.

563
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That is a, it's basically, you copyright your work with the US copyright office.

564
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
All that information is on the BMI and Ask Cap websites, by the way.

565
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I think costs 35 bucks and doesn't matter.

566
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You can send like 10 tracks at once and it only costs 35 dollars.

567
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And you copyright it.

568
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So that is your work.

569
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And then you sign up with Ask Cap BMI.

570
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I don't think, one of them doesn't have a fee, I think.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But so anyway, you sign up.

572
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And then you're in their database.

573
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And whenever your name pops up for an air play either on radio or TV or, you know,

574
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and then of course they have these huge complicated structures.

575
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, we're figuring that if you were played three times on a radio station,

576
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
you might have hit an elevator once or something.

577
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I don't know how they do it.

578
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's all mumbo, jumbo.

579
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
They try to explain it.

580
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
They will then send you a check.

581
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So when you register with the pod safe music network at music.podshow.com,

582
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
you're basically handing out a different license to a different set of people.

583
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The podcasters, essentially by clicking OK, sign that agreement and agree to,

584
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
to the terms as set out in, in the terms at the PMN.

585
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So that doesn't mean, and in fact,

586
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it states there that it's yours and that no performance license or royalty or anything

587
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
will have to be paid.

588
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And that's a license only to those people who are a member of the pod safe music network.

589
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's really simple.

590
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So you could license it anyway you want with any terms you want to anybody.

591
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Now, as it, I'm not, again, I'm not a lawyer,

592
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and you should really talk to Larry Lessick about the creative common stuff.

593
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But I'm pretty sure that if you put it up under creative commons,

594
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
that you can still license it to ask happened BMI.

595
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It shouldn't be a problem.

596
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
In fact, I encourage that because if your music is used in that manner,

597
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
in a broadcast or public performance, then of course you should get compensated.

598
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Now, when it comes to TV shows, that's a little different because that's a synchronization fee or a sync right.

599
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And I think you can basically call the shots on that.

600
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Because they will have to contact you.

601
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They would use it for a commercial.

602
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And again, I'm not a lawyer, so I could have this wrong.

603
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But I think that, you know, look, the basis of everything is that it's your stuff.

604
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And if you want to license it to me for free and to ABC for $10,000,

605
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
that's up to you.

606
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That is up to you.

607
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I encourage it.

608
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And I'm really, really happy you sent me that email.

609
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I really appreciate it.

610
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You guys would like to try out the experiment with the free and clear MP3 for purchase.

611
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Wouldn't that be interesting?

612
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Gosh, I really want to check that out.

613
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay, I think I'm about ready for some more songs.

614
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Let me just go through some more Gmail here.

615
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
See what I can find.

616
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hi, good people of Pod Show.

617
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Man, I'm just looking for some, for some action here.

618
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I tag everything with the, not yet another comment about what is about the expo

619
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and Pod Safe Music from James B.

620
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Okay, James B, I'll bite.

621
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's see what you got cooking here.

622
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I have to look it up, transferring data.

623
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Just playing quick time.

624
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I ask this is James from JamesB.com producer of Navalcast.

625
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, of course.

626
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm just getting home from the portable media expo and wanted to send you a comment.

627
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The expo was great.

628
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
My wife and I enjoyed it very much.

629
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
My wife who is an elementary school teacher commented that she had never been to a conference,

630
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
where there was a line to the men's restroom, but not to the women's.

631
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Hopefully next year there's enough women podcasters that they have to stand in line as well.

632
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's unfortunate that I didn't get to meet you, but I met a lot of friendly fellow podcasters.

633
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Regarding the recent talk about Pod Safe Music, one of the messages I took away from the conference,

634
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
is an understanding that there's no good way to play R.I.W.A. licensed music.

635
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
With that in mind, I too am changing my show format to be entirely pod safe.

636
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
My past episodes have featured clips of licensed music to punctuate the stories I tell.

637
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll be editing them to make my past episodes pod safe.

638
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I commend you and PW for your move to pod safe music and encourage other podcasters to do the same.

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
In addition, like PW indicated in his most recent digital flotsom,

640
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I am going to do my part to support pod safe artists by only buying music from those that support pod safe music.

641
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Why spend our time and money on an industry that is held bent on suing their customers?

642
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
When we have talented artists that are willing to work with us, thanks talk to you later.

643
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Dude, thank you very much.

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
While you were talking, I was going into my playlist here at the pod safe music network,

645
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:06,000
where I was, for instance, I was listening to pod show music rewind episode number eight from the pool side at the expo.

646
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It was funny.

647
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Guys, they're a riot man.

648
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Brother love dropping by, big mayhem.

649
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It just sounded so good.

650
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You know, I've learned and we did a lot of stuff at the expo.

651
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We had mad running around, Dawn and Drew did at least one show,

652
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
a magic, a million shows, I did a show, a Michael Butler did a show,

653
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
almost every one of the pod safe music network did something,

654
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
if not together, then they did it individually.

655
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And I've learned that even though the content sometimes,

656
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
certainly the mad stuff was a bit over the top to say the least,

657
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
but just looking at it, you kind of did get the feeling,

658
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
oh man, I wish I could be there, and I heard a lot of that from people,

659
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
so that to me usually means that we did a good job at making some of the expo come alive

660
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
of those pretty cool.

661
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Okay, so here's the song that I heard on the pod safe music network,

662
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
where the hell would it go?

663
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh, don't you hate it when that happens?

664
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm here like, I'm staring at my desktop and can't find it.

665
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay, let's go window, no tools, downloads.

666
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
No, it should, I could just click open, there we go.

667
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
This is, okay, this is from Epita Records, I guess,

668
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
so this is one of the one of those cool bands that have been added to the PMN.

669
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This is Danger Doom and Mint's Meat.

670
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The villain ain't crumbin' off credit alone.

671
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Then I'm getting some cognac, I might kinda head for,

672
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
smoke the mirrors, call her in the mince,

673
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
couldn't read the shorthand, the mortars and bricks.

674
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If any negative thought lingers, he netted that,

675
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
wrote this one with his middle finger and wet the cement.

676
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Did it on the side, before he's gone by by spit it on the fly,

677
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
brush your teeth, rinse and garble,

678
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
a true nerd that's put in words since garble,

679
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and you flang and scrabble,

680
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
brine with the northern jaw, twang and babble,

681
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
glossy penjar, didn't break the world record,

682
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
through a forest in bargain and take the girl naked.

683
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
More spots than a leopard,

684
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Jenny had to stop the block with hot pepper,

685
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
shepherd, leading sheep's out to slaughter,

686
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
kept it sold and wrapped it, every time he saw ya,

687
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
trying to doubt some pinch of weed in a frat street house.

688
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I only links me out of that beat, mouse.

689
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Welcome to the show, remember whatever you do,

690
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
do not pull the flow, school the dumb on the number one,

691
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
what a fool.

692
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's too never met a cooler bum,

693
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
keep the drummer's from,

694
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
enjoy keeping the shot,

695
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
just to get his shoes high,

696
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
surely only as it's fine.

697
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
A stranger who speaks to you,

698
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
vocal, danger made the beat get up for it to do the vocal.

699
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
No bull, everything we wanted they grabbed him took,

700
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
whole lab look like an ill left jabbing hook,

701
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
even had a secretary to take the balls,

702
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
shake it and make it fall,

703
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I told her, don't break my balls,

704
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
whatever mouse gold trouble follows,

705
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the bouncing on his throw was kills,

706
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and double dollars,

707
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
fills pill bottle flows,

708
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
that before the scholars,

709
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
thick bluff a little girl,

710
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the bubble hollers,

711
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
he's rock lathering gold,

712
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
a fat blouse,

713
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and neither brother was sold to let her back out,

714
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
even if the rat couldn't compete with crowds.

715
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I make me scream out of that beat, mouse.

716
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Tap your toe,

717
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
crime and strap,

718
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
a dope rat for show,

719
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
to let the whipper snappers know,

720
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
sucks to read him,

721
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
now pass that loop,

722
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
up under the ducts,

723
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
you or a hazmat suit,

724
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
sound to light Friday,

725
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
so the radius of potions,

726
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
be up in the party with the fiveiest emotions,

727
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
on the list of lobbies,

728
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
for save the oceans,

729
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
gave his donation

730
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
to the lady with the lotions,

731
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
swole hand kitchen,

732
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
the old man bitch,

733
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and switching with the fan,

734
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
with the gold band,

735
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
switching,

736
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
spitting like a bionic sneeze,

737
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
that frees vodka,

738
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
just to clear the air,

739
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
like the ionic breeze,

740
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
quadro,

741
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
slick enough out,

742
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
try a box for it,

743
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
chicken pot pie,

744
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
thinking outside the box.

745
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Love to taste her gritty,

746
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
but got no time to be wasted,

747
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and chasing putty,

748
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
how for daffy duck,

749
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
bucks,

750
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
porky pig,

751
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
bucks,

752
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
bunny,

753
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
boomper,

754
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
or for that type of wrapped country,

755
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
or deep house,

756
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
?

757
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
hmmm,

758
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
anyway,

759
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
you don't get a lot of wrap hip-hop,

760
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
rmb from the pod safe music network

761
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
that I really like about this.

762
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah,

763
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and I keep the hand擊,

764
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
it sounds good,

765
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
sound in it really,

766
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
but I like it.

767
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Homers.podshow.com

768
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
is where you can upload your promo to me,

769
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
feedback,

770
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
you can still probably send through Gmail.

771
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,640
You can also put it up there. It's really cool because I've set it up as a as a

772
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
You know the RSS feed is a pod cast

773
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,760
So I can just basically open up. I'm using iTunes for that open that up, but you know

774
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Oh geez, I must have at least

775
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,200
Oh, it looks like I have 30 or 40 different promos in there. So we listen to a couple of them just to see

776
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,480
Yeah, and and of course this the same rules apply if I get bored or if it sucks

777
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Then I'll just go move on to the next one

778
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,520
Hello Delta Sierra Charlie fans. I'm Lauren I'm an I'd like to tell you about a new podcast geek counterpoint

779
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,800
If you're like a lot of people you may find mass media coverage of scientific and technical issues to be

780
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,040
Confusing and consistent even annoying and if that's how you feel I've just got one thing to say to you

781
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
It's not your fault

782
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,800
The fact of the matter is coverage of science and technology is being dramatically reduced

783
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,840
Many reporters that have been dedicated to covering science and technology have been laid off and the

784
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,600
Resulting coverage is often mangled dumb downs sensationalized and stripped of any context

785
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,840
So if you've fed up with soundbite science go to geek counterpoint.net

786
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,640
You can subscribe to the podcast either through links on the website or straight through iTunes

We're in the past. If I could take it back. I would do this all again if I could.

807
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,400
I

808
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
rely

809
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,600

Where I needed anything, I suggest

Going beg for 1 day all the things that I would swim

If I tried everything, and the hope to make you forget

815
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,780
If I said, all the mistakes that I made were in the past

816
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,080
If I could take it back, I would do this on a game

817
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:23,460

818
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:29,460

832
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,460

843
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,620
Who got some hotel staff jumping to let me back in my room last night

844
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:27,620
Many thanks had no idea who you are, but now I do presentation was great

845
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,620
I publish a quarterly magazine for advertiser clients and we're writing a feature on podcasting in the next issue

846
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,620
If I send you our details could be interview you regards Heather Bowler will of course

847
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,620
Heather now that may have sounded a little bit weird

848
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,620
But this was when I we were checking in last night around quarter to ten

849
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,620
And she'd locked herself out of a room and had a credit card, but it wasn't her credit card

850
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,620
Didn't have her name on it, so it was but anyway, so I

851
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,620
I told the when the the check in the desk clerk said anything else I can do

852
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,620
Yes, please please let this young lady back in her room

853
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,620
And so it happened okay

854
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:09,620
I'm still using the Heil microphone by the way. I love this mic. This is great

855
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,620
It sounds wonderful

856
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:18,620
Ron heard the switch the mics switch as well on the Saturday podcast and he's a real audio file

857
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:24,620
And he said it sounded pretty damn good too. Yeah, this is good and someone sent me an email about the Heil stuff

858
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,620
Let me see I saw that coming today

859
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:34,620
Some super star celebrity works with it. Here we go Nate doer doer doer

860
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:40,620
Just catching up on Delta Sierra Charlie to seven eight heard you mention it

861
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,620
You got a free Heil sound mic Bob Heil makes very nice stuff

862
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,620
Ah Joe Wall Schwartz with Bob regularly doing promotion of his mics and gear

863
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,620
Okay, yeah, there you go. Well, if it's good for Joe damn it's good for us wouldn't you say

864
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,620
So again, it's promo dot pod show dot com please

865
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:04,620
Feel free you got a register, but that's not just a email address and you make up a password and then you can

866
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:09,620
Post something about your promo and if you want you can attach

867
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:17,620
Or just a post a link in there which points to an MP3 file and then it would you will be guaranteed that I'm going to hear it

868
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:23,620
Because it plops into a nice little playlist in my iTunes, which is extremely nice now it would be great if we could

869
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:28,620
Sign off with our signature sound which of course

870
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,620
I don't have

871
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,620
Shoot I don't have my pod show sign off thingy

872
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,620
Ah, that sucks. Okay, we'll do it this way. Hey everybody

873
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:44,620
Please save me from people who've been told what to like and then like it

874
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:50,620
In my opinion if you're over six years of age and you're still getting your music from the radio

875
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,620
Something is desperately wrong with you

876
00:48:53,620 --> 00:49:02,620
I can only hope that somehow MP3 players and file sharing will destroy FM radio the way they're destroying record companies

877
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:09,620
Then even though the air will probably never be safe to breathe again, maybe it will be safer to listen to
