1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Using just a tin can, a ball of twine, a package of burpy flower seeds, and a nine-volt

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,120
battery, the single-handedly-invented podcasting, supported by an army of queers, purverts,

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,840
child molesters, and white supremacists, he is marching towards podcasting dominance and

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,200
forced commercialization.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,280
The secret goal is to control the world by owning all access to the internet.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,480
Soon, if you want to podcast on this planet, you will have to go through it.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,680
Who is this man?

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Now I'm falling in deep, pray, and for sleep, three hours and night ain't enough.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Yeah, just call their baby, Lord help, baby, and I'm just a little, a little in love.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Something tells me there's no such thing, a little in love.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,200
Here the next thing, you know you're out by an array of myths, got to be strong, and I'm

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,200
trying to hold on, but be in that tough dream, because I'm all about her, one thing's

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:47,200
for sure, I'm just a little in love.

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Everything's rose, neighbors getting notes, she's been over three times this week,

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:05,200
and last a little swim, every time I see her, I'm thinking that I must be, little in love.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Something tells me there's no such thing, a little in love.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Here the next thing, you know you're out by an array of myths, got to be strong, and

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm trying to hold on, but be in that tough dream, because I'm all about her, one

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
thing's for sure, I'm just a little in love.

20
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Well, I guess it sounds crazy, it's too late to say, be a note there, I know, bro.

21
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Something tells me there's no such thing, a little in love.

22
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,200
And the next thing, you know you're out by an array of myths, got to be strong, and

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
I'm trying to hold on, but be in that tough dream, because I'm all about her, one thing

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:19,200
's for sure, I'm just a little in love, I'm just a little in love, I'm just a little in love.

25
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I know a lot of you may have shuddle, pat, hold on a second, sorry, didn't mean to have all that going on.

26
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,200
I know a lot of you must have shuffled past that song, but I can't help but there's something inside me that just says,

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,200
yeah, country, I kind of like it. This guy's great. He showed up on the podcast, music network on Saturday.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I played it Saturday night, Patricia went, hey, that's pretty damn good. It's actually from the album titled

29
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Songs for Saturday Night, so that came across just at the perfect time. And he looks good.

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I mean, this is a country superstar, as far as I'm concerned, anyone else that I've seen on the country,

31
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,200
country music awards, come on, step on up, take the challenge with this guy. Excellent, really, really dug it.

32
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,200
So welcome, everybody. I thought that was the perfect way to start off a Monday. I don't know, I just got my blood flowing.

33
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,200
This is the Daily Source Code, Delta Sierra Charlie 2, 9 or 1. I've stopped doing the tags at the beginning of the show.

34
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,200
We used to do that solely for people who had shuffles and didn't have a readout.

35
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,200
So I hope you don't mind if you have a shuffle. You might want to consider upgrading because I got tired of doing that at the beginning labeling.

36
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:53,200
The label is on the, on the, on the file. There you go. So we had kind of a interesting end of last week.

37
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:01,200
You can imagine that I took a lot of time over the weekend to reflect and just chill out and hang out with the girls and we watched a shitload of television.

38
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I have, I must admit, I, here's the shows that I'm completely into. This still, this, I'm a celebrity getting me out of here.

39
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:15,200
The, we're down to the finals, which is tonight. Oh, it's getting really scary. And in here are still,

40
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Carol, a, thatcher, who was Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Ladies daughter and boy issue,

41
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Shari, if we get her last name, she's a footballer's wife and an actress, but she's just, they call her smurf and she's just fantastic and cute and fun.

42
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,200
And then there's Sid Owen, who I believe is New Zealand or Australian actor and Jimmy Osmond left last night.

43
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Little Jimmy Osmond, remember him, the long-haired lover from Liverpool. And it's, you know,

44
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,200
even though there's no big controversies this year, no one having sex and no one fighting.

45
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,200
It's actually been very nice to watch because of the bonding of this group. It's just, it's been, it's been great.

46
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Unlike X-factor, if it's coming to the States, it's Simon Cowell's new version or his version of American Idol,

47
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,200
which, of course, is called something different in every different country.

48
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
It's called, what does it call pop idols here in the UK?

49
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Yeah. So the X-factor is they're supposed to choose, and it is all based on singing and performance,

50
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
but it's supposed to be chosen upon someone having the X-factor.

51
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,200
And I think the only guy who actually had the X-factor, this guy Chico, I got voted out this weekend as well.

52
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,200
So that's, that's unfortunate. Anyway, so we watched a lot of that.

53
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
And it listened to a lot of podcasts.

54
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I'd always try to listen to as many podcasts as possible on the weekend,

55
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,200
or when I'm traveling, as you can imagine, it's pretty damn hard to listen.

56
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
You can't listen to everything, but I really try to get a good sampling of most,

57
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
what people are talking about.

58
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
And so this weekend, I went into the,

59
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Godcasters network, you know, that I enjoy inspirational messages.

60
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I've talked about that quite a bit.

61
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Listen to the one-year anniversary show that Steve Web did.

62
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
He interviewed me on that show, which was nice to hear.

63
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Listen to a little father, a little rev Tim.

64
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
You know, these guys got great inspirational podcasts that always lift me up.

65
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
And I think it was a week ago, maybe two weeks ago,

66
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
that I played you a promo of something called InsightWorks.

67
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
InsightWorks.com with a Y, actually.

68
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
So it's Indian, November, Shira, Yankee, Tango,

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Delo, Whiskey, Oscar, Romeo, Kilo, Sierra, dot com.

70
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,200
That I had, and actually when I played that promo,

71
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I believe I said, hey, I'm subscribed.

72
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
And so I ran across their show.

73
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
And I heard them talking about me on this particular episode,

74
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
and they were referencing back to something they had sent me in email.

75
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,200
So I immediately went to the Gmail box to the search and loan behold on red, of course.

76
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
There was a message they had sent me.

77
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,200
And I wanted to share that with you on today's daily source code.

78
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
As you're up, and this is Suzanne.

79
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
We are InsightWorks.com.

80
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,200
That's I, N, S, Y, T, W, O, R, K, S, dot com.

81
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,200
And we just wanted to respond to your show yesterday.

82
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,200
It's a roller coaster ride that I witnessed every single day online.

83
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
People who rise to the top get kicked down,

84
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
or there's people ready to kick them down or drag them down.

85
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, Robin and I had a very interesting dialogue.

86
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,200
After he said, honey, you've got to listen to what Adam's talking about because he is unwittingly

87
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,200
and unknowingly describing shadow and its projection.

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,200
So Adam, we would like to share these terms with you coming from a depth perspective,

89
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,200
and until these are youngy and terms, the work of CG young, and it's applicable to every person out there.

90
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
But let's start at the beginning.

91
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Next we have our persona, okay?

92
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
That is our social mask.

93
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
That's our psychological clothing.

94
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
The way we want to be perceived by the rest of the world.

95
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
And ourselves.

96
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
We try and come.

97
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
And ourselves exactly.

98
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
And then we have the ego.

99
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
And that's all of our conscious material.

100
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,200
But then anything that is too painful for us to own about ourselves is relegated to the shadow.

101
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,200
So what happens to all that stuff that we shove in the shadow?

102
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
It's like a real shadow.

103
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I think it's that bag of stuff that we don't want anybody to see that we drag around behind us.

104
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes, I call it the invisible ball in chain that's attached to our angles that we don't acknowledge

105
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
that there in other people constantly are tripping over our invisible ball in chain.

106
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
That's our shadow stuff.

107
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
And when it's too painful for us to own, what do we do?

108
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
We project it.

109
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Our planet has gone through two world wars because of shadow projection.

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
There can be individual projections.

111
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
There are cultural projections.

112
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
National any kind of group.

113
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Right.

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Right.

115
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Any type of group.

116
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
There can be neighborhood projections.

117
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Neighbors can get together.

118
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,200
And they pick one person to carry the collective nastiness for the group.

119
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
The black sheep.

120
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
That's who gets it.

121
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Adam, you're being singled out as the online neighborhood black sheep that everybody's projecting

122
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
their stuff on.

123
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,200
So Adam, the people who are projecting their negative stuff onto you.

124
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Don't claim it.

125
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
That's their stuff.

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Anytime somebody projects something onto us.

127
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Or we project onto someone else.

128
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
It's always beneficial to step back.

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Look in the mirror.

130
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
That takes a lot of effort.

131
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,200
And that's what we say in our podcast series that looking into ourselves through depth

132
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
psychology leads to healing.

133
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
So all those people that are projecting their shadow onto you.

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
They should take a look at themselves.

135
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
And it takes a lot of work.

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Yeah.

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
It's very painful to look into ourselves.

138
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
So Adam, don't claim it.

139
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
When people make these comments about you.

140
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Yeah.

141
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Just know it's really not about you at all.

142
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
It's more about them.

143
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Yeah.

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
What's in their shadow?

145
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Before we close, I would just like to quote something of Robert Johnson, who was a later

146
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
disciple of Young's.

147
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Johnson says the shadow gone autonomous is a terrible monster in our psychic house.

148
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Another quote that I want to give is from you Adam.

149
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
But I think that in general, everyone is a nice person.

150
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
This tells me the behind your social mask behind your persona.

151
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
You are a nice person.

152
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Yeah.

153
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
And that's the golden your shadows.

154
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
The congratulations.

155
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Thank you so much for opening up this dialogue.

156
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,200
And that's what we believe is that insight really does work.

157
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Robert Johnson's book on a new shadow is available through our website.

158
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,200
We also have a previous podcast on the 9th of September about projection.

159
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Check it out at insightworks.com.

160
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I am S.Y.T.W.O.R.K.S.

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
.com.

162
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Thanks for sharing the journey.

163
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Adam and thanks for listening.

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Tailwims.

165
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Hi for Neil.

166
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Who's guys?

167
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Tailwims.

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Hey, Robin.

169
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Thank you very much.

170
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I was really, really nice.

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Robin and Suzanne.

172
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
You can imagine.

173
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I spent a lot of the weekend getting my own shadow and check.

174
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,200
And it was really wonderful to have that message come through through a podcast.

175
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
It was perfect.

176
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
You know, it made so much sense.

177
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
And it saved me hundreds of dollars at the shrink.

178
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Happy center class, by the way, if you're in the Netherlands.

179
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Today is December 5th.

180
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
The day that the Dutch version of Santa Claus.

181
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I'll just call it that.

182
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
It's not entirely fair.

183
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
But this guy shows up with a white horse.

184
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Oh, we've talked about this so many times every year, I guess.

185
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Two, two times so far, then, perhaps.

186
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I talked about a lot on the weblog.

187
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
He shows up on his white horse.

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
He has his what they call black peats, which has always been a topic of discussion.

189
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
But he comes from Spain on a big steamboat.

190
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,200
And then he and his trusty steed go from rooftop to rooftop filling.

191
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
The little boys and girls shoes.

192
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,200
He used to be wooden shoes with all kinds of presents and goodies and candies.

193
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
And if the boys and girls were bad, then the black peats pick him up.

194
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Put him the bag and ship him off with him back to Spain.

195
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,200
And so what has come out of that holiday is that traditionally families get together on this day.

196
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
They draw lots or straws.

197
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
And you have to make a surprise present for another member of the family.

198
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,200
And then each member of the family has a little list of stuff that they want to have.

199
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
And there's a top price limit on what everyone can spend.

200
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
And it's great.

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
And I do miss that.

202
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I must say, although we've never done it ourselves.

203
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Because we celebrate, well, I guess Christmas even for us is.

204
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
It used to be really important when Christina was young.

205
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
You know, big, you know, presents underneath the tree.

206
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Now I think we all just kind of dig the tree, the egg nog, the fireplace.

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
They've got these great new fire logs, by the way, called Crackle logs.

208
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm not allowed to burn wood here in the cottage, Patricia won't let me.

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
But these crackle logs, they burn for three hours.

210
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
It's a traditional, you know, fire log.

211
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,200
One hunk of biofuel probably all kinds of shitty chemicals in there.

212
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
But it now crackles too.

213
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
And it sounds just like real wood.

214
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
And that's, and that's really, really nice.

215
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,200
It's really a religious celebration for us at all, but just just a time to,

216
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,200
to warm up to the fire and snuggle with you loved ones.

217
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
By the way, that, that comment and that whole series.

218
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
And I did listen to the September 9th, September 9th,

219
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
or 7th podcast that they suggested about projection and shadow and all that.

220
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
It sounds very much like a book that I read when I was a kid.

221
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I came, I remember the, was it,

222
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,200
oh, it wasn't the incredible journey that was about animals.

223
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
But it was about this, this group of people.

224
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
It was definitely science fiction,

225
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,200
trekking through landscape to some version of kind of like an Oz.

226
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
And everyone had a burden on their back.

227
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
And, you know, the bigger you're burdened,

228
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
that was all the crap that you wanted to throw behind you,

229
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
but it literally hung on your back and would drag people down.

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Some people had enormous burdens, and some had very, very small.

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
And again, I really appreciate that, that helped me a lot.

232
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Yeah, of course not everyone was as kind.

233
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Witness, mark,

234
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
and become one of Nashaconda,

235
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,200
and then the Pacific Coast Hell Players from Pacific Coast Hell Way.

236
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Because we never know when to leave well enough alone

237
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,200
and let a good bit die with dignity.

238
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I bring you,

239
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
porn versus Adam Curry.

240
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
So this is the difference between porn

241
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
and Adam Curry.

242
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
All right, got it.

243
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
All right, here we go.

244
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Porn versus Adam Curry.

245
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I prefer my porn to be straight.

246
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,200
The porn I like usually has as little hair as possible.

247
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Hey, porn versus Adam Curry.

248
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Just like porn,

249
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
you can be in Adam Curry if you're well hung.

250
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Oh God.

251
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Hey, porn versus Adam Curry.

252
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,200
In sheer numbers of guys stroking it to one or the other,

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200
porn still holds out a slight edge.

254
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Oh.

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Hey, porn doesn't call you up stone

256
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
in the middle of the night,

257
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
crying how you won't return their tortured love letters.

258
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Hey, porn versus Adam Curry.

259
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
German bondage curry.

260
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Not on my Christmas gift list.

261
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Oh.

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
You know,

263
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
another difference between porn and Adam Curry

264
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,200
is that porn is still legal in most states

265
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
and let's just say that Adam Curry

266
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
lives in the UK for a reason.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh,

268
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
porn versus Adam Curry.

269
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Hey, let's face it.

270
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
You'd probably be a lot more embarrassed

271
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
if your mom walked in on you watching Adam Curry.

272
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Oh, God.

273
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
In turn, guys, was that yours?

274
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
That's good.

275
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Get me some soup.

276
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Okay.

277
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Hey, porn versus Adam Curry.

278
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Both made this year's top 10 list

279
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
of things that give boners to the incarcerated.

280
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh.

281
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Oh, porn versus Adam Curry.

282
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
The San Fernando Valley

283
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
isn't littered with the broken dreams of cocaine

284
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,200
addicted teenage runaways who are in Adam Curry movies.

285
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh.

286
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Porn versus Adam Curry.

287
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Given the choice,

288
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Madge Weinstein would rather be in porn.

289
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Oh, God.

290
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
You know,

291
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
I've heard that Ron Jeremy refuses to perform

292
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
with Adam Curry on moral grounds.

293
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh.

294
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Hey, it finally.

295
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Porn versus Adam Curry.

296
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Adam Curry show is not made by some

297
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
CD characters in Southern California.

298
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
That's our show.

299
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Check him out at Pacific Coast.

300
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Hellway.com.

301
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Mark Yoshimoto Nemcroff in the Pacific Coast

302
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Hellplayers.

303
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Thank you, guys.

304
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
That was nice.

305
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
I hope, well, I actually, I'm glad my mom

306
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
isn't listening to this.

307
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Hey, by the way, so I didn't get out

308
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
over the weekend wasn't able to go.

309
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Wasn't able to go flying.

310
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
So that's screwed everything up.

311
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm not going to go now until probably in the new year.

312
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
No, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Just before Christmas.

314
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Don't tell my mom if you know her.

315
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Patricia Christine and I are going to fly over

316
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
going to surprise her with a surprise visit.

317
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
So that'll be the next trip.

318
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,200
So no traveling in the in the Charlie 182 for a little bit.

319
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Unfortunately, God was so looking forward to.

320
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
And yesterday was a beautiful day.

321
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Today was fantastic.

322
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
But I had to move everything around.

323
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
So I didn't get around to that.

324
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
That story that I talked about.

325
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,200
The vegan podcast, the the the podcast,

326
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
whose feed was hijacked.

327
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
That's quite a story now.

328
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm reading about it everywhere.

329
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
And as always, there are multiple sides of the story.

330
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
I don't.

331
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I really don't think there was any tremendous malicious intent.

332
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
I think this sounds like a lot of communication.

333
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Confusion as it comes to ransomning and all that kind of stuff.

334
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,200
But there is a real problem with with RSS feeds.

335
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
And I've even noticed myself now that on the pod keywords,

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
which I don't believe I registered for.

337
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
They have a version of my feed there.

338
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Who knows how many times people have subscribed there.

339
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Audio, which I've I don't think I've claimed my feed.

340
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
But I believe that there's multiple feeds over there.

341
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Now, of course, at issue here,

342
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
forget all the hijacking stuff.

343
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Just the idea of caching feeds.

344
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Very much the way feed burner does.

345
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
There is an associated risk with all this.

346
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,200
And I guess that's just never a good policy to be working on a copy of anything

347
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
than the original, which could change at any moment, even if it sucked in.

348
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,200
You know, witness all the issues we've had with iTunes and people not being able to

349
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
change their feeds.

350
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
And yeah, there's automatic ways to do it.

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,200
But with still many podcasters, there are a lot of people falling off the edge

352
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
and just not getting stuff done.

353
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
And that really does bite.

354
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
I don't have any clear cut solutions for it.

355
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,200
But if it all possible, once you have a feed that is your podcast feed,

356
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
keep it what it is.

357
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
And the best way, and a lot of people, I don't know if you understood what I was talking about

358
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
by getting a domain name.

359
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
But that really is the best way to make your feed be able to migrate.

360
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Excuse me.

361
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
I didn't say hell.

362
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Do in that, you know, because when you see that sense of

363
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
commercial and television, you're going to think of me.

364
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
That's a daily source code, at least.

365
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,200
So, I have the most fucked up feed in the world.

366
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
What is it like?

367
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Weblogs.com slash zero zero zero zero zero one four zero something like that.

368
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Slash category is it's horrible.

369
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
But the folks at user land have told me that when I'm ready for it,

370
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
they'll be happy to put a redirect in, which is going to be very cool,

371
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
which I totally appreciate.

372
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Speaking of hijacked, I don't know if you were following the story about

373
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
podcast pickle, which is podcast directory.

374
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Someone hacked into podcast pickle.com into their servers.

375
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,200
And from what I read online, apparently someone actually did hold

376
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,200
the guys at podcast pickle ransom for like 10 grand

377
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
to, you know, to give them their code back.

378
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,200
God, you know, I'd like some of those smart people that I've read from

379
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,200
this weekend to go and, you know, track that guy down.

380
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
That's a real asshole Christel mighty.

381
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
So apparently podcast pickle is back up.

382
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,200
They're back on the air, but they lost their forums, which I think is really

383
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,200
a travesty because forums are such an important piece of, you know,

384
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
recording the, the community.

385
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
And so, you know, there'll be no way to get back to, you know,

386
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
what the, the social community at podcast pickle was talking about.

387
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
They've never, all those links that go to forum articles, Google

388
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
and other search indices.

389
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh, man, that's, that's really, really nasty.

390
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Let me see.

391
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
So we unleashed pod say for peace.

392
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
If every day we're Christmas, already the most played song on the pod

393
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,200
safe music network, just going gangbusters.

394
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I put a link to, to the page, so you can see which podcast of play

395
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
to misjust outrageous.

396
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
So it's number one for the month already.

397
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I think it'll stay that way.

398
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
So I think the support is, is just phenomenal.

399
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I believe slow is in the process of getting the web page up for,

400
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I think it'll be at pod, pod safe for peace.

401
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
And today we're all over the iTunes music store calling,

402
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
trying to get them to, let us put that song in,

403
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
hopefully on that.

404
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I think they do uploads on Tuesdays or maybe on Fridays or something like

405
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
that.

406
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
So instead of it taking weeks, as it does with most independent music,

407
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
we probably, I think we'll be able to slip it by it.

408
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
It'd be great if they would help us and support.

409
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I know the folks over there listen and we're going to put in some calls today.

410
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
So that you could actually buy it.

411
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,200
And it's not for the DRM that we would put up on iTunes,

412
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,200
but solely for ease of purchasing, I think, is what it's all about.

413
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
There's just no way we're going to get any type of purchasing

414
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
up and running on the pod safe music network and time for Christmas.

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Yeah, maybe around Christmas, which wouldn't make a lot of sense.

416
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
But if you have a podcast, please go over to the pod safe music network

417
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,200
register as a podcaster if you're not already.

418
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
And I give it a spin.

419
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
You'll find it under pod safe for peace.

420
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Some people have had problems finding it in the PMN.

421
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Something that I noticed, someone's got me an email about this as well,

422
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
is that if you have more than one show on the pod safe music network,

423
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
it really doesn't work for you because when you report back,

424
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
you report back on your show, which you registered with,

425
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
which in my case is a daily source code.

426
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
So we have to come up with a way to add another show to your account.

427
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Which I don't think is a hard thing to do.

428
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Because I was putting together the pod show Christmas podcast feed,

429
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
which you can find at xmus.podshow.com,

430
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
which I'm having a great time doing.

431
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Lots of fantastic feedback.

432
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,200
I decided not to put one song per episode.

433
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Even if it had a Christmas greeting over the intro or anything like that,

434
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I felt it would make a lot more sense to put two back to back with a greeting

435
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
in between.

436
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Because we don't want to just be sending out the MP3 files.

437
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,200
It's kind of defeating the whole purpose of allowing pod safe music

438
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
to be played for promotional purposes.

439
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,200
So now there's already six songs out there.

440
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
They come in pairs.

441
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,200
And I think that if you subscribe to the feed and then maybe make a playlist

442
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
to only of those portions of those song bits,

443
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
those bytes, those chunks that come in,

444
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
throw it on shuffle.

445
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
I think it might actually work.

446
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,200
I think we get like 10 or 15 in there to be 30 tracks.

447
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
And I think the repetition won't even be too bad.

448
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
If you've heard the transition a couple of times from one song to the next.

449
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,200
And gosh, there's so much good stuff coming in.

450
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Oh yeah.

451
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Okay.

452
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,200
So regarding the pod safe for peace,

453
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,200
we've received comments.

454
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
I don't know if they're all,

455
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
I think most of them relate to pod safe music.

456
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Let's start with Howard Greenstein first.

457
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,200
It's Howard Greenstein from the confessions of an integral podcast

458
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
with Barry Coral.

459
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Barry Coral.com.

460
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
And I'm giving you a little audio feedback about UNICEF's response

461
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,200
when Slaw or whomever asked for an endorsement

462
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
of the pod safe for peace project.

463
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
What you might not know,

464
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,200
even though you've known me on an office since the on ramp days,

465
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
was that at the Twin Towers Fund,

466
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
where I was at for two years after 9-11,

467
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I managed over $168 million for the families of fire police

468
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
and emergency workers killed on 9-11.

469
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
And we literally got hundreds of off

470
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,200
from independent artists to donate the proceeds of records

471
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
to the families.

472
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
And most of the time,

473
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
we couldn't accept it.

474
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
In fact, the only thing that I recall really accepting

475
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,200
was the big Sony Madison Square Garden concert

476
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
that generated lots of millions of dollars.

477
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
And the reason was not that we didn't want to support

478
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
these independent artists,

479
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
but basically not for profit law and lawyers

480
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
and accounts need to audit projects

481
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
that are endorsed by a charity under American law.

482
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Now, I'm not sure how UNICEF works,

483
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
but I suspect it's similar.

484
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
And again, I'm not a lawyer,

485
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
but I have a pretty good perspective on this.

486
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Charity accepts a donation of a record proceeds

487
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
and is that grosser is that net, et cetera.

488
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
They need to be able to audit it.

489
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
They need to be able to make a legal agreement

490
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,200
that says you agree that any proceeds of gross or net

491
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
will come to name of charity, et cetera, et cetera,

492
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
and lawyers have to sign on both sides

493
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
and agree what the grosses and what the net is with it.

494
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Anyway, it becomes a big deal.

495
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
And therefore, that's probably why UNICEF

496
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
when hearing that you might get a couple of thousand dollars

497
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
to them said we love it, please send the money,

498
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
but we can't officially endorse the project.

499
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
It would just have too much legal and accounting overhead.

500
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
So for anyone wondering why they probably

501
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
couldn't endorse this project, my suspicion is that's the case.

502
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
One other thing I wanted to just say

503
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
that the project sounds great,

504
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
what if every day for Christmas is a great song,

505
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
we've created the Slaw and all the artists that did it,

506
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
and you for coming up with this idea,

507
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
and I hope that a whole bunch of money

508
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
goes towards UNICEF's way,

509
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
because that would really be a wonderful thing

510
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
for the children in the world

511
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
who would benefit from this money.

512
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
So thanks for working on the project.

513
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I thought the listeners might find that useful,

514
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
and I'll catch up with you soon.

515
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Take care. Bye-bye.

516
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
I'm great Howard. Thank you.

517
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Yeah, I kind of figured that,

518
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
and I saw when I had actually discussed that.

519
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
By the way, two more credits need to go out

520
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Orlando, the co-writer of the song along with Slaw,

521
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
and also we've got,

522
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
when I premiered yesterday to mention John Hammond,

523
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
who also played as a great musician,

524
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
who I met at the in Ontario,

525
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
the podcast,

526
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
the portable media expo.

527
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Yeah, it kind of figures that,

528
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I don't think it's so much that UNICEF rejected,

529
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
because we couldn't bring in a large chunk,

530
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
or couldn't guarantee a large chunk of money.

531
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
I think it's more because the vibe you get immediately

532
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
is more of like, you know,

533
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
who you guys trying to take our brand

534
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
and trying to propel yourselves into something.

535
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
That's the vibe that I've gotten before with charities,

536
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
which is kind of funky.

537
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
I understand it's all protectionist-based,

538
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
because I'm sure there's a lot of people

539
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
that want to say, hey, listen to me,

540
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
listen to me as an artist,

541
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
because I'm doing something for UNICEF,

542
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
and you should promote me,

543
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
and here's my UNICEF tag,

544
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
and I'm sure that that can be a real issue.

545
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Let's so be it.

546
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
You know, everyone's hearts in a right place,

547
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
and I think that's really what it's about.

548
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
And if not, it's awareness for UNICEF,

549
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
that helps to boost excellence.

550
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Did I have something here?

551
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah, a couple more audio comments.

552
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Hey Adam, this is Avi.

553
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
One thing I've hated about traditional radios

554
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
that they play Christmas songs back to back to back.

555
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
And so when you announced that you were doing

556
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
some Christmas song,

557
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
what if everyday were Christmas?

558
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I figured, oh dear,

559
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
just another thing to fast forward through when I listen.

560
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
But then when you were done, I figured,

561
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
well, I might as well actually listen to what

562
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
once and see what it's like.

563
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
And so I heard it,

564
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
and it's been what three days now,

565
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
and it's totally stuck in my head,

566
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
and I can't get rid of it.

567
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
And then you were talking about how when you were

568
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
figuring when you first heard of it,

569
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
you said, oh, you know,

570
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
we could do a weird,

571
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
the world kind of thing with this,

572
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
which of course got that song in my head.

573
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
And then the two songs just kind of

574
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
bred together and came out with this mutant thing

575
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
that kind of ends up like this.

576
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
We are the world,

577
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,200
we are the children,

578
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
we are the ones to make a proud day,

579
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
so let's start giving.

580
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
There's a choice we're making

581
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
what's even our own lives.

582
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
There's true make a better day,

583
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
just you and me.

584
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
So, yeah?

585
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Well, I have a Merry Christmas

586
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
into those two mid-applies.

587
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
How can I make a semiaf?

588
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
And I'll see you around.

589
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
You know, that's a mashup,

590
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
is what you just did there.

591
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
That was good.

592
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
I like that.

593
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Oh, man, most excellent.

594
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,200
And now the pod save for piece song

595
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,200
has even been covered in another language,

596
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
a Dutch version showed up,

597
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
which I'm not going to,

598
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
I'm not going to bother you with that,

599
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
but it's on the pod save music network.

600
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Let me see if I have the link here.

601
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
We'll drop that into the show notes,

602
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
obviously Dutch pod save for piece.

603
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Hold on.

604
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I actually created a link for myself

605
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
for the artist details.

606
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I'm going to make sure I tell you.

607
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
A Berry and Uly.

608
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Our Dutch podcasters,

609
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
who occasionally write songs,

610
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
they made a Dutch cover of pod save for pieces.

611
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Shit, you know what?

612
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm here anyway.

613
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
I'll just click on the listen button,

614
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
so you can just hear a little piece of it.

615
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Mine as well.

616
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,200
They did their own track too,

617
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
by the way.

618
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
It's very cool.

619
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
So, you know what?

620
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I think if there are Dutch pod save

621
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
and music artists,

622
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
go for it.

623
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I'm sure Slower would be happy

624
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
to help you up with some tracks.

625
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
And if there's any other languages out there

626
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
that any other people speak other languages,

627
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
they want to put that together.

628
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Dude, it's cool.

629
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Look at how look at what we're doing.

630
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
This lays me.

631
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
They're out of my name's Scheme.

632
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm a teenage podcaster.

633
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
I just got my podcast,

634
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
the Nodcast started like three weeks ago.

635
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
And I got to say,

636
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
I am just loving being part of this community.

637
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I've been a listener since

638
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I'd say middle of the summer sometime

639
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
when I discovered it and decided to check it out

640
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
in iTunes.

641
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
And I just,

642
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I just loved being part of this.

643
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,200
I think this new Christmas song

644
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
that just came out is great.

645
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I'd loved playing on my show.

646
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
It may, oh man,

647
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,200
it just made me kind of,

648
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
sent shivers through my spine

649
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
when I heard it on your show.

650
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
So, I've been listening to

651
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,200
the Daily Source code for a while.

652
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Since I've been listening to podcasts.

653
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
And I was just wondering,

654
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
you,

655
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
from what you said,

656
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
it sounds like,

657
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,200
if a song is licensed under

658
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Asked at BMI or whatever,

659
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
then you can't play on a podcast.

660
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
So, if your license is this song,

661
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
under that,

662
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
then doesn't that mean I'm going to have to pay

663
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
if I want to play it,

664
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
or that I just can't?

665
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Because I don't know whatever.

666
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
It wasn't on a PMM.

667
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
So, I'll just probably play it anyway,

668
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
but I don't know much about this,

669
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
obviously,

670
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,200
but I was just had that question.

671
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Also,

672
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
not necessarily,

673
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
in regards to what Madge had to say

674
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
the other day,

675
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I have been having troubles

676
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
with iTunes.

677
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
It's not that my show showed up

678
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
and then disappeared,

679
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
but I just cannot get it to show up.

680
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Because I submitted my,

681
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
my feed to the music store before

682
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
and had anything in it.

683
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Got an email from the music store

684
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
saying that I had abused my privileges

685
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
or something like that,

686
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
and that there was a problem with my feed,

687
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
and I needed to fix it,

688
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
and then resubmit it.

689
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Well,

690
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
there's obviously no way to resubmit a feed

691
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
to the music store,

692
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
because I've put something in my feed

693
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
and resubmit it,

694
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
and it says it's already been submitted.

695
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
So,

696
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
I've been having quite a bit of trouble with that.

697
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I tried calling Apple a couple times,

698
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
and apparently they put it under the heading

699
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
of computer technical support,

700
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,200
and they're going to charge me 50 bucks

701
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,200
just to talk to someone about this problem.

702
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,200
So, I don't really know what's up with that.

703
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I've been trying not to exactly rely

704
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,200
on the music store for showing up my podcast,

705
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,200
and I've been just trying to work around it.

706
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
So,

707
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
on a lighter note,

708
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
I just want to thank you for putting up this

709
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Xmas.podshow.com thing,

710
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
and for putting out the original idea

711
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
for the pod save for peace song,

712
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
which I love.

713
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
And,

714
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I guess that's about it.

715
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
I should be making a promo soon.

716
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
I'll definitely send that to you,

717
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,200
and submit it to promos.podshow.com.

718
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Anyway,

719
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
thanks for definitely being one of my main

720
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
inspirations,

721
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
and it's great to be part of this community.

722
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Thanks.

723
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Yo, Shme.

724
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Okay, first of all,

725
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
what I really liked about that feedback,

726
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
listening to Shme.

727
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
That's me.

728
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
That's me.

729
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I can tell.

730
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
So,

731
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
enthusiastic little podcaster there.

732
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Shme, fantastic.

733
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
And welcome.

734
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm glad you're digging it so much.

735
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Let me work backwards.

736
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Regarding iTunes,

737
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,200
yeah, that is a problem.

738
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
So, first of all,

739
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I hope that spending this promo or this feedback

740
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
on the source code gets you some exposure,

741
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
so that's the nodcast.com.

742
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
And I know the folks over at Apple

743
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
listen to the show,

744
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
so maybe they'll be able to help you.

745
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
And I guess the only other thing would be

746
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
is to to resubmit with a whole new feed URL.

747
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I know it sucks,

748
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
but this is,

749
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
you kind of fell in between

750
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
between the cracks,

751
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
you know,

752
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I wish I could help you,

753
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
but this,

754
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
you know,

755
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
yeah,

756
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
you have no idea how many people

757
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
call me or email me about this problem.

758
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
And,

759
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
you know,

760
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
all you can do is just put it in the queue,

761
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
you know,

762
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
it's hard running a huge directory

763
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
as a single entity.

764
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
It really is very,

765
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
very hard.

766
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Let me see.

767
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Oh, yes.

768
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
So, now about AskCabbyMI.

769
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Even though I've gone over before,

770
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I want to go over it one more time.

771
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
And this only is applicable

772
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
to music that is licensed for performance,

773
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
so that's broadcast and performance otherwise,

774
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
through AskCabbyMI.

775
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
It appears that in most other countries,

776
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
certainly the ones we've heard from in Europe,

777
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
are the Netherlands,

778
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Germany, France,

779
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Finland,

780
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
and I'm sure most others,

781
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
if you sign a deal with them for your performing rights,

782
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
then you actually can't play it

783
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
even on your own podcast

784
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
without paying that performance rights.

785
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
So that's a whole

786
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
another can of worms that we've got to work on.

787
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
But in the States,

788
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
if music is licensed under AskCabbyMI,

789
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
and the person who registers that

790
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,200
with the pod save music network owns everything else,

791
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
then you have a license to play it,

792
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
because it's a special license for you

793
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,200
and AskCabbyMI recognize that.

794
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Subsequently, if the song,

795
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
just like if every day we're Christmas,

796
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
which is registered with AskCabbyMI

797
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
through SLOW and Orlando,

798
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,200
if that is played on the radio,

799
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
then actual money gets paid,

800
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
and it'll go to a SLOW and Orlando,

801
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200
and they promise that they will give their proceeds

802
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
to UNICEF,

803
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
and SLOW is also promised to clarify

804
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
exactly how the mechanics of that work

805
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
once he gets the website up,

806
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
and I'm confident that that'll be very cool,

807
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
no problem.

808
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
The thing that isn't allowed though,

809
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
you can't come into the pod save music network

810
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
as a broadcaster,

811
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
like a radio station,

812
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
or television,

813
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
or movie company,

814
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
or any other thing,

815
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
and download a track,

816
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
and then play it on the radio,

817
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
without permission,

818
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
because that is not stated in the terms,

819
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
so that would be a violation.

820
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
And I think that's right,

821
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,200
although I'm sure that anyone who gets that request

822
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
will probably want their song played,

823
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
but then they also might want to consider

824
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
registering with AskCabbyMI.

825
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
So I hope that clears it up,

826
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I mean, good luck with all the items,

827
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Crapola.

828
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Hey Adam,

829
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
this is Zach from the Sounds with Einstein podcast,

830
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
that sounds with Einstein.com.

831
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
First,

832
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
I wanted to say thank you for playing my promo

833
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,200
on Delta CR at Charlie 284.

834
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
That was just really cool to hear myself

835
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
talking about my podcast on your show.

836
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
And I'm also want to thank everybody

837
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
for downloading it.

838
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I had about 200 downloads on that.

839
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
It was pretty cool.

840
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Anyway, I had a couple of questions for you.

841
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
First one,

842
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
I'm a student out here in Las Vegas.

843
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
I got a UNLV,

844
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
and I'm studying radio production

845
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
and communications.

846
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
And I want to get a job at one of the local

847
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
radio stations out here.

848
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Now, of course,

849
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
as you know,

850
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
in order to get an on-air job,

851
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
you have to send them an air check or a demo.

852
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
So I wanted to know what your opinion was

853
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
on using a podcast instead of an air check

854
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
or a demo.

855
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Fair enough.

856
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
And my second question is...

857
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Hold on, I guess I should answer that now then.

858
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
So first of all,

859
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
you're in an interesting position.

860
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
I also studied communications and radio

861
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
and broadcasting in college.

862
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
And there was nothing that I learned there

863
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
that I didn't learn much more about

864
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
while actually being on the air

865
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
at the radio station at the college.

866
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
WIT to be everybody.

867
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
We're in Debonghits.

868
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Let's see, I'm college.

869
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Salem West Virginia.

870
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
The rhythm of West Virginia.

871
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
10 watts.

872
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Son up to sunrise.

873
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Sunrise to sunset is what I'm in.

874
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Now, I wouldn't use it.

875
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
I would not use it as an air check

876
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,200
because you're talking about two different worlds.

877
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
There's no way.

878
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
If you've never seen Howard Stern's movie

879
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
check it out.

880
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
There's a certain point

881
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
when Howard Stern gets hired at WMBC in New York

882
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
and the program director

883
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
brilliantly played, by the way, in this movie.

884
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Calls Howard into his offices.

885
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
He says, look man, you're not saying the call

886
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
that it's right.

887
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
It's got to be WIN!

888
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
But he'll see.

889
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
And then he'll Howard's going to put in

890
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
his finger in his ear going, WIN!

891
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
WIN!

892
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
And it's true.

893
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
So you're not going to like it.

894
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
You're just not going to like it.

895
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I think that you're in a unique, unique position

896
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,200
and situation to use what's being taught.

897
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
And I'm sure there's a lot of audio skills

898
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
and management skills.

899
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Use that for your podcast.

900
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Get the podcast cranking.

901
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Forget about the local radio station.

902
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
I think you're really not going to like it.

903
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Certainly not.

904
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
If you've witnessed the freedoms of podcast

905
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
and you are not going to enjoy it.

906
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,200
But of course, then you could do a podcast.

907
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,200
About becoming a radio DJ and talk about the differences.

908
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
That could be interesting.

909
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
But I would not suggest using your air check.

910
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Your podcast is an air check.

911
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,200
If you don't care about getting the job,

912
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
sure, let's see what he says.

913
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
But I think you do care.

914
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
So you probably want to give them what they want to hear.

915
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,200
But not let them know about your secondary agenda.

916
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Oh, shoot.

917
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
I'm sorry.

918
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I wanted to continue playing.

919
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Oh, my God.

920
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Hey Adam, this is Zach from the Sounds of the Einstein.

921
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
I think pod safe music.

922
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Okay.

923
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Instead of an air check or demo.

924
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Second part of his question.

925
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Fair enough.

926
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
And my second question is,

927
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
what do you think about playing pod safe music on the radio?

928
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,200
I know that you already do that on pod show, on serious.

929
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I'm talking about terrestrial based radio.

930
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Do you think it's a good idea?

931
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Do you think it's a bad idea?

932
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
And if somebody were to want to do that,

933
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
how would they go about doing it?

934
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Should they just download the song and play it on the radio?

935
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Or should they contact the artists and get their permission?

936
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Anyway, so those are the only two questions I got.

937
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Other than that, I invite everybody to listen to my podcast.

938
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Sounds with Einstein.

939
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
It sounds with Einstein.com.

940
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,200
I talk about local vagus news and construction updates and events

941
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
and stuff that go on around here,

942
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,200
as well as I'm playing music from the pod safe music network.

943
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,200
And local artists from Las Vegas,

944
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,200
as you know that there's a incredible music scene out here,

945
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
because of all the musicians that are in all the shows.

946
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,200
And I got a couple of CDs from guys that are in the blue man group production.

947
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200
And all that.

948
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,200
It's some of the most amazing music I have ever heard.

949
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
So I invite everybody to check that out.

950
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Sounds with Einstein.com.

951
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
And thanks for listening.

952
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
My name is Jack.

953
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Okay, actually for a second there,

954
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,200
I thought you'd found a bug in the terms of the pod safe music network.

955
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,200
And then I realized we don't actually play individual songs on serious.

956
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Serious is a collection of pod cast that already exist in which songs are included,

957
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
which is a collective works.

958
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,200
So we're actually playing pod cast and not pod safe tunes by themselves.

959
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,200
So you heard my comment earlier to,

960
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,200
to what's his name again.

961
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
So you know,

962
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
probably not a good idea,

963
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
but contact the artist and ask him,

964
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
then it should be no problem at all if they say yes,

965
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
and maybe even say,

966
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,200
hey, can you hold on just a second or two until I get registered with Ask AppDMI?

967
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Makes a lot of sense.

968
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh, man.

969
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Excuse me.

970
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Enough talking, hey.

971
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Let's, yeah, yeah, let's play some Christmas music.

972
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
I'm not going to play if every day we're Christmas,

973
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,200
because that's getting plenty of pod play.

974
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,200
But I found this one that I really like very much.

975
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
Beatrice Erickson.

976
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,200
This is Christmas without you on the source code.

977
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Look and through my window the snow is falling down.

978
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:32,200
If only I could find a way to turn back time.

979
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,200
All those colored lights reminds me of you.

980
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:48,200
We sure could find a way to make it through.

981
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Not alone in night without you,

982
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,200
this crystal.

983
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Now the stars fall down.

984
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,200
This Christmas.

985
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,200
So much cooler now than I do.

986
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Let you spend my Christmas without you.

987
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Christmas without you.

988
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Silent memories in a silent night.

989
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Takes me back to days gone by.

990
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Used to love this time of gear when I had you.

991
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:01,200
I wish I find a way to make it through.

992
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Not alone in night without you,

993
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,200
this Christmas.

994
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Now the stars fall down.

995
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,200
This Christmas.

996
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,200
So much cooler now than I do.

997
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:35,200
But you spend my Christmas without you.

998
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:44,200
I wish I find a way to make it through.

999
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Not alone in night without you,

1000
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,200
this Christmas.

1001
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Now the stories fall down.

1002
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:04,200
This Christmas.

1003
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,200
This Christmas.

1004
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:16,200
Now the stars fall down.

1005
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:24,200
This Christmas.

1006
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,200
This Christmas.

1007
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,200
So much cooler now than I do.

1008
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:44,200
But you spend my Christmas without you.

1009
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Without you.

1010
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Beatrice Ericsson.

1011
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Christmas without you from the Podsave Music Network.

1012
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,200
You find it at Podsave Music Network.com.

1013
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Over the weekend I told you I was doing a lot of reflecting.

1014
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,200
I read a lot of interesting comments on the web about me.

1015
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,200
I think that analyzing all that.

1016
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,200
There's a lot of benefit that I got from reading a lot of the comments.

1017
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,200
I've kind of slipped into a very old bad habit.

1018
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Due to the fact that these days,

1019
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,200
the daily source code is Simulcast on a serious satellite radio.

1020
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Stars 103.

1021
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,200
So you had the Howard Stern channels and then we're next,

1022
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,200
which is I think very cool because I know that we're picking up a lot of listeners.

1023
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
People going for Howard Stern,

1024
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,200
hitting the button to change the channel once and then dropping into either the source code.

1025
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
But probably more interesting for that audience,

1026
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,200
specific host hell way,

1027
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,200
Mads Weinstein,

1028
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Don and Drew.

1029
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,200
And we have many more on the show.

1030
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,200
But for that reason, I've been making the show 48 minutes and 30 seconds.

1031
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
Or alternatively 49 minutes.

1032
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,200
And what happens is the variable in making the time work.

1033
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,200
And this is how you do it on the radio is you kind of pattern your speech.

1034
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,200
And what you're talking about to fit into the time slots that you've allowed yourself.

1035
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,200
So you can still get to everything that you lined up.

1036
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,200
You know what?

1037
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
That sucks because I drop stuff.

1038
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I forget to talk about things.

1039
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
I don't take the time.

1040
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
So in about 10 seconds, the show on serious will end.

1041
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:28,200
And you will be greeted by Mark Yoshimoto-Nemkoff and the specific host health players in specific host hell way.

1042
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,200
So enjoy that.

1043
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,200
And those of you who are listening to the podcast.

1044
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Yes, you get all the juicy bits.

1045
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Exactly.

1046
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,200
Also, what I've decided is out of the hundreds,

1047
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,200
and the thousands of audio comments and promos.

1048
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Just go look at promos.potshow.com where people actually take the time to register and upload and then post their promo online.

1049
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
There's, you know, there's tons there.

1050
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Just imagine how many people fire me off and email with an MP3 file attached.

1051
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,200
So I think that most of the time, although it's hard, you miss a lot.

1052
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,200
They do scroll by and you can miss them.

1053
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:20,200
And please, your subject line in any email is the most important advertisement you can make for getting it read to anybody on any email system.

1054
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,200
I'm going to become very, very selective.

1055
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,200
It used to be where, you know, it was kind of like almost a non-democratic thing.

1056
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,200
You know, it's like, okay, I'll grab the first four here.

1057
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,200
And I found look at the time lengths and listen to them a little bit.

1058
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,200
And then really, I like to respond to them in real time on the air.

1059
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,200
But I just don't think that works anymore.

1060
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,200
So I'm really going to do a lot of screening for the promos stuff that I like.

1061
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,200
You know, I think it'll be relevant or something that promotes something that's new.

1062
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,200
It won't just be random promos, which, believe it or not, is kind of what I've been doing.

1063
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,200
Because just to grab stuff and get as many promos out as possible.

1064
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,200
But I think that does hurt the quality and the listening experience.

1065
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
Okay.

1066
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Big story in the financial times this morning here in the UK,

1067
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,200
that cable system NTL is going to acquire virgin mobile.

1068
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,200
870 million pounds, I think, so it was at $1.5 billion.

1069
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,200
And the paper here, but the funny thing in it,

1070
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
and you, I've talked about virgin mobile extensively.

1071
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,200
In fact, I checked this morning, my phone is still blocked.

1072
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,200
You know, it's still unusable after I dealt with customer service for a week and then finally gave up and despair.

1073
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,200
And I went to team mobile.

1074
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,200
The funny thing was, is that it said something to the effect of NTL is so historically bad at customer service.

1075
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,200
They really need the virgin brand to help them drop it off.

1076
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,200
Oh my god, if you have a voting share in this top, that's not true.

1077
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Virgin mobile is, you know, is a horrible customer service.

1078
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,200
At least from my experience, and that's well documented.

1079
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Virgin Atlantic, fantastic, love it, but not virgin mobile.

1080
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,200
My god, something else that I've been reading a lot about now is that Tevo,

1081
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
the service, is offering podcasts.

1082
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:10,200
They have a module that I believe only the newest or latest edition of the Tevo boxes can handle.

1083
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,200
And I don't know if they have their directory or what they're sucking in.

1084
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,200
If anyone has any info on that, please let me know.

1085
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,200
It sounds very exciting.

1086
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Because primarily, I'd say, for video podcasts, because, you know, that's what's going to be.

1087
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,200
That's what I'm enjoying so much about that front row stuff that that software that comes now with the new iMac G5s.

1088
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,200
I use it almost exclusively for video podcasts because you can use the remote control.

1089
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,200
And just, you know, boom, you go into a podcast.

1090
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,200
I actually have a playlist set up and it just, oh, that doesn't work, right?

1091
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
It doesn't.

1092
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Hello?

1093
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,200
I see fingers.

1094
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Hey, baby.

1095
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,200
Hi.

1096
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
You coming or are going?

1097
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
No, no, no.

1098
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
I just want to give you a couple of stems that I have.

1099
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
Stamps.

1100
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
So you can do your.

1101
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
Oh, God.

1102
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,200
I hate that so much.

1103
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
No, you do.

1104
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
How many of you get me?

1105
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
No, these are only four.

1106
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Not get you.

1107
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Four.

1108
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
I need like 20.

1109
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
These were in my desk downstairs.

1110
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Okay.

1111
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
You're going to get more.

1112
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
I'm going to get you more.

1113
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,200
Thank you, hun.

1114
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,200
That's it.

1115
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Okay.

1116
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,200
That's it.

1117
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Tell them that I have a call again.

1118
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Oh, if you show the first defense.

1119
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,200
It doesn't work.

1120
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,200
The nose spray we talked about.

1121
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,200
Yeah.

1122
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,200
It doesn't work.

1123
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,200
No.

1124
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,200
It can't help.

1125
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,200
It just can't help you.

1126
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,200
Oh, God.

1127
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,200
I'm going to talk.

1128
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
Please come close to the microphone.

1129
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,200
Super Margaret for example.

1130
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,200
Oh, man.

1131
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
We watched.

1132
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,200
You know those.

1133
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
We went shopping Saturday.

1134
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Yeah.

1135
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,200
And we didn't hear a guy.

1136
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Yeah.

1137
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
People sneak.

1138
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
And we're looking at each other and we think.

1139
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Uh huh.

1140
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
How many meters?

1141
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,200
27 meters.

1142
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,200
27 meters.

1143
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,200
The spray.

1144
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
Yeah.

1145
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
That's the sketch.

1146
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
So high.

1147
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,200
I do anything.

1148
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
You know, I eat a lot of vitamins.

1149
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,200
It just doesn't help.

1150
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
It's not that I'm sick.

1151
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,200
But it's so annoying.

1152
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,200
Yeah.

1153
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Oh, very annoying.

1154
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Especially because you had the whole photo shoot so you were tired.

1155
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Yeah.

1156
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,200
And then that she says jumps on you.

1157
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah.

1158
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Yeah.

1159
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
After that boom.

1160
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Boom.

1161
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,200
Okay.

1162
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,200
Well, so far you're doing okay.

1163
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
You're doing better.

1164
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Yeah.

1165
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,200
And we're going to London tomorrow.

1166
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Yes.

1167
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,200
We are going to see the Christmas light.

1168
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,200
Yes.

1169
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,200
I went to London.

1170
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,200
I told Patricia that it was beautiful.

1171
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,200
We never go.

1172
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,200
But we do go now and then because we went for, you know, a couple of weeks.

1173
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,200
We're going to have a train ride.

1174
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Yeah.

1175
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,200
That's fun.

1176
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Very romantic.

1177
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,200
Yeah.

1178
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,200
We're going to have tea.

1179
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,200
And it's interesting.

1180
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,200
Interesting.

1181
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,200
Interesting.

1182
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
How last night could Patricia kind of turned this into a.

1183
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Yeah.

1184
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,200
And we're going to all kinds of great clothes for you.

1185
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
I'm like, wait a minute.

1186
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,200
Did I just get rangled in the clothes shopping for me?

1187
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
No.

1188
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,200
I don't think so.

1189
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
Oh, you hate it.

1190
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Oh, God.

1191
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
I don't care.

1192
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,200
I just really don't care.

1193
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,200
And I know I remember in Holland people was thinking that you.

1194
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
You are such a cool guy.

1195
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,200
You always wear it.

1196
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,200
He's wearing this, you know, the right clothes and the right hair.

1197
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
And he's so vain.

1198
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Not.

1199
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,200
No.

1200
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,200
That is that is just the.

1201
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Absolutely not you.

1202
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
That is the aura you built up around me.

1203
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Well, you know, if you do you performance on TV or you.

1204
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Yeah.

1205
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
You're a parent.

1206
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,200
You have to look good.

1207
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
And I always say, you know, where this.

1208
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
Where that.

1209
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
But I know that you are absolutely.

1210
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Absolutely.

1211
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
Not interested.

1212
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,200
That's correct.

1213
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
Yeah.

1214
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Although I must say that when you're charming guy.

1215
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Well, thank you.

1216
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
Yeah.

1217
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
Thank you.

1218
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,200
Natural charm.

1219
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,200
Natural charm.

1220
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,200
Okay.

1221
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Okay.

1222
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Go ahead.

1223
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Thank you.

1224
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,200
I love you.

1225
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,200
All right.

1226
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Bye.

1227
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
The depudations.

1228
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
The runners podcast.

1229
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Steve runner.com.

1230
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,200
Folks.

1231
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,200
Something tells me that the first mouse trap wasn't designed to catch mice at all.

1232
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,200
But to protect the cheese from burglars.

1233
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Steve runner.com.

1234
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
opinion.

1235
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
There is nothing.

1236
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
So tragic.

1237
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,200
As seeing a family pull the part.

1238
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,200
By something as simple as a pack of wolves.

1239
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Steve runner.com.

1240
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Observation.

1241
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,200
You know, it takes a big man to cry.

1242
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,200
But it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man.

1243
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,200
Steve runner.com.

1244
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
And rambling guy.

1245
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,200
So I'm not afraid of insects taking over the world.

1246
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,200
It would take about a billion ants just to aim a gun at me.

1247
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
Little little fiery.

1248
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,200
And you know what I'm doing while they're aiming at me.

1249
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,200
I'm slipping off to the side.

1250
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,200
And then kicking the gun out of their hands.

1251
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
From holes to during distance.

1252
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
Long, long.

1253
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,200
I'm Steve runner.

1254
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
And if you love to run.

1255
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
I'm training for a roader.

1256
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
It's your marathon.

1257
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,200
And have a need for filling your iPod or MP3 player.

1258
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,200
And even worse than static.

1259
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,200
Then subscribe to Fitbitations.

1260
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200

You'll hear me each week.

1263
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,200
It's I trained for my next marathon.

1264
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
Running out of breath through the back roads.

1265
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
It's central Massachusetts.

1266
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,200
We'll talk about running training in the injuries that spite us.

1267
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,200
As I'm out.

1268
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,200
I might be getting long runs.

1269
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Listen in as a middle-aged middle of the pack.

1270
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,200
Slightly asmatic distance runner.

1271
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Hits the glycogen law.

1272
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
Mumbling incomprehensibly.

1273
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,200
As he wonders aloud.

1274
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Exactly what the hell I'm doing out here.

1275
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,200

Running.

1280
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,200

And I wanted to do kind of a

1287
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,200
Translation of the official ad in the spirit of truth and advertising.

1288

Instead of computers using you.

1336
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,200
Merry Christmas from Cape Town Stripes at Cape Town Stripes.com.

1337
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:14,200
America has fallen in love with distorted view daily.

Well, I guarantee you you just show that they first amendment rise.

1340
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Haven't been listening to the show.

1341
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Here's what you've been missing.

1342
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,200
She's over his stuffed anus.

1343
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,200
He topped it with a cherry tomato.

1344
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Nice.

1345
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,200
This is the plural of cactus cacti.

1346
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Do not anchor the dark lord by correcting him.

1347
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,200
But actually think you're right.

1348
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,200
I think he is cacti.

1349
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,200
I can fly higher than an eagle hairy boasted.

1350
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,200
I've also got a ten inch uncut cock to fuck the shit out of

1351
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,200

And there's Harry fucking the shid out of thorny ass bitches.

1353
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,200
You were just having cyber sex with a 14 year old girl.

1354
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,200
You know what that makes you that makes you a pedophile.

1355
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,200
I'm, I'm, I'm meets the skypeer.

1356
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,200
All right, and that's punishable by law.

1357
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Hello.

1358
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Over 220 shows later and I'm still acting like a complete jackass.

1359
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,200
To start a few celebrates it's one year birth day next week.

1360
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200

It's ten minutes of your life you'll never get back.

1365
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
More like 20 minutes really.

1366

1370
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
We were doing so well up until that point.

1371

A happy birthday with your one year anniversary.

1377
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:05,200
I'm subscribed to this podcast, which is a video podcast called Crooks and Liars.

1378
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,200
And I'm shoot man.

1379
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,200
I'm now I'm looking for this video that I found.

1380
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
I don't know why it's not showing up here.

1381
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,200
Hold on.

1382
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,200
Just go for the whole thing.

1383
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,200
And it was a piece of video from.

1384
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,200
Gosh darn it.

1385
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,200
No, I don't have it.

1386
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,200
I don't get it.

1387
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,200
Wait, maybe this is it.

1388
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,200
Let me see.

1389
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,200
This could be it.

1390
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,200
Hold on.

1391
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
I'm not a good authority to be honest.

1392
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Not about a run.

1393
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Well, I wonder if I should.

1394
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Well, okay.

1395
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
This makes it horrible that I don't remember.

1396
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Stop.

1397
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,200
The quiet.

1398
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,200
Stop.

1399
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
Stop.

1400
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
Thank you.

1401
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,200
Okay.

1402
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,200
The point of what it was.

1403
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
It was a reporter who was in the field in Iraq.

1404
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
I guess he was still in Iraq and he was on the phone.

1405
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,200
He was being asked about President Bush's claim that there were, and I'm just paraphrasing.

1406
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I don't know the exact facts anymore.

1407
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:03,200
About 40 Iraqi units on the front line fighting side by side with the US forces.

1408
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,200
And this guy said, hey, look, I was there at the time.

1409
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,200
And I don't know if this was a year ago or a month ago or a week ago.

1410
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,200
He said, but, you know, those, those, the Iraqi guys are, you know, not at all fighting side by side.

1411
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,200
They're being told what to do, the green berets are in charge.

1412
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,200
And he really was discrediting the Iraqi forces.

1413
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,200
Okay.

1414
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:34,200
So having been there and having received the grand tour by the Dutch Marines, they took me around

1415
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:44,200
to several different camps where Iraqi soldiers, or to be precise the ICDC, the Iraqi civil defense coalition.

1416
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,200
I think that's what it stands for.

1417
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,200
And the Iraqi police were being trained.

1418
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,200
Now, this was February of 2004.

1419
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,200
So we're coming up on two years.

1420
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,200
And I'm not quite sure how long they had been training them.

1421
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,200
You know, so the claim is, hey, they ran these guys through three or four weeks of training and then they're good to go.

1422
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Now, I don't know what boot camp is for for US Marines and US, quote, security forces.

1423
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,200
But when we were there, we received several demonstrations.

1424
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:18,200
And I have to say that, I don't know if you remember the series, Dad's Army.

1425
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,200
It was very much like Dad's Army.

1426
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,200
You know, someone would call a right face and then half of them would turn left and half of them would turn right.

1427
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,200
And then they were reloading their.

1428
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:36,200
So the drill, the drill sergeants in front of all the troops, and then the command was to reload their AK-47s.

1429
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,200
And like, you know, they're like pointing the thing in him and throwing magazines in and out.

1430
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,200
And everyone's freaking out about how unsafe that was.

1431
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:52,200
So I don't know, but two years certainly, two years ago, I was not at all impressed by the Iraqi forces at all.

1432
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:58,200
And I think that if they kept on training that way for two years, well, they certainly must be good enough to participate.

1433
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,200
They all seemed dedicated. That's for sure. And they had their own ranks within the leadership of the men.

1434
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:08,200
And they were, I thought they looked like damn good soldiers, just.

1435
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:15,200
They, they certainly weren't by, by no means, as far as I'm concerned, ready to go into combat to win.

1436
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
What to do anything effective.

1437
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,200
So I just wanted to, you know, spin that back since, since I actually was there.

1438
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:31,200
And like I say, I'd have to know a little bit more about what, what missions President Bush was talking about, but certainly two years ago, no freaking way.

1439
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
All right.

1440
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,200
One more song.

1441
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,200
Oh, I feel so good about doing this. Now the show was balanced.

1442
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,200
I can end with a song and it will be done.

1443
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,200
And it's not a Christmas song.

1444
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,200
Yeah.

1445
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,200
This is a hollow horse, beggars town.

1446
01:03:49,200 --> 01:04:02,200
I've become what I'm most despised, even I believe.

1447
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Oh, my old eyes, but I've fooled no one.

1448
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:17,200
Now I'm biting my old tongue.

1449
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,200
I'm not off the right.

1450
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,200
But once again, I'm wrong.

1451
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,200
So good to blame on me.

1452
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,200
It doesn't matter anymore.

1453
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:41,200
You say the damage has been done.

1454
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:48,200
I see I love what's already flowed.

1455
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,200
In beggars town.

1456
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
No love this matches.

1457
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,200
In beggars town.

1458
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:09,200
In beggars town.

1459
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,200
In beggars town.

1460
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,200
In beggars town.

1461
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,200
In beggars town.

1462
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:26,200
Everything I'm though and love.

1463
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,200
I was hoping I could forget.

1464
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,200
You are a mealist to me now.

1465
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,200
There's no cure and I'm addicted to you yet.

1466
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Who can I depend upon?

1467
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:49,200
To get me out of this.

1468
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,200
You've got this sweetest smile.

1469
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Can such a part of this kiss.

1470
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:03,200
My hands are shaking with rage.

1471
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,200
It's too late now to negotiate.

1472
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,200
For all the love that's turned to hate.

1473
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,200
And it seeks without a trace.

1474
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,200
Oh, the blame on me.

1475
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,200
It doesn't matter anymore.

1476
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,200
Because I've been here so many times before.

1477
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:35,200
I feel ill and I'm heart sore.

1478
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,200
In beggars town.

1479
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,200
No love this matches.

1480
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,200
In beggars town.

1481
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,200
In beggars town.

1482
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,200
In beggars town.

1483
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,200
In beggars town.

1484
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,200
In beggars town.

1485
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,200
So this is what we are.

1486
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,200
And this is what we've been through.

1487
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:21,200
I've been nothing left to give.

1488
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,200
I keep everything I has to you.

1489
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,200
Be yourself.

1490
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,200
Be yourself.

1491
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,200
Be yourself.

1492
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,200
Be yourself.

1493
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,200
In beggars town.

1494
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,200
In beggars town.

1495
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,200
In beggars town.

1496
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:05,200
In beggars town.

1497
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:12,200
In beggars town.

1498
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,200
In beggars town.

1499
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,200
In beggars town.

1500
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,200
It's like a minute.

1501
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,200
It's a surf, I'm just a swimming pool.

1502
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:33,200
So, around the long podcast for today, what is it now or an eight minutes?

1503
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:41,160
Just because we're going to ignore the serious 48.5 mark, doesn't mean that they're all

1504
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
going to be this long.

1505
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,960
Just on a Monday there's so much to talk about, so many things that happen over the weekend.

1506
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,240
So they may even be shorter, which I think is also good, and then what we'll do on

1507
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:56,640
serious is we'll fill that up with Podsake music, so that we maintain the absolute

1508
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,720
highest quality possible for the podcast.

1509
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,560
Alright, daily source code.com is where you can find the latest episodes and the podcast

1510
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,520
feed, at amacurry.com for all your feedback.

1511
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,400
And of course, there's promo.podshow.com.

1512
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,400
We can upload your promo.

1513
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:19,920
Still need some holiday greetings, because I just need more as many as possible for the

1514
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,960
Christmas Podshow podcast at xmus.podshow.com, so you can upload those there as well.

1515
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:32,960
And I'll meet you back here tomorrow for another edition of the daily source code.

1516
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,480
There we go.

1517
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,040
I'd say that was a pretty successful broadcast.
