1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Delta Sierra Charly 2...4...4...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass...

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
...than the next generation radio content in my ears.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We don't need no thinking, can we?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I like to think I'm flying you to the future.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It is Thursday the 22nd of September, good morning from Northern California.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Once again, coming to you from the Curry Condo, how you doing?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, I've got my regime set now.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here's how it works every single morning.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Eyes awake just before the alarm clock goes off.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Because light streaming into the room.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do some email on the blackberry, and then get ready for this or else go.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So freaking sad, then.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I swear to God, I wake up and like, let me just check my messages.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I think I'm actually getting better in my email, though.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, let's see, it's 9.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's about 9 a.m. here in the condo in San Francisco, California.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Three main topics today, which will be about the hate podcast that we discussed yesterday.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A little bit more on the sound-vertising experiments.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I actually may have four different topics.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let me regroup here.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, so that's two.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't remember what I was going to talk about.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right now we have, I think several members of the pod show family are roaming around San Francisco.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Doing sound-steens towards Will Smith is in town, doing a movie.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think that you could try to finagle their way on the sets and do stuff.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So you could get anything sent in, then I'll let definitely put it on.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If it comes in the next few minutes, of course.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, as I awakened, and your day has probably already started.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Once again, it's very, very foggy outside, and here on the 24th floor and the condo,

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the fog just kind of rolls on it, and it's a little bit gloomy, although I do know it will burn off later.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But it made me think of Patricia.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I thought I'd play one of her songs since I miss her and London too.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A foggy day in London town.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It had me low.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It had me down.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll feel the morning with much alone.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The bridges museum had lots to show.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How long I wondered, could this thing last, but the age of miracles?

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It hadn't passed, and suddenly I saw you standing right there,

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and in foggy London town, the sun was shining shining everywhere.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I thought I'd play one of her songs since I miss her and London town.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I thought I'd play one of her songs since I miss her and London town.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I thought I'd play one of her songs since I miss her and London town.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A foggy day in London town.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It had me low.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It had me down.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll feel the morning with much alone.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The bridges museum had lots to show.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How long I wondered, could this thing last, but the age of miracles?

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It hadn't passed, and suddenly I saw you standing right there,

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and in foggy London town, but the sun was shining everywhere.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Girl has some pipes.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, it gives me goosebumps.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay, that helped.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, that woke me up a little bit.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Good to hear my wife.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I only talked to her once a day, because that's why we've talked about time differences being in California.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I got to get up, I got to do my stuff, and by the time I really have,

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'd like to chat for at least half an hour, catch up on what's going on.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's already 9pm over there, and I'm still in morning, go get a mode,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and she's in winded down decompression mode.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So that's a little bit tough, but only about a week now before I'll be going back,

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and we will be, oh, there's another great song.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If I have this song, I'll play it, I'll play a snippet for you, hold on.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, I fixed iTunes, that was my other topic that I was going to talk to you about.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, I didn't really fix it, but I figured out how to make it work again.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't fix my subscriptions, those are all lost.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hold on a second, let me see if I have.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, man.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You'd think I'd have peaches in her with reunited.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now, I have peaches in her, but I don't have reunited.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What do I have?

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I have six.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, that's a shaky group thing, that doesn't count.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, so what should we talk about?

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, yeah, iTunes, let's talk about that real quick.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The coffee's brewing in the background, so I mean,

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you know, I got to talk about the sound advertising stuff.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, after installing and reading, re-installing iTunes,

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the new version 5.0.1,

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
still, it wouldn't actually even start up,

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and so I figured there must be something completely horrendously wrong

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with both the library and probably the XML file that's in the iTunes folder.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, I trashed both of those, started up again, and of course,

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
iTunes was fine, and it had to re-index my library,

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
so I lost my playlist, but that's no big, I don't care about that.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I'd already lost the subscription, so now I can start over again,

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but this time I'm pretty confident that the program is going to be stable.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I guess just for some reason, and I did actually get a couple of emails

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
saying that folks who were members of the Dutch music store,

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and you know, when I signed up for the music store,

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
actually when I signed up for my whole dot market count,

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I did it when I was still living in the Netherlands, actually.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So, never got around to changing that.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It probably isn't even a real simple way,

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and it may have something to do with the location specific music stores,

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
or the XML-associated with that, because I got a couple other reports

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that that was happening with folks who were using the Dutch music store.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So, that could be what's going on.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You actually have a meeting over at Apple, was it next week?

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll bring it up and see.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, there's some other little features that were fixed here and there.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let me see, I think I had,

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm really trying to get all my show notes together here.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh shoot, another thing we're supposed to talk about today,

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
show notes. Oh man, I had some great feedback on the show notes.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let me see, was this, here we go.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mike from British Columbia,

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mike Hilderbrand from British Columbia, Canada,

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
says that it's what was happening here.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He has iTunes that only keep the podcast.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He hasn't listened to, once he's listened to a show,

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
it gets deleted automatically next time.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh man.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can now I can't figure out what he's saying.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's okay, they fixed a lot of stuff in five.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh shoot, hold on a second.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I haven't done my milk yet, man.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hold on.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can hear that.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's me.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's the cup of chino maker getting ready to move.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Just blow some steam into it.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hold on.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh my kingdom for a set sail.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh man, this is insane.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's, it's not that the coffee isn't good.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's just that it's so fricking messy.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There we go.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Once again, we're creating burn milk in a plastic cup.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, there's some reason it's sprawl thing much better today.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How tired do you get up listening to me?

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Listen to me do this, huh?

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There we go.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Once again, totally not organized.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hold on one second.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Just let me, just let me grab this sugar.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't go away.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Here we go.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There we go.

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes fantastic.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So the reason why I'm not quite as organized

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
is I have a new system now for my email.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me talk to you about this because those of you who are using Gmail

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and really like it.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But still want to take advantage of most of the Gmail features

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and a lot of the features of the Blackberry.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
By the way, I've been getting questions about which Blackberry

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have the 7290.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's the plastic one with the, you know,

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
with the type of multiple keyboard.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I really like this device because, well, a number of reasons.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
First of all, the keyboard does not suck.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can type pretty fast with two thumbs.

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Probably not much slower.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It might even be fast.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I should judge it time that I'm not a,

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not a blind type this.

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I use probably six fingers,

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
depending on what my mood is.

165
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Never learned to type properly.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I do have to look at the keyboard once in a while.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But on the Blackberry, it goes pretty fast.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And the keys have good feedback, good response.

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So you know when you hit it,

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
there has lots of shortcuts.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know, if you want to do a capitalize letter,

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you just hold the key down and it turns into a cap real quick.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But more importantly,

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can kind of, you know, take it anywhere.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And, well, you know, why get up in the morning?

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The first thing I do is,

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
oh, just a skin through the mail.

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And because there's a limited space on the device,

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think it has 32 megs of memory or something like that.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And also the way these guys set up.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You get like a 25 megabyte email,

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
a lot meant that can go into your Blackberry,

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
which makes sense, you know,

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
10 megs for applications and crap and 25 for email.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then starts rejecting stuff.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So you kind of get into habit of clearing out the mailbox.

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And guess what?

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That means you go through it.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've actually started really reading email lists again.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So let me just tell you how I did it.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Could it might be of interest to you if you're setting that up?

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I love Gmail.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's nothing that beats Gmail when it comes to really search-based email.

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I love it.

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It works for me.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's a fantastic idea.

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The interface is great.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I never have a problem with SMTP servers or anything like that.

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Just give me a web browser.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can log in all my email addresses are there.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And it's great.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We have to besides the fact that I've never seen to be able to keep under 99%.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm always at 100% and I find myself deleting things.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But, you know, usually people who still send me MP3 files as attachments.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So what I've done is I've set up a number of rules.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
First of all, I set it up so that when I send something from the Blackberry,

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it sends a blind carbon copy to my Gmail account.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And of course, I've set up a rule that if something comes in from the Blackberry from me,

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
then it should not be forwarded back to the Blackberry.

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Otherwise, you get this interesting loop.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You just basically read in your own exhaust.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And that's a pain.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So that, that, let me see.

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So if it comes in from the Blackberry, then it does not get forwarded.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everything else does get forwarded.

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
However, if something comes in from the Blackberry that I've tagged and by tagging meaning that I've forwarded it to myself.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And I put, as an example, DSC in Caps at the end of it.

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I shouldn't have told you that, and I should I.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No way, but it only works when it's coming from me.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay, right.

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then it will automatically label it as something for the source code.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And it'll file it away.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And of course, it won't send it back to me.

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And, and everything else just gets forwarded.

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So now, as I, you know, kind of get reused to the a new way of reading email.

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And, you know, and being reintroduced to some of the mailing lists,

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm on that probably just sitting in in folders or our label,

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
then not in my inbox.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I rarely have time to go through or, you know, once in a blue moon.

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So like the podcasters mailing list.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I'm reading that again.

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And it's, it's really fast, you know, it's, it's, it's actually,

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
maybe even depending on your connectivity.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's maybe even be a little bit faster than Gmail itself.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And a great advantage is, even if you run out of space,

237
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
because when you hit 100% on your Gmail quota, you can't send email.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can, of course, still sends something from the blackberry.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And it will actually put the, the blind carbon copy into the Gmail account,

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
even though you're at 100% because I think you can go up to like 105 or 110%.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But I've got, I mean, if anyone at Google is listening anybody,

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Foo bar boy is the account,

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
F-O-O-B-A-R-B-O-Y.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm excuse me, that would be Fox Trot, Oscar,

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Bravo, Alpha Romeo, Bravo, Oscar Yankee.

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Give me, give me like two more gigs, please.

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I won't tell anyone, I'll just, you know,

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you would make my life so much better.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It would be so nice.

250
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So that's the, the setup there.

251
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm, I'm digging it.

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I, I, I never thought I would say it,

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but it's a great device.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I like it very, very much.

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Y'all, let's send a hint to hit test in,

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
so we'll definitely be rolling that one out today.

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I still have a mashup.

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I got this whole CD of like 100 different mashups from,

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
somebody I met yesterday.

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And I'll, I'll tell you about that later.

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But first, the, the Sincel stuff.

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
For some reason, I've gotten a whole slew of emails

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
about the Sincel sound,

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
advertising experiment.

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So, if you're new,

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
to the daily source code,

267
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and those of you who who already have done this,

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
you might want to skip ahead and not listen to it.

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because this is some mind programming that,

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that is, it will appears to be reasonably permanent.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So the whole concept is, you're driving right now,

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
or you're walking, or maybe you're just sitting in the,

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
on the couch and a living room,

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
wherever you are, pick a spot right now.

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Just look at that spot.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's an object, probably.

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And when I'm going to say Sincel.

278
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So every single time you see that object,

279
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you will not be able to help yourself,

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but to think of Sincel.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What's interesting, and I get a lot of emails,

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
is that it also works in the reverse.

283
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
When I talk about Sincel,

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
someone who might have picked, for instance,

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
a tree, or a particular road sign,

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
will actually think of the road sign.

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So it seems to be a, a two way street.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's something about this though,

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
that it's a little bit disturbing,

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because I don't know how to undo it.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It appears to be irreversible.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And, and I'm getting lots of email

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
of people saying, you know,

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and it doesn't bother them that much,

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
but they cannot stop thinking of the Sincel,

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
whenever they see their special object.

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I'm like, there's got this,

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and where are the psychologists out there?

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, this has got to be,

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
some kind of very simple,

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and that's a college.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This is like, this is like neural,

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
neural network programming in some regard.

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's really, it's a really easy way to,

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
to do it.

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I'm not quite sure what we're going to take this,

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but I'm just waiting for the first,

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
for the first advertiser to think,

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
this is a really good way to,

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to do something to associate their product with,

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you know,

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
anything that people want to associate it with,

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but just the message keeps on coming back.

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We just run through a couple of,

315
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
a couple of emails here about the,

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
about the Sincel,

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the soundvertising experiment.

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So we have Brendan Cops,

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
says I get the reverse.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't think of Sincel every time I pass,

321
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the fire hydrant that I picked as my object,

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
but I do think of the fire hydrant every time I hear Sincel,

323
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and here it comes.

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was listening to Dawn and Drew the other day,

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and they mentioned Sincel when Dawn Belts,

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
which used to be my anchor for the Sincel.

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
First thing I thought of was the fire hydrant.

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, fantastic.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's see,

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,080
Let's see, what's this next one here?

331
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,720
This is from Sasha.

332
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,560
I was running on Interstate 94 from Minneapolis to St. Paul to attend one of my university

333
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,360
classes while I was listening to your podcast, telling us to look at something outside

334
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,720
or window and things and say, oh, you wanted to see if each time we said the same thing,

335
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,200
do we think St. Sayo? Fuck yes. I happen to look at an overpass. Now every time I see it overpass,

336
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,600
I think St. Sayo whenever I see any overpass, I suddenly want coffee. I just need to get one of

337
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,160
those damn St. Sayo machines. Yeah, they don't, the St. Sayo machines aren't that readily available.

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,520
I don't think in the United States. So you can order one through my weblog at www.curry.com.

339
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,640
Same goes for South Africa where the sound advertising experiment is working Paul says the same thing.

340
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Don't have a, don't have a recall ever seeing it St. Sayo machine in South Africa,

341
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,280
but it's working well. He picked a cell phone tower.

342
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:17,080
It's fantastic. So let me, yeah. I got to get one. I got to have one sent over to you know,

343
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,720
where's Frick and JC pennies? They were supposed to contact me by yes. So that's another thing

344
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,200
I got to put on the list. I need my stuff. I'm still eating off a paper plates. This is ridiculous.

345
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:36,040
Okay. Yesterday we had a little conversation about the

346
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,640
listing or not listing of a racist podcast in the indie potter.org directory.

347
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,120
And we, you know, I kind of looked at it from all angles. And there's so much response. Thank you all so

348
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,240
much for for sending in your thoughts and your comments. And I would have to say that except for one email

349
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:06,040
out of easily 60 or 70. And that one email suggested or actually said, hey, look, you know,

350
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,040
indie potter.org is, you know, it's a private organization, it's not a government thing.

351
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,080
You can do it as you like. And that's not, you know, that's your prerogative. Then I agree.

352
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,800
But the other 99.9% of the emails all said, you know, indie potter.org is

353
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,200
such an important resource for all things podcasting that even though the podcast and question

354
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,000
discuss them, even though they, you know, well, just no, no one said, hey, I like that podcast,

355
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,560
right? That would make sense. I guess the no one wants to, it removed. No one wants the listing

356
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,000
removed from the, from the category, from the politics category. No one wants the politics category

357
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,280
altered. And they all feel that free speech is much more important and probably by not trying to

358
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:04,120
cover it up, it'll, you know, keep it out in the open. Yeah, excuse me. Keep it out in the open.

359
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,520
And leave the issues out there. Don't try to turn your back and look the other way. And that is proved

360
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,000
not a very good idea in, in past history. Interesting idea was to set up a

361
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,120
hate and racism node on the directory and put all, I'm put it in there. I don't know.

362
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,600
But it did, it did really strike me. There goes the jackhammer again outside. It did really strike

363
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,320
me that people view indie potter.org as a really big community resource. And they want everything

364
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,640
listed in there and don't think anything should be pulled out. So how to chat yesterday with a

365
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,320
couple of folks at Pod Show and everyone agrees. That's the way to do it. So we're going to leave

366
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:56,440
it at that. And probably we should all focus our energy on, you know, trying to stop hate and trying

367
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,920
to stop racism and, and educating our kids and our friends and our neighbors and that that's a

368
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,480
much, much better way than to just say, oh, it doesn't exist. And by the way, you know, really to

369
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,880
the block free speech, we'd have to make it, you know, have to stop them from being from talking.

370
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,920
And, you know, that is, that's, we're not doing that. This is just not publicizing something or

371
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,080
or it is publicizing something. So we're going to leave it in. We're going to leave the

372
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,320
know the way it is. And I really appreciate everyone for sending in all the comments. I did make

373
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:32,200
a big mistake, though. I said that I had to receive that rather unfriendly email from Podcast

374
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,560
shuffle. Well, let me just get to the, yeah, I haven't gotten so, of course, receive several emails

375
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,520
about that because I totally screwed it up. It was not the, the podcast shuffle. Let's see.

376
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,080
Okay, so I've discovered now that my email system is not working the way I'd like it to

377
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,360
because everything that I forward comes into my daily source code folder as coming from me.

378
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,920
So that's not very handy. Let me go to the comments on curry.com.

379
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,880
Damn, are we already into, are we even like, oh, it's 22 minutes already with the hell of

380
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I've been doing. Okay, here we go. Scrolling down. Oh, man.

381
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:27,480
Okay, so it was not the podcast shuffle. It was, it doesn't really even matter who it was.

382
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,320
But it was not the podcast shuffle who threatened to call me out if I didn't do anything

383
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,240
about the, the code situation. That doesn't matter. I do apologize now. That was, that was unintended.

384
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,440
That's just another bit of information overload and confusion. But it's even worse, though,

385
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,920
as I did look at the RSS feed for this particular podcast. It was clearly someone who would just

386
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:58,040
throw an RSS feed together and it copied and pasted someone else's RSS feed to get the right

387
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:05,320
elements in there, which is, that's a pretty standard, standard way of working, I guess, for newbies

388
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,160
who don't know how to, you know, are doing it with a, with a text or a note pad editor or something.

389
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,760
Unfortunately, in this particular podcast, I, I noticed this, I knew exactly what had happened

390
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,480
when I saw it. It was copied from the podcast for one one podcast and I know Rob has nothing to

391
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,920
do with these guys. And then so you can imagine how freaked out he is about this. He actually sent

392
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,360
an audio comment about this very topic. And this is Rob from podcast for one one. I just want to thank

393
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,960
you for letting me clarify this situation a little bit on your Wednesday, 20th first show. You mentioned

394
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:44,200
a podcast and you were talking about this podcast with regards to freedom of speech and this was

395
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,760
a white supremacy podcast and I'm not going to mention their name. I don't want to give them any

396
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,120
more PR. Earlier this week, getting of the week, I received an email from one of my listeners who

397
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,520
happened to come across this podcast and to let me know that my email address was listed under

398
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,200
their web manager. I want to let everybody know, I have absolutely nothing to do with this podcast.

399
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,280
I have never talked with them. I have never consulted with them. I have absolutely zero relationship

400
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,960
with this podcast nor would I ever have any relationship with this podcast. Once this was brought

401
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,320
to my attention, I have sent multiple emails to them now asking that my email address be removed

402
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,120
from the web manager. Hopefully, this will be rectified shortly. As you know, Adam, I have

403
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,800
tutorial on my site that teaches you how to create an RSS feed. That tutorial has been accessed

404
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,720
tens of thousands of times. And unfortunately, one of those times apparently was by this podcast

405
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,000
in question, and they copied and pasted out the demo tutorial I have and in doing so copied

406
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,040
out my email address and put that in there. Again, I have absolutely nothing to do with this podcast

407
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,520
nor would I as a point of reference. In my bio picture, I send out is a picture from my visit to Israel

408
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,960
two years ago, which was one of the best visits I've ever had. I love Israel and the people in

409
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,280
Israel. And one of my favorite podcasts is the view from here, which by the way, if you'll as

410
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,680
soon as I haven't checked out, please check out the view from here. Harry and Zeva do a wonderful job.

411
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:20,600
So again, Adam, thank you for letting me clear the record here. I have nothing and want nothing

412
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,800
to do with that podcast and have asked that my email address be removed from their feed. Thanks, Adam.

413
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,200
Okay, Rob. And thank you for clarifying not that it needed clarification from where I stand,

414
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,640
obviously, but that does really suck. Oh, man, that's horrible. Oh, no, I forgot the turn.

415
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,200
I chatted off. And of course, I immediately, you know, there's too many ways to get to me. There's

416
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,520
too many incoming subspace signals as Rev Tim was say. Okay, and it's definite. I've totally decided

417
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:55,640
now the studio A to the Audi A8. I'm getting rid of it at the end of the year. Actually, it was a

418
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,880
company least that I from one of my companies in the Netherlands still has Dutch plates on it,

419
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,320
even if you can go figure that. So the least will be up and I'm not renewing it, getting rid of it,

420
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,560
because this car is way overqualified for the mission. I don't care about cars anymore. I've had

421
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,720
every single stupid car you can imagine, except a Ferrari. I've never owned a Ferrari, but I've had

422
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,640
roses, I've had porches, I've had clunkers, I've had, you know, you name it, I've probably had it at

423
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,760
one point in time, even if I couldn't afford it, because I've always loved, you know, wow, we're all

424
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,280
behind the different cars, but I kind of give up on it and I really like the car service, the

425
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,440
cab service that we use in Guilford, which is GM cars. In case you're in Guilford and looking for a

426
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,680
good car service, tell a Mr. Mrs. Curry sent you. You know, they're very trustworthy and those are

427
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:47,160
just great guys. So we use the car service most of the time, but once in a while, you need to

428
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,920
go somewhere or have your own wheels under your own control, so we do need a car. And I've decided

429
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:00,040
it's definitely definitely definitely going to be a diesel, and I want, and over the course of the

430
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,400
past four or five weeks, maybe even longer, we'd talk about the concept of biodiesel. This is not

431
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,400
ethanol or anything like that. This is pure oil from different sources that you can make a diesel

432
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,960
engine run on. Garrett was nice enough to send me an email about some article about this guy in the

433
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,440
UK who bought a really kind of like a what a pleasure wasn't it? Yeah, a pleasure to owe five

434
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:33,480
diesel, and he figured out how to create a biodiesel from on the second, from the chip shop.

435
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:44,040
Yes, that would be from the, the used up, I guess French right, Greece. And it cost him a total

436
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,480
of 50 cents a liter. So that would be about a buck 50 a gallon, I guess. I'm just doing rough estimates here.

437
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,280
He says it costs about a thousand dollars a year through on his car, which of course depends on,

438
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,480
you know, how far he's, how far he's driving. We made a little processor in this shed from

439
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,400
from an old heating boiler, and he says that the the waste vegetable oil that he gets from the

440
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,520
kebab van. So these are vans that drive from bacon up kebab. They're so happy with him. They actually

441
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,080
drop it off at his house. And I would like to do a project like this because, you know, if I don't

442
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,240
have to use oil from the pump and I can make it, I mean, it's more about the principle of it than

443
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,280
the actual price, but I want to do this. So if you know which car I should get, so I do want to

444
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:37,720
luxury car, and I want it to be a nice vehicle, you know, that can kind of conceit, well, it has to

445
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,440
have back seats. That's, that's a must. And something that, and now, lots of people send me

446
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,680
different information about that, you know, these newer diesel engines can or can't handle that.

447
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,680
And, you know, there's got to be so many who has the definitive answer. I just want an example.

448
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,520
Give me an example of a car you have that is running on vegetable oil, and I'm going to go get it,

449
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,520
and I'm going to make my own goddamn vegetable oil. I'm going to run it on it, and we'll make

450
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,720
that a project that will, that will be doing together. How does that sound? So yesterday at the

451
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,840
Pod Show offices, I met up with Christina, or actually Christy, as she goes, she's a publicist,

452
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,040
here in San Francisco. We're talking about working together, and she's a big fan of podcasting

453
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,480
and pod safe music, and she handed me a CD, and she said, well, this is a guy who doesn't really

454
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:30,200
want to be known, and the CD just said boots on it. That's all it said. 113 different mixes and

455
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,480
mash-ups. I kind of like this one as I was spitting them all last night here at the condo.

456
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,200
It's the dreadlock child on the source code, 244.

457
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,960
about this, try to control me when you get this mess, and my own condo, and I pay my own bills,

458
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,760
I always think they've their relationships, shoes on my beat, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it,

459
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:42,760
I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I

460
00:30:42,760 --> 00:31:12,760
I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I wear it, I

461
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:24,760
wear it, I wear it, I say, you know, no no, no, you don't know, now, talk about this, whatever.

462
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
The house that I live in

463
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
I want the car I'm driving

464
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
I want the car that I live in

465
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
I want the car that I live in

466
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
The house that I live in

467
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
I want the car that I live in

468
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
I want the car that I live in

469
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
I want the car that I live in

470
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I want the car that I live in

471
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
I want the car that I live in

472
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I want the car that I live in

473
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I want the car that I live in

474
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
I want the car that I live in

475
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
I want the car that I live in

476
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
I want the car that I live in

477
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
I want the car that I live in

478
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
I want the car that I live in

479
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
I want the car that I live in

480
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I want the car that I live in

481
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
I want the car that I live in

482
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,760
I want the car that I live

483
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,760
I want the car that I live in

484
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I want the car that I live in

485
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,760
I want the car that I live in

486
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
I want the car that I live in

487
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

488
00:32:50,760 --> 00:33:14,440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, go get that, like that,IIin, flavorful Scoop bloody

489
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,440
There is no such thing.

490
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Now there is the appeal.

491
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Lindy's blues cast brings in the best blues music in the world.

492
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Is it acoustic or electronic?

493
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Or electronic?

494
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Lindy's blues cast brings in the best blues.

495
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Rightly influenced in RSS feed 50g on top.

496
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Lindy's podcast called Rockspot.com

497
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
That's Lindy's blues cast from Germany.

498
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Lindy's blues cast.blogspot.com.

499
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,440
And I play that because I often get emails.

500
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,440
People say, hey, you know, the source code makes it sound like podcasting.

501
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,440
It's a US thing only and there's lots of podcasts all over the place.

502
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
A global concept.

503
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Of course it is.

504
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
But I rarely play a promo in a different language.

505
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I think you kind of get the gist of that one, right?

506
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
That was easy enough if you don't speak German.

507
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,440
But let me tell you, my theory on why podcasting is so incredibly huge in the United States.

508
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,440
And it doesn't seem to be catching on as fast with the same,

509
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,440
a mine, you know, same in scenery speed as in the US.

510
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
And that is, and it's my theory only.

511
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,440
But I think it's right is because listening has sucked.

512
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,440
It started to suck in the United States.

513
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
The radio is the problem.

514
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
This thing, this podcasting that we're all, you know,

515
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,440
freaking out about and having so much fun with is driven by listener demand.

516
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Because the radio in the United States became this,

517
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
you know, that's what cruise box is singing about.

518
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,440
It became this homogenized, marketed, playlisted, scripted, you know,

519
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
tight, formatted thing.

520
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,440
And no matter where you go anywhere in the United States,

521
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
you turn on the radio and you have your formats.

522
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Now the most exciting format is the Jack format,

523
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,440
which is pretty much someone putting their iPod on shuffle

524
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
and plugging it into a transmitter.

525
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,440
But then there's the, you know, the WLTW light FM.

526
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
You know, there's that station.

527
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
There's the rocket flight drone.

528
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
See you 100.

529
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,440
And then, of course, there's the news back to you, Bob.

530
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
And no matter where you go, it's the same.

531
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,440
And this is one of the things we talked about the very, very beginning of podcasting

532
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
before we had the word podcasting,

533
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
is that all those voices are fake.

534
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,440
That's, you know, those are all broadcast voices.

535
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,440
And, you know, it's, it's part of a machine.

536
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
That's okay.

537
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
It's not a problem.

538
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
But there's almost no even public radio

539
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
doesn't do us justice anymore.

540
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
And it's the same.

541
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
It's actually, it's the, you have the NPR voices.

542
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,440
So I think that's part of what the excitement is about.

543
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,440
It's just all this fresh new voices, people talking like real people

544
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,440
with all the warts and all the ugliness hanging off of the shows.

545
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
It's, it's a human thing.

546
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
And maybe we're just, you know, maybe it's just time for it.

547
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Maybe our brains have been overloaded.

548
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Now in many other countries, radio doesn't suck as bad.

549
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,440
The UK, for instance,

550
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,440
was a very nice, you know, community of podcasters.

551
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,440
I believe that the, of course, I missed it because I was here.

552
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
It was the podcast con UK.

553
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
It was very, very successful.

554
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
I know they had well over 100 podcasters come to the convention.

555
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,440
You know, that was, it was a big success.

556
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,440
But it's not, you know, it's not the same rampantness

557
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
that we see here in the States.

558
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
And that's because the BBC doesn't suck.

559
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
They do great stuff.

560
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,440
And even though they, they do have the, you know, the radio voices,

561
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,440
they're just so much more creative in what they're doing with radio.

562
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And it's not all the same.

563
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
And also, you know, there are those, of course,

564
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,440
there's the time shifting element that's a part of podcasting,

565
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
which is very exciting.

566
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
So if there's a show that you like on the radio,

567
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
nothing wrong with it.

568
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
And it doesn't have to suck.

569
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
And now you can listen to it whenever you want to.

570
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
So that's all good news.

571
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Germany, same way.

572
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
You know, the rate well.

573
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
I don't know. I think that some parts of Germany,

574
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
I am seeing a little blip of podcasting.

575
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Oh, man, someone sent me a Google map.

576
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I'll have to look for that in Gmail.

577
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Someone sent me a Google map, which listed,

578
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,440
which showed by geography where the podcasters are.

579
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
And it really gives you a good idea.

580
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
And if you know anything about, about traditional terrestrial broadcast radio,

581
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,440
you'll know that most of those countries, the radio really sucks.

582
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
So it's a listener demand thing.

583
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
This is different from web logs.

584
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,440
The inherent desire and opportunity to publish for free,

585
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,440
so that everybody can read you and read your opinion.

586
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Yes, of course.

587
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
People are opinionated on podcasts and are passionate about topics

588
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
that hear nothing about on the radio.

589
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
And that's why they're making them.

590
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,440
The reason why people are listening is because it's just bad.

591
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Go ahead, turn on the radio.

592
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Tell me it isn't different.

593
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Any market you go to.

594
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Tell me your radio station is different.

595
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Well, it's there, probably, but it really is in the minority.

596
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,440
And here in the States, we have such wonderful inventions

597
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,440
that we can talk about in podcasting, such as wrestling.

598
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Yes.

599
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Am I on?

600
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Hi Adam, this is wiggly.

601
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Yeah, I am.

602
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
No, it's not.

603
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Well, yeah, it is.

604
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
It's really wiggly, but I don't really talk like...

605
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Open mind.

606
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Hi Adam and Adam's listeners and me,

607
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
because I listen to Adam.

608
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Hi Adam.

609
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
This is wiggly.

610
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,440
My buddy, Joe and I might let me start over.

611
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
This is going to be terrible to edit.

612
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
This is now snow.

613
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,440
This is sweet and sour, Larry.

614
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
We need to visit this one for now.

615
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,440
And you're looking at your smart, wrestling fan.com.

616
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440

we see on television, paper views,

622
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
or live in in person.

623
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Like the WWE, ECW, TNA, ring of honor,

624
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Chikara, independent wrestling, pro wrestling,

625
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Pupu.

626
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Mud wrestling.

627
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Well, we don't get egg.

628
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Any other type of wrestling?

629
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Found wrestling.

630
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
No, we don't.

631
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,440
She listens to his show, because sometimes it's funny.

632
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Now 80% of the people I listen to are show,

633
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
have stopped watching wrestling a long time ago,

634
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,440
because they thought the storylines absolutely stunk.

635
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,440
And then people that love wrestling listen to our show,

636
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
people that are wrestlers listen to our show,

637
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,440
and people that are necreative for wrestling listen to our show.

638
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
And hey, new, with Zach Arnold, Zach Arnold,

639
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,440
from poororesselpower.com.

640
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Runs down his Japan news report.

641
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,440
And all the music that you hear in a show is all original.

642
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Either I've written it, or it's performed by my group, Rep.

643
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Now, I know what you might be thinking.

644
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,440
I'm hungry.

645
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Well, you can always get a sandwich.

646
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,440
You can also listen to our show while you eat your sandwich.

647
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,440
So that's good, you know?

648
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
And that's what we try to do.

649
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
We try to bring out what's good in this world,

650
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,440
through a weekly, pro, style, wrestling, review show.

651
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,440
I hope you like me, bye-bye.

652
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,440
I like you.

653
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,440
I like that show for the pod-safe music,

654
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
some interesting tunes on there.

655
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
If you haven't done so already,

656
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
definitely check out the pod-safe music network.

657
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,440
It's where podcasters pick up pod-safe music

658
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
to play on there on that podcast,

659
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,440
and you can see what the most popular and most played shows are.

660
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Most played, well, also shows with most played songs.

661
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,440
And you welcome there as a podcaster, as an artist, or as a listener.

662
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,440
All on the pod-safe music network at music.pod-show.com.

663
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Now it's going to say something really cool,

664
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,440
but of course I forgot immediately what I was going to talk about.

665
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Oh yes, I know.

666
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
It's good to have Yonpalette back in the house.

667
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Oh, I'm counting casting with Adam Curry.

668
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,440
I suppose you think you know everybody was like,

669
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,440
yeah, what do you think you're doing?

670
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
The artist.

671
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Yonpalette with Yonpalette.

672
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Hey Adam, I'm back from New York City.

673
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm still a bit jet-lect,

674
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,440
but I do have a hit test for you.

675
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Still from the notebook.

676
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,440
I haven't had the time to gear up everything that's here in the studio,

677
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,440
so one last time I guess with the notebook.

678
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Three intros and three answers, and this is number one.

679
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
I know that one.

680
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,440
The illustrious in excess need you tonight.

681
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Hope you make it harder for me, Yonpalette.

682
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
And number two.

683
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Oh, I love that job.

684
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,440
I think I think that's the raw band with clouds across the moon.

685
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
I'm not sure, but big one hit wonder.

686
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,440
And the final one is number three.

687
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,440
I'd recognize that opening for that simply red holding back the years.

688
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,440
I think I've got three for three here in this time.

689
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
And times up.

690
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
And these are the answers.

691
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,440
This is answer number one in hit test number 59.

692
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Oh yeah.

693
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
It's in excess.

694
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
This is an idiot tonight.

695
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Cause I'm not sleeping.

696
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,440
There's something about you.

697
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,440
The mix is sweat.

698
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,440
It's a side over there.

699
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
And it's clear the involvement.

700
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I've got to let you know.

701
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,440
You want to make it.

702
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
And so number one in excess.

703
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,440
And this is answer number two.

704
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Oh, shit.

705
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Now it's wrong.

706
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Same opening.

707
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,440
It's Lisa's dance field.

708
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
Oh yeah.

709
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,440
We're around the world tonight.

710
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I can't find my baby.

711
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,440
I don't know when I don't know why.

712
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,440
But he's gonna win.

713
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I don't know where he can be.

714
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
My baby.

715
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,440
When I'm gonna find him.

716
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,440
I don't need to know.

717
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Answer number two.

718
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
Lisa's dance field.

719
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Oh, around the world.

720
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,440
And this is the third and final answer in today's hit test.

721
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,440
It's simply red holding back the years.

722
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,440
Holding back the years.

723
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,440
Thinking of the real test so long.

724
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,440
I'll keep holding on.

725
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,440
I'll keep holding on.

726
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,440
I'll keep holding on.

727
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:55,440
I'll keep holding on.

728
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,440
I'll keep holding on.

729
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,440
The third answer today's hit test.

730
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,440
It's number 59 holding back the years.

731
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,440
Simply red in today's hit test.

732
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Well, that's it.

733
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:16,440
I'm gonna try to connect everything to, I guess, cast lasted to record the next one with all the gear and the professional Mike here at help.

734
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,440
As always, feedback is welcome at hittest.gmail.com and you can find info about this hittest.

735
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
And hit this podcast.

736
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
And of course, all the info on the blog.

737
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Let's come J and P-O-L-E-T.com.

738
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Well, thank you for listening.

739
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:40,440
See you for hittest number 60 with more higher, bigger, greater production values.

740
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,440
If I do have anything to do with it.

741
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
So until then, bye-bye.

742
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Okay, thank you very much.

743
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,440
I kind of like the new format.

744
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
It seems like you're playing more of the song.

745
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
It's nice.

746
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,440
It's usually, I just, you know, I get right into the song and the hook and the chorus and then you're onto the next answer.

747
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,440
Okay, two for three today.

748
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,440
I could have sworn it was the raw band.

749
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
Clouds across the moon.

750
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Do I have that song?

751
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,440
I don't want you to hear what I'm talking about if I have it.

752
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,440
Now that I have iTunes back, I'm actually sometimes able to find my music.

753
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Let me see clouds, search on clouds.

754
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,440
Yes, okay.

755
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:25,440
Tell me if this, if the first couple of notes here aren't exactly the same as Lisa Stanfield.

756
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Check this out.

757
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Well, you have to get through this piece first, right?

758
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Shit, doesn't sound like it at all, does it?

759
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
But I do love this song.

760
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Check out the drum.

761
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Check it out when it kicks in.

762
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Yeah, no, no, no.

763
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,440
I'm trying to reach like among the people.

764
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
This is right.

765
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,440
I just want you to hear the drum's cape in.

766
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
Check it out.

767
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:00,440
I kind of reminds me of Patricia and I.

768
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:07,440
You've got to listen to it song, Rob and Clouds across the moon.

769
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,440
You know, as a final thought for today is we're talking about show notes yesterday.

770
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,440
And I tell you that show notes are very difficult to maintain.

771
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,440
Because invariably, I put in a wrong link or someone sends in a whole bunch of information

772
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,440
about a topic that I discussed that they know much more about.

773
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
And, you know, it's hard to maintain that.

774
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,440
It's really, it's a full-time job if you want to do it right.

775
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
And I've never really done it right.

776
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,440
You know, so you have kind of the way, you know, you have your prep.

777
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,440
But then you have, which is nice to have it all lined up.

778
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,440
But then really adding all that feedback in there is a complicated task.

779
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,440
I got a whole bunch of suggestions.

780
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,440
A lot of offers of people who wanted to help me do show notes.

781
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
But there's really much better way to do it.

782
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,440
And it didn't hit me until a two people emailed me this.

783
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,440
Why not use a wiki?

784
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,440
Now, if you don't know what a wiki is, check out wikipedia.org.

785
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
You'll see.

786
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,440
It's basically a collaborative writing environment.

787
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,440
And the thought here is that the show notes are put together by the listeners.

788
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Now, there's several hundred thousand people who listen to the daily source code on a regular basis.

789
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
That's a really amazing number.

790
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,440
And, you know, within that audience, clearly there's people who know just shit loads more about what I'm talking about.

791
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:32,440
And also, I'm skipping over so many different pieces of feedback that come through email on the biodiesel stuff on the sound advertising stuff.

792
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,440
And, you know, and I look at Don and Drew and they have a forum where you can provide feedback.

793
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
It's very, very active.

794
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,440
So it makes a lot of sense.

795
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,440
I think, though, that for the source code, I'd like to try this.

796
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,440
I'd like to have a wiki.

797
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,440
And so, basically, with each show, I'll just provide a URL.

798
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,440
They'll say show notes over here, right?

799
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:57,440
And then, whoever has information about what's been on the show in the rundown.

800
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Well, you know, you'll just figure it out because it's a collaborative environment.

801
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,440
I can go in there myself and actually add some of the information to the show notes.

802
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,440
So, but, you know, it'd be much more kind of a process that would evolve over time,

803
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,440
which will get indexed by great search engines.

804
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,440
And, of course, the question is, you know, how do we fit OPML into all of this?

805
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
I haven't quite figured that one out yet.

806
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,440
But then, over time, actually, the richness of the information that's provided with this podcast,

807
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,440
particularly for people who are searching for something,

808
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,440
will, you know, will become available.

809
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,440
There'll be more of it.

810
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,440
So, of course, the first thing I need is a wiki.

811
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,440
I have no wiki expert.

812
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
I don't know how to set it up.

813
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,440
I've not looked at it at all.

814
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,440
So, if you're still inclined to set something up, I'll link to it.

815
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
And let's give this a try.

816
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Let's test that out for a couple of shows and see how it works and see if people want to collaborate on the show notes.

817
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,440
And this could be lucrative for you, by the way.

818
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:01,440
For example, with the hit test, by providing the answers, you could put links into iTunes for the tracks to be purchased directly.

819
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,440
And it could be your affiliate link.

820
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,440
So, you know, I'm hoping that I'm, you know, by saying this, I'm not creating a huge spam opportunity.

821
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,440
But let's see, let's see what happens.

822
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,440
So, that's the call to use source code listeners.

823
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,440
I still have some stuff to do for a serious satellite radio,

824
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,440
which we're going to talk about tomorrow because there's some exciting news going on there.

825
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,440
And yeah, I think there's, there's an office here, isn't there?

826
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Yeah, there's, there's an office that I need to go to.

827
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,440
Oh, and a final thought for the day.

828
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,440
My God, I can't believe how long I'm talking.

829
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,440
Final thought for the day is that podcasting has such an extra benefit for me,

830
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
because we have a company now.

831
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,440
We're working, probably, we have 20 people who are employed,

832
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,440
yeah, things like 20 people who are employed by us directly.

833
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,440
And most of them have a podcast.

834
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,440
And so, even though I'm not in the office all the time,

835
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
I know a hell of a lot about what's going on,

836
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,440
because if you listen to the daily download, Chris Rockwell is talking about lots of pod show,

837
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
things that have happened at pod show.

838
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Of course, things he talks about are more cultural to the organization than business.

839
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
But it's funny, and it's great.

840
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,440
And yeah, the sue, the super extra heroes,

841
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,440
spider-man action show.

842
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,440
I can never get that one right.

843
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,440
And yes, you really get a vibe of the people that you're working with.

844
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,440
And then I know the much more intimately than I would have,

845
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
if they didn't have podcasts.

846
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
I was listening to an old podcast by Andrew Grummit,

847
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,440
which before, that was a pre,

848
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,440
we should have a BC, it should be,

849
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:40,440
because before podcast name, so it would be BP.

850
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Well, maybe BP, we call that BP, before podcast name.

851
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,440
Andrew Grummit was, because he was one of the first developers

852
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,440
that jump on and create, I Potter Lemon,

853
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,440
and built a virtual team around that product,

854
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,440
which just by the way came out with two new releases

855
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,440
for both Mac and Windows.

856
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,440
And we're working with Andrew on stuff,

857
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,440
and just hearing him talk and his thoughts,

858
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
then really gave me a whole bunch of insight

859
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
as to how we're working together now.

860
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,440
And it's a real family vibe, and it's working,

861
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,440
and it's very, very cool.

862
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,440
And it's not something that every company can do,

863
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,440
but I think a lot of companies could benefit hugely,

864
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,440
hugely if you could just tap into kind of,

865
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,440
thought processes from other people in the organization.

866
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
All right, with that said, I got to get out of here.

867
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
I'm way over my time.

868
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,440
I hope you stuck through all this,

869
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,440
and I will be back for the thank God,

870
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,440
it's Friday edition of the Source Code.

871
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,440
That'll be tomorrow, bye, bye.

872
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,440
Another pod show pod guest,

873
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,440
stick it in your ear.
