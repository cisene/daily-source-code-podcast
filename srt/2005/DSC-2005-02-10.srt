00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
source code February 10th 2005 transmeters we don't need no

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,160
stinking transmeters

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,640
it's Adam Curry it is Thursday it's the 10th of February

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,640
everybody welcome to the daily source code which is almost daily

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,040
sorry about yesterday you know what happens sometimes life just gets in the

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,800
way of shit and even though I really had planned to put the show together

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,600
I just ran out of hours in the day so I'm gonna try and make up for it today

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,360
so you probably hear a different acoustic right off the bat I'm wearing

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,040
the wireless lovelier microphone and you could probably guess just by

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,400
listening to the acoustic search to where I am of course I said that I was a

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,680
way I'm business I've been in Amsterdam for two nights now Tuesday night and last

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
night and right now it's about two o'clock I'm sorry three o'clock in the

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,960
afternoon local time and I'm flying in what is it so I'm not flying until 10 o'clock

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,280
now 930 tonight so perfect timing to do a bit of hang in here in the bunker

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:22,800
so the TV production crew is moved out they're done they were here for

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:30,080
that's Chris but I think it was like I have the lovelier on both my

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,880
headphone wires breaking against it and I think they were here for 10 weeks

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,920
and they've moved out the places completely clean whatever's left is just

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,600
after our our possessions that we left here that we didn't move to England and

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,800
of course Chris was still here and has the office and all the files

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,000
and we're kind of winding it all down you know we're still trying to get rid of

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,280
this place so trying not to empty out too much so it still looks like a house

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,880
and it's still sailable but at the same time yeah you know we're we've moved

24
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,200
we're out of the country so we're just waiting to you know finalize some

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,120
stuff here and then actually finalize our our entry into the United Kingdom

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,720
so I'm in the kitchen of the bunker you can hear actually a CNN is on there's

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,880
big news today in the UK that you'll probably hear about it's oh man they're so

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,040
happy they got something to talk about now in the big news media you know forget

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
about tsunami and Asian tsunami relief now it's Charles and Camilla they're

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
getting married it has been announced and of course a lot of people have a

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,800
lot to say about this and you know I think everyone's pretty much agreed that

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,080
it's proper that it will never be queen Camilla but it will be what is she

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,000
something of cornwall Duchess of cornwall I think is what her title will be

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,440
but wow they're pretty rough in England

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,960
Patricia was telling me that you know some of the headlines of the papers

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,320
you know he's doing it he's finally marrying the dog I think that's pretty

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,520
rough so let me just to unhook the myself from the headphones see let me turn

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,120
off this CNN racket of course now that I have the lava layer on it can be

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,360
mobile and oh wait there's no batteries in the remote

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,600
oh second so hello we're walking into crystal's office high crystal how

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,280
think our upstairs I think we've done this before one upstairs and listen to

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:13,040
our Russian concerto pianist practicing and I think I just heard a fire up the

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,240
keyboard so walk upstairs now on the second floor walking towards the back

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,240
which is where I can hear him best this is our bedroom yeah he's playing

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
oh listen

51
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,520
he's really soft or maybe something here better in the bathroom

52
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,200
I hope you can hear that it's gonna be really soft I'm sure anyway so the place

53
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:55,280
is pretty much empty I just had a couple things to do here and now I have a

54
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,520
few hours to get through some stuff you can hear me panting that's because I'm

55
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:11,240
smoking well not tobacco of course but hey this is Amsterdam right so oh the

56
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,640
minute I get in the cab with taxi Eric who's the I've had the same cab driver

57
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,480
for years he already has my first split for the day ready to go okay so let's see

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,960
today of course is it's trivia Thursday and I've been keeping all the

59
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,200
trivia stuff standing by for you and for myself of course I actually have no

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,800
idea anymore what what you know what all the different trivia bits are about I've

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,080
of course I've listened to the intro's each one of them as they came in but I

62
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,680
forgot and completely completely about you know what they are with all

63
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,200
different themes and what was this this is oh yeah Michael Butler rock and

64
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,360
old Vic sent this to me this is he plays this all the time is this this cool

65
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,400
thing these string quartet versions of rock songs and he sent me a little

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,560
package of good Charlotte songs that have been done by or because he's the

67
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:16,200
anthem let's see oh shoot kind of regular like volume there with my like

68
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,440
arrow keys I was put that in the background a little bit there so we can solve

69
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,360
some of this emptiness that you hear in the background of the house kind of

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,520
pressing so last time we spoke I was pretty hyper about the ASCAP license and I've

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,120
been received well I basically I need a producer this is my problem now because

72
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,760
you start off some stuff right and you start talking about you know just

73
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,440
about something that catches people's attention then there's all these you

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,360
know this great feedback and there's emails and there's lots of MP3 files

75
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,480
and just haven't had time to wait through it yeah if I'm at home every single day

76
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,200
and have nothing else to do but you know get up take routine at a school get

77
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,040
the papers start trepping for the show record the show you know do all the

78
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,480
post processing and you know production shit getting it up to the server

79
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,920
doing the show notes and it's that's a it takes a major portion of the day

80
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,440
I have to say so whenever something else happens it's like I just breaks down I'm

81
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,680
sitting here looking at my Gmail inbox which is I mean I love Gmail so much it

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,840
is so incredibly easy to work with it's a great combination of you know keeping

83
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
your hands on the keyboard and being able to manipulate and your mail just like

84
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,200
you could do with pine or l or you know any other of the Unix mail programs but

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,520
has all the convenience of the web built right into it and you don't really

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,720
have to use your mouse at all so it's I love that but anyway despite that I still

87
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,040
have 164 messages now waiting for me just haven't gotten to and haven't had time

88
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,800
you know so and a lot of that is pertains to podcasts so hey if I ever

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
figure out a way to make money with this shit it's going towards that

90
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,880
getting some production help and I can just see how it would work with outlines

91
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,480
and you know it could work from anywhere you don't have to live with me to

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,980
produce it but anyway so there's a whole bunch of feedback on this

93
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,440
ascap license and I'm not really sure that we have anything here yet folks to

94
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,640
be honest and I'll know much more probably over the weekend I'll have a chance

95
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,280
to sort through all of the comments but it looks like your minimum payment is

96
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,520
going to be $288 and I'm probably just going to pay that just so we can

97
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,520
fuck around and test and experiment to make sure that you know at least we're

98
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,360
pushing the edges of the envelope and then we come up with some better answers

99
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,920
and find out where the line is I don't think that you know you have to be deemed

100
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,360
a pirate or some kind of degenerate if you if you just try to do it so I'm

101
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,640
definitely signing up for it after I figure out which schedule to a select and

102
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,080
what you know how the payment stuff works I guess without having any

103
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,840
revenue on the show it's it's going to be pretty easy it's just the 288

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,280
box I think so we'll take it at that what is this I'm trying to figure out I

105
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,960
have this something that opened in my play I'm not quite sure let me see what

106
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,160
this is what is this okay I know what that is we're going to play that oh yeah

107
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,560
that's what we're going to play let's see if you haven't heard the latest

108
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,080
Jenny and Lee show I go over to Jenny and Lee dot com oh man these kids can't get

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,680
a fucking break Lee has a short podcast that you know at Christmas really allowed

110
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,280
let me just she's on the phone so she's doing work and that does have

111
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:32,320
precedence so let me just close this for a second okay now you know what let me

112
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
get everything that I have in the front so now I'm walking from the back of the

113
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,280
house through the this is the what do you call it the chapel part it's a

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,280
little little more echoey and now we're into the first front room now the

115
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,400
second front room this is the one all the way to canal side okay my stuff on

116
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,880
the phone here and phone calls now I was supposed to go flying with wing commander

117
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,520
William and looking outside you know it was like I or this morning I knew it

118
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,520
was not actually last night I knew it wasn't going to happen the weather's been

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,120
absolutely crap but not that you can't fly in this weather and not that I we

120
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,360
flown in plenty of shit weather but when you're training it just doesn't matter

121
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,680
I mean then you're you're not really going to learn that much because you're

122
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,720
compensating for forces and things that you just don't understand yet you know

123
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,040
in other words you got to learn to walk before you're run so bummer

124
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,720
it means my first you know my next training session won't be until the end of

125
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
the month when I come back from the trip on planning to the states

126
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,960
anyway Jenny and Lee and Jenny just had some some medical shit and it's

127
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,400
and it's just fucked up and you know these kids had their you know the they

128
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,120
first they moved to the states and then they had to move back within two

129
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,640
weeks because shit fell apart and then of course the dogs had to go in a

130
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,760
quarantine for six months they couldn't get them over they were sitting at

131
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,040
Atlanta the podcast community came together really helped him out with that

132
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,280
it was beautiful and now Jenny has all these medical problems and I just want

133
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,560
to know that from everybody here the courier house hold as well as Amsterdam

134
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,920
we're all thinking of you guys and if there's anything we can do you just

135
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,720
you know just let us know we want to be there for you and our prayers go out to you

136
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,320
and the last update I saw on your on the weblog was that operation was

137
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,960
success and now we have to you know start to the recovery so anything we can do

138
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,960
but just let me know right lots of feedback about a couple things

139
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,960
first of all the USA today article which I was able to pick up here online as well

140
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,240
but it's always kind of fun to see the print version a huge picture of Don and Drew

141
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,080
and of the farmhouse in the in the European or the international edition

142
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,040
which is just you know so proud so wonderful to see that I'm just like yes here

143
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,280
they are the poster children of podcasting but really you know it makes so much sense

144
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,840
when you I mean Don and Drew if you look at their picture they are kind of you know

145
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,800
two sides of the same coin does that make any sense I love them both my girlfriend and

146
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,440
my other girlfriend is apparently in New York I think there was a picture of me in the article

147
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm not quite sure how that works interesting why they would use different different pictures

148
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,360
and different markets I mean I guess they have some kind of market researcher data that would

149
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,960
lead them to make those types of decisions in fact I believe that Madge Weinstein was even

150
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,600
promised the European cover which must have changed into Don and Drew

151
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,240
because I didn't see actually even see some email correspondence about that I don't

152
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,960
maybe you were say today isn't ready for the lesbian anthics of Madge just yet so

153
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,760
that didn't happen but yeah great great article so what happens is you know lots of people

154
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,880
start you know reaching out and contacting and opportunities and it's just it's great it really

155
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,960
is a lot of cool stuff and I got major league feedback on the past two podcasts where I've been

156
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,880
playing pod safe well not really pod safe mash-ups which are commercially

157
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,440
unviable anyway because you can never get the rights to release them commercially and

158
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,240
should my pin daddy is there hook them up again in vain of playing some micro Jackson music

159
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,520
here's the Tokyo Scott Paradise Orchestra's just loose rock mix of ADC

160
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,360
pop a Jackson pop

161
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:16,520
If you see, if there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

162
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

163
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,520
If there's one for people, I don't think it's no reason

164
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

165
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

166
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

167
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

168
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

169
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,520
If there's one for people, I don't think there will be no reason

170
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
You see, oh, you gotta do it

171
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
You see, oh, you gotta do it

172
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
You see, oh, you gotta do it

214
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,760
guys done has been pretty amazing. That's the Tokyo Scott Paradise Orchestra as

215
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:29,160
just the Roots Rock mix of ABC. I was talking about Gmail just a minute ago, I forgot to

216
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,800
tell you that I'm a little worried now because I've switched to Gmail, I totally love it,

217
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,320
the interface, just everything. Forget the gig of storage, which of course is perfect.

218
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,720
So it works for me. It does work the way I think. I'm liking it. In fact, it has a lot of

219
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,240
outline or properties in their way it stacks up conversations as they call them or threads or whatever.

220
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,120
So I totally dig that, but now I've been using it for two or three weeks,

221
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm already an 8% of my quota. So what happens when I fill it up to a gig?

222
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,400
You know, then what do I do? Of course, I can send myself 15 more invitations, but you know,

223
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:11,000
what starts to make sense? Is that when I start to buy more space on the Google grid?

224
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,240
Oh, if you haven't seen that flash movie, if I have time left after the trivia today,

225
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm going to play that flash movie movie for you about called Epic 2014. My God,

226
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,920
that's so well done. Even without the visuals, I think it'll be great, it'll be perfect.

227
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,080
Happy Chinese New Year. It's the year of the Rooster.

228
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,480
That started yesterday, actually. So I was, I had it on my notes to wish you a happy New Year.

229
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,920
I don't know what the Rooster will bring us, hopefully the year, the Rooster. I had a lot of interesting

230
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:49,080
things planned for yesterday on a Chinese New Year. And so far I have to say they've been

231
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,680
pretty favorable in my way. So I'm hoping that this will be a good New Year for all of us here.

232
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,320
But what the heck has gone on with Condolizer Rice? I just wanted to say that

233
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,360
because she's been over in Europe talking to Jim DeHoop Schaffer, which of course is a Dutch politician

234
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,720
who left to join NATO. The way we pronounce this name is Yopde Hoep Schaffer. He's the director

235
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:20,440
general of NATO. It gets a lot of extra coverage on how I saw it on CNN, but I know how good the

236
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,880
coverage has been or if anyone gives a shit that Condolizer Rice is over here saying, hey, you know,

237
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Iran, but it watched their ass. And lo and behold, I'm seeing, it's like I'm seeing a fucking replay

238
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,760
before Iraq where now I see CNN shows all this, all this armament and all these nuclear

239
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,520
trucks rolling down the street, which of course is Archive File Footage. But, you know, so apparently

240
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,760
that's the Iranian threat. I mean, shit. What the hell is this? I mean, it's exactly the same thing.

241
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,280
You know, what's next? We're going to have Condolizer Rice will be holding up a vial of some

242
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,120
enriched plutonium, who the fuck knows what that is. You know, I would know it if I fell into a

243
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,400
fat of it. And, you know, this much is enough to kill everyone in the United States. I mean, just waiting

244
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,560
for that next broadcast, you know, it's just crazy. But on the other hand, I was just totally

245
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,960
tickled pink. I want to remind you that coming up, but it was at Tuesday or Monday, the 14th of

246
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,960
February, of course, is Valentine's Day. But today is 10, so it's more 11, 12th, it's on Monday,

247
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:33,800
Monday, over the 14th. And God and Themed podcast is the perfect podcast for Valentine's Day.

248
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,720
She always has a podcast of theme songs. Usually by an hour long, it's 53, 55 minutes. And it's

249
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,120
all Valentine's Day songs. And it's a perfect podcast to just kind of slip on the background.

250
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,200
In, you know, Karen does some introduction of the songs, but she has this great, like, really

251
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,440
mellow kind of voice. And, you know, and, of course, there's obviously no commercial interruptions.

252
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,040
It's just really nice. It's a great vibe. I listened to some of it last night. Like, oh, yeah,

253
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm totally going to put this on streaming through the, the eye trip. And I'll be, uh, when I make

254
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,120
my romantic moves on my significant other. If you know what I mean. Hey, everybody, it's Thursday.

255
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's Thursday.

256
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,040
Hey, y'all. Y'all believe it with a hit test. Today is his special edition. Oh,

257
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,520
because it says, Sea 100 edition with lots of air checks. Oh, so, hold on, it's like,

258
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,520
let this be the last time we do air checks, y'all. I mean, and I'm getting, you know,

259
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,160
when I listen to myself doing the Sea 100 shit, it's like, oh my God, I'm pukeing,

260
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:46,320
This is exactly why we have podcasts because, you know, this is like the epitome of pukedist

261
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
jockey 80s.

262
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,480
So please, you know, this is where I came from, not where I'm going.

263
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,680
It's probably not that difficult, it would probably be very easy for you.

264
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,920
But that should be fun though.

265
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,160
So if you're ready, here are the three clips.

266
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
All right.

267
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
This is number one.

268
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,760
Well, yes, we'll be, uh, I want to wait a couple seconds so you can guess at home,

269
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,160
but it's, uh, I read the friend plans respect.

270
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Number two.

271
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,160
I know this one too.

272
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,160
This is, um, Patrick Hernandez.

273
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Born to be alive.

274
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
And number three.

275
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
That's it.

276
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
All right.

277
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Everybody should know this one.

278
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Step and roll.

279
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
One.

280
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
These are the answers.

281
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
This is number one.

282
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
C-100.

283
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Right.

284
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:58,160
If you ever hear podcasts, go ever blow that.

285
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,160
It's something we were talking about months ago that the, that's exactly what I was doing.

286
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
That's a body and talk.

287
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I can see one.

288
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
I'm honoured.

289
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
It's reasonable.

290
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
All right.

291
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
All right.

292
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
That's good.

293
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,160
It's all in a respect when you come to me.

294
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,160
So the answer to number one is that we have a friend plan and respect.

295
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
We won.

296
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
180.

297
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I'm proud of you.

298
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Straight into the weekend.

299
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Hello.

300
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Who's this?

301
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
This is Mike.

302
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
The boy.

303
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
We like you to play bread and be alive.

304
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
This is going out.

305
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,160
David and Mike in the round.

306
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
We have a great weekend.

307
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Let's get a party.

308
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
You got a man.

309
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
It's on.

310
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
C-100.

311
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
C-100.

312
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:45,160
The answer to number two.

313
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Born to be alive.

314
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Venture can't handle this.

315
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
This is number three.

316
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
100 can't get anyone other than right here.

317
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Everybody.

318
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Everybody.

319
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Your name, but I don't know nothing fun.

320
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Okay so!

321
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Let's get the challenge back in there.

322
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Oh my goodness.

323
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,520
This my goodness a lot of energy though, and that actually and you know, it's like there's your there's your MP3 feedback

324
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,160
You know on the radio we call that a telephone, you know, we've got all the elements here

325
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,160
It's just you don't have to have no big stank in transmiters

326
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Born to be wild

327
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,160
You may be answering yourself and boy, did you do that fast?

328
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Yeah, well, this wraps up the Z100 New York

329
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
She dish it up the hit test

330
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Please keep sending air checks

331
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Oh no, hit test at gmail.com

332
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
That's quite alright

333
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,160
And see you next time, Adam for a new edition of the hit test, bye-bye

334
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
All right, y'all thank you very much, excellent

335
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Y'all collect the the originator of the hit test here in the source code, of course

336
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,160
No, not a completely new concept of boy

337
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I just love playing this game with you, but

338
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Let's uh, yeah, we got to stop with the air checks

339
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
You know, that's history

340
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm glad that there were people like Tom Scuding

341
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,160
I've pointed to him before, you know, who's archiving all that stuff

342
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,160
And that's very important, but you know, let's move on, let's move forward

343
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Let's move to the next hit test and our Thursday trivia day

344
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Hello, Adam

345
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Hello, everybody, this is Craig Maloney

346
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Just wanted to share a quick music test with everyone

347
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Hopefully this is a pretty easy one

348
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,160
These are all songs from the late 80s, possibly early 90s

349
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Countdown started

350
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Let's begin

351
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
All right, number one

352
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Number two, they pocket

353
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I don't know until this is number three

354
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I know the song

355
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,160
I don't see something I'm here to share about this

356
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Hard for me though, I know I know clue

357
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,160
And last but not least, number four

358
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,160
It's like power station, a wall of polymer

359
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,160
It's like, I'm just guessing

360
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Maybe I smoked too much dope, I can't get it

361
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
No idea

362
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Oh, that's

363
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,160
That's pretty easy

364
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Sure

365
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,160
All right, hit me with some hands with you, buddy

366
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Yeah

367
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
You sure?

368
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Yes, hold on a second, my phone

369
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
All right, let me go again

370
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm phone rings

371
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
There's the answers

372
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Electric blue by ice house

373
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
Ice house

374
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Shit

375
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
I got a pocket

376
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I was singing it, I knew that you stand still

377
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Rush

378
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Should've known that one

379
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
My god

380
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
This one may or may not have been easy

381
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
This one is

382
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Killer

383
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I seal

384
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Ah, no

385
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I wouldn't associate this with seal

386
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
But yeah, and now you say

387
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
What was I doing?

388
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
I was like running a company

389
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
I wasn't paying attention to these

390
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
There are less but not least

391
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Power stations

392
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
See, I knew it was power stations

393
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Boom

394
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Bang a gun

395
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Right

396
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
All right, so I didn't completely suck

397
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
I had some of it going

398
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Okay

399
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Good one

400
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Definitely

401
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I've created a cassette

402
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Yeah

403
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Thank you, so I got the credit

404
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I said Robert Bomber as well

405
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Boom

406
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Down

407
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Down

408
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Bang

409
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Bye, everybody, thank you very much

410
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Cool

411
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Oh man, that's exhilarating

412
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
And we've got a whole bunch of different

413
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Different ones all lined up today

414
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
If you want to send something

415
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
And we'll just do this for a while, you know

416
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I don't like you know

417
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Falling into anything that is like permanent

418
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
And eventually

419
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,160
We may even get tired of doing the hit test all together

420
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,160
But if you want to send some unique type of trivia

421
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
You've got to keep it

422
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
If it's music, you know

423
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,160
It's got to be 60, 70s, 80s, 90s

424
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
You know, whatever

425
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Just trying to stump me

426
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
It's cool

427
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
I think people kind of like guessing

428
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
And listening to me, you know

429
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Fucking it up, right

430
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Is that kind of what it is?

431
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Something like that

432
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
A broken glass

433
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
This is Frank from Hamburg and Germany

434
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,160
I've recently started listening to your podcast

435
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Quite enjoying it

436
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,160
So I thought it would be a great idea to contribute to that

437
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
For a little trivia quiz

438
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I like that very much as well

439
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
So we'll see how far you've got

440
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Okay

441
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
He's number one, get ready

442
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Yes

443
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Or question when you were in the dark

444
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,160
If you leave

445
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
I'm going down

446
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Ah, got it?

447
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Great

448
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
He's number two

449
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Oh, what's that in the song?

450
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Is that you, howling somewhat?

451
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
On we go to the last one

452
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
J

453
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
What do you call it?

454
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Ultrawax Vienna

455
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Ooh, the last one was a quickie

456
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
But I think you got it

457
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Don't you?

458
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Art

459
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Okay, here we go

460
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Here the answer

461
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
The first one was

462
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
OMD

463
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Orchestra maneuvers in the dark

464
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
If you leave

465
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Yes

466
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Okay, that's OMD

467
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
And the next one

468
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
I hope you got that right

469
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Very distinctive intro

470
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
The cure

471
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
The love cats

472
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
I never like the cure

473
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Really

474
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Nice guys, but I never really like the music

475
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
Christina's now into the cure

476
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Oh, I don't know

477
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
How do you pronounce that one?

478
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Is it Max Werner?

479
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh, Wayne and me

480
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Oh, shoot

481
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
That's right, Max Werner

482
00:31:48,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Good, Larry

483
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Okay, thank you, Max

484
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,160
And thank you Adam for trying this trivia

485
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
I hope you got three out of three

486
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
So

487
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
I got your next time

488
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Keep up the good work

489
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
And greetings from Germany

490
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
And bye-bye

491
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Okay

492
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Cheers, Grisgot

493
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Thank you very much Frank

494
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Still to come a Beatles bassline trivia quiz

495
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Which is

496
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
I listened

497
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
I listened to the first clue

498
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
In previewing it for

499
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,160
I remember I did this last week or something when it came in

500
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
And I didn't know which one it was

501
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
So it's going to be a good test

502
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
I kind of like this

503
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Let me know

504
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Most people seem to like the Thursday trivia

505
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
So we'll just keep this going

506
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
As long as we can

507
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
The lost in translation trivia

508
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Is the second time we're doing this one

509
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
This originated

510
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Let me see

511
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
There's a whole email that I put in the show notes for table

512
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Where this concept originated from

513
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Of basically taking something

514
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Putting it into translating it to another language

515
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Then translating it back through

516
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
A sort of kind of translation device

517
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
In this case I guess Google Translator

518
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Or Autivista

519
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
And then that becomes the lyric clue

520
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
For the lost in translation trivia question

521
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
To be a quad from iLoveRidue.org

522
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
And that means it's time for

523
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Cool

524
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
This sort of thing ain't my bank baby

525
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
This is how this works as usual

526
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
I'm going to take an 80 song

527
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Put it into the all of us to translate

528
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
And search engine translated to finish this time

529
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
And back again to English

530
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
You hear the translated version?

531
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
You try to figure out what the original song was

532
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Ready?

533
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Yep

534
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Let's play

535
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Here we go

536
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Do not touch me to satisfy me

537
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,160
I can no longer hold the manner by which you seduce

538
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Although you wouldn't be that so much

539
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Yet I love

540
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Now I will collect all and leave

541
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Which corrupted love

542
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's hear that again

543
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I was going to lie

544
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
I was going to lie

545
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I was going to lie

546
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
I was going to lie

547
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Of course we get to replay it

548
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Right?

549
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Do we don't have to take it in real time

550
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Like on the radio

551
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
We don't want to get one shot

552
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
To satisfy me

553
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,160
I can no longer hold the manner by which you seduce

554
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Although you wouldn't be that so much

555
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Yet I love

556
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Now I will collect all and leave

557
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Which corrupted love

558
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Which corrupted love

559
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Oh

560
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Tainted love

561
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Of course

562
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Oh

563
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Oh man

564
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
I cannot stand

565
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
But when you see

566
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,160
I love you though you heard me so

567
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Now I'm gonna let my things and go

568
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,160
So that's it for this week

569
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Here's a hint for next week

570
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Though

571
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Your clue

572
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Think

573
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Biggest hair

574
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Okay

575
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
We'll check that out next week

576
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I guess Thursday on Trivia Thursday on your daily stores coast

577
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
It's

578
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
So

579
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
You really?

580
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Hi Adam

581
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
I am Rick's

582
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
That's our

583
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
I ex from Copenhagen

584
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
I then use a kiss for you

585
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Hold the reversed hits

586
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
And the rules are very simple

587
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
You get to hear

588
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Three hit songs

589
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
But they have been reversed

590
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Of course

591
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
And then you get to hear them one more time

592
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Okay

593
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Then there would be a short

594
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Thinking intimate

595
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
So

596
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Cowbell

597
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Fiesta whatever

598
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
And then you get

599
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
All right

600
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
So I hope you are ready

601
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I'm ready ready

602
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm ready to go

603
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I know this one

604
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
I know

605
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
I know

606
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I know

607
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I won't say it until it's not

608
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
It's a long clue

609
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Okay that's a B52's

610
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Love shack

611
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Before that was 10cc

612
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I'm not in love

613
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
C

614
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Can I see this one

615
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Can I see this one

616
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
Can I see this one

617
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Can I see this one

618
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Can I see this one

619
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Can I see this one

620
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Can I see this one

621
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Can I see it

622
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Can I see this this one

623
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Can I see this one

624
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Can lanç this one

625
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Which is letting me know

626
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,160
I think that's David Bohey

627
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
One

628
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Nice

629
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Oh

630
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Stop

631
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
You

632
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Go

633
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,000
R

634
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,760
B

635
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Oh dude, I'm going to fucking answer this.

636
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I hope it's not a stand.

637
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
What do you have is it this way?

638
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Oh well.

639
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
I'm committed now.

640
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Yeah, that's a little shock.

641
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Yeah.

642
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
I think it's David Bowie.

643
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Okay.

644
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
Some of these songs sound the same.

645
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Oh, this is my cowboy intermediator.

646
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
All right.

647
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,760
We need to tighten it up a little bit and take it a little bit shorter.

648
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Okay.

649
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
So I think we have 10CC and not in love.

650
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
B-52's Love Shack.

651
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,760
And then some David Bowie, like Ziggy Star,

652
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
start us period, post Ziggy, post Patricia.

653
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Here it is.

654
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
There we go.

655
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
He is of course.

656
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I'm not in love with 10CC.

657
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Yeah.

658
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
You got that one right.

659
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Yeah.

660
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
B is Love Shack.

661
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Yeah.

662
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
B-52's.

663
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,760
And the C, I don't want to live without your liver.

664
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
What's that?

665
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
What's your color?

666
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Oh.

667
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Wow.

668
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Let's have you have fun with this music quiz.

669
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Oh, this is Rick's from Copenhagen signing off.

670
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
All right.

671
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Thank you very much.

672
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I'm Copenhagen.

673
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
All right.

674
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
How are we doing time wise?

675
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Okay.

676
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
I hope you're still with me.

677
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Now at any point, you can always fast forward through this stuff.

678
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,760
But to make it interesting, there's also a pod-safe music trivia, which is kind of like

679
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
McMotion.com.

680
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Yeah.

681
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
The listening to all these really cool trivia questions you've been getting.

682
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,760
And I thought I'd do a little twist on it.

683
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Never one knows the 80s and all that music.

684
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,760
But what I want you to do is see if you can guess this pod-safe music.

685
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Now, I don't want to give you total obscure stuff.

686
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,760
All this stuff has been played on at least more than one pod gas.

687
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,760
And it's been played over at accident at Hatch.com.

688
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
At least once.

689
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Okay.

690
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
See how you're doing what pod-safe music.

691
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Here's track 1.

692
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
I don't know, but I like it.

693
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Track 2 is a little bit easier.

694
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Uh-huh.

695
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Much easier.

696
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Track 3.

697
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,760
And here's the last one.

698
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Track 4.

699
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
All right.

700
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Well, I hope you can go tell us where we can find all these tracks.

701
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
Because I see this as a music sample.

702
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
And they're good.

703
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
I like all these songs.

704
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
All right.

705
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
Now, it's no fun without the answers.

706
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,760
I know you're like the answers right afterwards.

707
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
So now, let's give them to you.

708
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Okay.

709
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Track 1 was, now is now, with days of self.

710
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Of course.

711
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Okay.

712
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Like small bro.

713
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Sounds cool.

714
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,760
I hope you can tell us where we can find rock from manned in the marbles.

715
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,760
This is rice, like a new music sample.

716
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
It's cool.

717
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Track 3 was chance with hip hop high.

718
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Look around.

719
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
You're already there.

720
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,760
The next impact takes a long time.

721
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,760
So feel out the question now.

722
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Then drop it to a hip hop high.

723
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,760
And finally, one of my personal favorites, Taxi Doll, with waiting.

724
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,760
You know I can wait in waiting way too long.

725
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,760
So now, I'm waiting alone.

726
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,760
For this I've been waiting much too long.

727
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,760
So long, I'll never waiting as long.

728
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Anyways, Adam, I'm really digging the show.

729
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,760
And I hope you had fun playing a little pod safe music trivia.

730
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
So I'm going to buyaxonhash.com now even here more.

731
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Have a good one.

732
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Peace.

733
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Axonhash.com.

734
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Okay.

735
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,760
So as a trivia quiz, it sucks.

736
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Because I don't fucking clue.

737
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I've never heard this before in my life.

738
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,760
But if you're so confident that enough people know about these songs that you can put

739
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,760
into a trivia quiz, you know, Axonhash.com.

740
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm over there.

741
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
I like a lot of these tunes.

742
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
I'll just want to play them.

743
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
All right.

744
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,760
So the last one is we come up on the 40-minute mark is the one that I promised you about.

745
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
I think it has a lot of promise.

746
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,760
If you're a real beetle freak, and there's a lot of people who are totally into the beetles.

747
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
But baseline, now that's really tough.

748
00:41:50,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Hi, I'm this is Mike Stewart of InternetAudioGuide.com.

749
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Podcastgear.com and really my real passion is Beetles Music from BeetlesSing Along.com.

750
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,760
I've been listening to the Daily Source Code for quite some time now and I really enjoy what

751
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
you've done.

752
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,760
And I thought you might enjoy this kind of twist on trivia.

753
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Because I'm such a huge beetles fan, I know all the baselines from all the hits.

754
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,760
And I own a 67-hoffner base here in my hand, and I'm going to play baselines from the hit

755
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
songs and see if you can guess them.

756
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:45,760
Here's the first one.

757
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:55,760
And then here's number two.

758
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
I can't hear it.

759
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I know there's musicians who don't know me.

760
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,760
This one's going to be a little harder because it's not in the beginning of the song.

761
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
A little harder.

762
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Okay.

763
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Oh yeah, I know this.

764
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,760
But only because it's a solo.

765
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
And here is number four.

766
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
It's difficult.

767
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,760
No clue.

768
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
It plays well though.

769
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,760
There's number five.

770
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,760
No, no, no, no, no.

771
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I feel like I'm standing at Sam Goodie's music store.

772
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,760
But one guy's playing stairway to heaven over on the left and another guy's playing

773
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Beatles bass line.

774
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
The answer's right after this.

775
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
After what?

776
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
The commercial lesson you enjoyed this new twist on trivia.

777
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Well, the first one is all my love.

778
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
Oh my god.

779
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Okay.

780
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Oh, that's shocking.

781
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I didn't hear that.

782
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,760
The second one is I dig a pony from the let it be album.

783
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
Okay.

784
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Yeah, I wouldn't have been able to name it.

785
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
I'll still name it.

786
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
I recognize it.

787
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
She is.

788
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,760
The third bass line was the bass solo in the middle of.

789
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,760
I want you on a heavy road.

790
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Yeah, I forgot.

791
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Wouldn't have been able to name it either.

792
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Yeah.

793
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
I recognize the solo for sure.

794
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
The fourth one.

795
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite.

796
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
I'll start to pepper.

797
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
No.

798
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,760
Okay.

799
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,760
The songs are a little too obscure for me, I think.

800
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
The first one.

801
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Yeah.

802
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,760
And the last one was what Paul opens up.

803
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
His latest concert that I saw here in Atlanta.

804
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
Hello, goodbyes.

805
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I should have known that one.

806
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760
Man, great songs.

807
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
Complicated stuff, though.

808
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Listen to those bass lines.

809
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,760
That's a good shit that Paul McCartney came up with.

810
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,760
That's really.

811
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,760
The music geniuses.

812
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
What can I say?

813
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Well, I hope you enjoyed this beatless bass part.

814
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Trivia.

815
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,760
And if you like some more of these, there's 313 songs.

816
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,760
I don't want it.

817
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
Well, I hope you enjoyed it.

818
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Yeah.

819
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
I certainly didn't enjoy it.

820
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Okay, that wraps up Trivia Thursday on the daily source code.

821
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
I hope you enjoyed it.

822
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Oh, man.

823
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Let's see.

824
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I think tomorrow we'll just try and wrap up all the loose ends.

825
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
All the stuff you've been talking about.

826
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
And leave some room open for some promos.

827
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,760
There's lots of new podcasts that have lined up to be added to the directories.

828
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,760
And then on the weekend, I'm thinking we have some fun.

829
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,760
Maybe we talk to Canada for sure.

830
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,760
What an experiment.

831
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,760
If the weather was any better, then we could actually do another sound scene

832
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,760
to us somewhere.

833
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
We'll see.

834
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,760
Both the girls have, like, they have a little mini-flue.

835
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
They're all stuffed up.

836
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,760
So I think they'll be into going home soon.

837
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,760
They're kind of sucks, but may just be a stay-in-home day.

838
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
Just T.C.

839
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,760
OB.

840
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,760

My weblog www.curray.com.

844
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
We don't need any more info than that.

845
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,760
Thanks to the lovely crystal for today's show.

846
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,760
Thank you, dear.

847
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,760
