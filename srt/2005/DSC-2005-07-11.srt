1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Delta Sierra Charly 206 Bravo.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's the daily source code for July 11, 2005.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And this is Delta Sierra Charly 206 Bravo because I already recorded the show once.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And upon my usual check, turns out that I have a tech open, another audio editing program.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It was just too much for the MP3 code for an audio hijack pro.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Which means essentially it was skipping on what it was writing off to this.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I think it had, you know, if there was one or two skips in it would be okay.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I just got the casual email.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was skipping every 20 or 30 seconds.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Really sucks. So now I got to keep my eye on it.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Because it does report if it's skipped.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I just didn't see it that time. Oh well.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It goes along with the other technical glitches of the morning. My cell phone has been blacklisted.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Which is always fun because you then get to talk to the virgin team.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A virgin mobile, oh yeah.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thanks for holding on. One more moment.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We'll be connecting you to a member of our team shortly.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, shit. Anyway, when I find it, speak to my team member Garth. He was quite helpful.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And he found out that my phone had been blacklisted.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Which means it's been electronically denied receiving or making calls.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is usually something that's invoked when your cell phone is lost or stolen.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In this case, it was probably hijacked because, according to Garth, there are many third parties who will take money from you to then put someone's phone on the blacklist.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The blacklist being a central database that all the telcos use.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So you can imagine there's lots of room for error there.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And if someone has your phone number, they can just, I guess, get it on that blacklist for a minor fee somewhere.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll put a link to more information about blacklisting in the show notes for today's podcast as usual.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Got some podcasts, music tunes on the way.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We have a backtrack podcast.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's always fun, lieu of a hit test.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And a couple other things.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And of course this show is intended for material audiences only.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is the mash up that Agro 1 made spending one of these nights with Kelly.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wasn't long till we called you mine.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Since you've been wrong.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And now you'd ever hear me say,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I just have to make some new feel for you.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's all you'd ever hear of me say.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But since you've been gone.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can't breathe all the birds flying.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's so good to know you, yeah.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thanks to you, I can't.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What I want.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Since you've been gone.

Since you've been gone.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How can I put it?

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You put me on.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I even fell for the stupid love song.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Since you've been gone.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How can I never hear you say?

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I just want to be with you.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've never felt that way.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But since you've been gone.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000

Since you've been gone.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Since you've been gone.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you get whatever you want?

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:10,240
Okay it's official. Kelly Clarkson is now a member of the Eagles. God damn that was good. Patricia

90
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,920
was just in. She walked in and I cranked up the volume on the speakers for and she was like

91
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:21,760
my God. You don't even know where Don Henley starts and Kelly Clarkson ends is really fantastic.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:31,920
Art dub, adub from mashuptown.com sent me that one brought to you by Agro. Of course the

93
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,440
Eagles and Kelly Clarkson mixed together in a mashup. What you hear in the background is the

94
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,560
cooling unit Patricia purchased for me. It's been it's been well we've had a great weekend.

95
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Certainly something that everyone here could use in light of the London bombings.

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,040
Good weather always lifts your spirits a little bit and it's still amazing to me how incredibly

97
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,560
resilient the right word everyone's using the word vigilance but that's for moving forward but

98
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
the Londoners have just been you know so fuck you we're getting on with our lives you're not going

99
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
to bring us down about all this. One of my mom's friends Brenda New York she actually said wow and

100
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,920
she's been around long enough to know that the attitude is exactly the same that the Londoners

101
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,720
had during the Blitz Creek when the Germans were bombing London in the 40s only the cultural

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:29,680
makeup of London has changed significantly in the past 60 years 65 years 65 years yeah so

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
it kind of makes you wonder is it maybe something in the water you know so anyway so speaking of

104
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,840
water this thing that's in the background Patricia opted when when I was in the States for two weeks

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,600
so it was just a long time to be away from home we had a heat wave here and of course

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,880
near with the equipment in my studio slash bedroom slash office things really heat up here with

107
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,400
the sun shining directly on it so she's getting me shades those have been ordered and this

108
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:05,760
cooling unit unit isn't an air conditioner it's like a what is it a con a con there it goes nicely

109
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,680
with my senseo machine this con ver does it's and you pour water into it and the water circulates

110
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,120
in front of the fan and it gives you more cool air than you normally would with just a fan that's kind

111
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,480
of blowing the hot circulating the hotter around so it works I like it and and it's good for the

112
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:31,520
energy bill as well and let's see probably my shoulders still messed up we've deducted what or deduced

113
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,520
what what this is you know I'll tell you that story in a second because we got some other stuff

114
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,160
I got to get to this is Daniel from the My Life Bites podcast and you're listening to Adam Curry

115
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,040
on the daily source code hot Joe content that will make you walk the dog and kiss your mother

116
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:11,600
now this can only happen to a guy like me and only happen with a die like this

117
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:22,480
so may I say to each of you most gratefully and she shows each one of you a fist

118
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:38,160
this is my kind of dog match-wise Dean is my kind of dog match-wise Dean is

119
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:57,200
my kind of yeasty snatch you can't match her podcast and each time I think match-wise Dean is

120
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:13,680
making me think match-wise Dean is one die that reputantly constant life she's my kind of die

121
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,480
man how cool is that? hello my name is Simon and I'm a friend I heard this bit I did perform

122
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,360
that song you just heard I'm sorry I've just got this obsession with match-wise Dean

123
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,360
but I'd like to assure you that you weren't here anything like that on the slam idle podcast

124
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,120
which is the the podcast that I do that's a podcast that has features poetry performances

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,880
from all around the world in order for my obviously so but you definitely weren't here anything

126
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,080
like that crap sorry bye. I hadn't heard that but that came through openpodcast.org

127
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
and I was just thinking oh ma'am so jealous I wish I had people making up songs about my

128
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,760
podcast that's awesome it's from match-wise Dean yeastradio.com of course okay I was going to

129
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,920
talk about shoulder briefly because I have to go to the actually it was an email about this let me

130
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,760
see if I had this email here it is. Adam love this revolution do you have a t-shirt of the daily

131
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,720
source code would love to get one if you do no I don't we've talked about it and we might

132
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
do t-shirts if I had a fricking logo well I have I had to actually do have a logo so yeah

133
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:31,520
maybe we'll do t-shirts um I'm a physical therapist writes um David Brown and I do that in Jacksonville

134
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,680
Florida my patients are now requesting that I play the daily source code during my morning and afternoon

135
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,960
torture session so I listen to the Delta Sierra Charlie sometimes twice a day who knows maybe I'll

136
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,800
start my own podcast titled daily screams from the torture room yeah that's hot okay so that's how

137
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,720
I was going to talk about that was the bridge I was going to build to my my own physical therapy

138
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,480
which starts today at 530 at least I'm going to go over there and get myself checked out here's

139
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,440
what happened um we figured it out when I was flying in Portland we were doing like five days

140
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
four hours a day so it's a lot of intense flying and if you can experience pilot you know not a

141
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,360
low time fix we can pilot like myself then um you're a lot less tense obviously in the cockpit

142
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,640
now you use most of the work is done with your left arm most of the physical work that's we you know

143
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,800
even though it has two handles to it the the yoke or the steering wheelies you might call it you

144
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,160
usually um operate that with your left hand the right hand is always on the throttle or on the

145
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,480
controls or on the navigation there's a lot of instruments there the right hand utilizes or on the

146
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,960
left hand left hand knee of your passenger you know any of that stuff that pilots might have to use it

147
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,920
right arm for so um now the way you reduce the load on the yoke is with this you probably

148
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,440
see this if you ever seen a cockpit a big black wheel with little nubs on it so that's the trim

149
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,360
and with that you can basically do anything you know the you reduce the stick load that's the

150
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,920
foreign and back motion on the yoke uh and experience pilots of course that they're very commonly

151
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,920
kind of with the with the yoke between the thumb and the forefinger and everything's done with the

152
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,000
with the trim and of course I was much more tense and uh exerting sometimes even exerting

153
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,520
physical force without even have to because the plane was perfectly trimmed anyway and so that

154
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,680
probably you know I don't do anything with my left hand you know except pull back on the yoke once

155
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:29,520
no so the the next morning after I got my license I flew to Portland from Portland to Miami

156
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,760
and there was a stop over in Houston and I fell asleep I think on the first leg um with my head

157
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,800
on my my my palm of my hand bent backwards up on the rest and I remember on the arm rest I

158
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,680
remember waking up and going oh my arm is numb and so the result of all that is uh on my shoulder

159
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,920
blade or near my shoulder blades either tendon or muscle or god knows what it is I don't know if

160
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,040
it's inflamed or if it's been twisted but it you know it's basically um I think pinching nerves down

161
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,880
my left arm sometimes I feel tingling in my index finger and stuff so it sucks and at five

162
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,320
thirty today I will finally be looked at and see we can fix this I sure hope so maybe just bring along

163
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
some delta share a charlie huh right now though it's time to switch over to our man on the scene

164
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,080
he's following the hurricane in Florida it's Chris Perillo from Vancouver I'm watching TV now I'm

165
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,800
safe for the television I'm watching the coverage happened right now on CNN it seems to be on

166
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,240
channel let me verify this yes channel thirty three I'm close to the screen I can't tell exactly

167
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,040
what's happening there seems to be a lot of water on the screen not my television screen as I'm

168
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,480
sitting in a hotel room in Vancouver British Columbia which is far enough away from the storm

169
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,560
that we should be safe completely safe that I know of have seen no signs blowing around downtown

170
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,640
Vancouver right now uh Ponzi is in the bathroom she's in the bathroom clipping her fingernails

171
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,160
right now that I know all the fingernails are going directly into the trash can I've asked her to

172
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,800
be caught again I'm not sure she's wearing her cupcake shirt right now with her sweater hanging

173
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,080
over her shoulders I repeat her sweater is over her shoulders I'm close to the television screen

174
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
getting a little closer and this is very very dangerous especially for your eyeballs you've got to be

175
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,640
careful that your eyeballs don't touch the screen because your eyes will be damaged with flying

176
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,480
plastic might fly through the screen down from Florida I can see that the headline currently reads

177
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,360
Dennis makes landfall between Pensacola Beach and it looks like the very beach I'm not exactly

178
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,480
sure if that's the pronunciation maybe I can get a confirmation from the studio right now it's 425

179
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,080
Pacific time I'm sorry no I repeat it's actually 125 Pacific time this is in the afternoon hours

180
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,640
on Sunday afternoon I'm watching the crawl as it goes by there are horrible horrible things happening

181
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,000
signs flying all over the place Anderson Cooper's in directly in the line of this hurricane

182
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:07,040
putting his life in danger to let us know that signs are flying around they're standing in front of

183
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,440
the hotel and about to toss it back to dirty Sanchez in just a few minutes we don't know there

184
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,040
seems to be a lot of green now flying over the state of Florida a little bit of blue according to

185
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,800
the graphic is on the screen and then yellow right in the middle red yellow purple and if you're

186
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,400
in the pants of the red yellow and purple if you see this in the sky please hunker down take cover

187
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,440
you have to watch out for what's going to happen right now there's cat three we don't know

188
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,160
if they're going to be upgrading to cat six which of course is fully capable of gigabit ethernet

189
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,040
will keep reports you know streaming to you as soon as we find out again like this is a category three

190
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,920
at this point cat three with winds of 120 miles power you have to be careful slow down your

191
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,200
streams hunker down and I gotta go I gotta go you know I don't want to make light of the

192
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,240
situation in Florida but Chris Brillows point is so well made with this man where do they get these

193
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,320
everybody wants to be a fricking hero standing out in the in the street in the wind it's like god

194
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,560
ah they make it so incredibly hype you see how easy it is to do and see how you get drawn in I mean

195
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,400
it was long enough right it was like a two and a half minute bit there but it really drew you

196
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,360
when it's like oh my god what's going on purple stuff is floating over Florida hunker down for the green

197
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,720
stuff that's on your screen oh man hey I've been kind of collecting all of the comments and emails

198
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,600
and man I got a lot about iTunes and the seems we have three major areas that need to be worked on

199
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,360
and I know that the folks that I pulled listen to this podcast as well so I'm gonna see if I can

200
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,400
sum them up this is nothing that they probably don't know already but maybe there's some solutions

201
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,760
we can come up with because the amount of listeners that iTunes is driving is phenomenal unfortunately

202
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,400
we're reinventing a little bit of the wheel here and there which I think can be circumvented quite

203
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
easily and I know the community would be happy to jump in and help we just want to get it right

204
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,920
and we want to get working because we've kind of been through all of this once before you know certainly

205
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,880
in the past year or we've been kind of yeah figuring out how a directory should work figuring out

206
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,360
how a pod catcher an iPod or an aggregator should work and you know the the secret about

207
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,400
big companies is they usually have very small development teams and you know that doesn't mean

208
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,240
the teams any better or worse than a big one but you know there's only so much you can focus on

209
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,880
and there's a lot of work that goes into this stuff so the first thing is submitting your feed

210
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,120
to Apple so this can take up to three days now from what I understand because they're basically

211
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:51,280
creating a internal feed that works with the iTunes music store so this is a complicated one I

212
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,520
guess what's happening is they have to go out and scan all of these feeds you know hopefully

213
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,160
once an hour but it could be once every four hours it could be a pretty big process to do that

214
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,360
and to see if it's anything new and then translate that into their internal format now what happens

215
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,400
on the internet is shit breaks and you just don't get to certain feeds or maybe the time

216
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,320
out is a little bit too tight and it moves on and it comes back on the next scan to look at that

217
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
feed which means something you've updated could easily take four hours or longer before it's

218
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,640
taken care of and I'm sure there's all kinds of dead feed trackers in there and stuff so

219
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,840
you could get lost in the shuffle so that's kind of yeah I mean that's just something that

220
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,960
that has to be worked on you know I'm not sure there's there's an easy fix for that that's just

221
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,160
the nature of distributed computing then there is the issue of people not being able to be added

222
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,320
to the directory another thing that can take you know that can really take a couple days

223
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,200
mainly because it's a human process and that's something we learned with iPodr.org is it's

224
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,320
much easier to maintain a directory when you have people maintaining their own individual categories

225
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,440
and subcategories and are only responsible for that piece you know that really works well

226
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,400
and you know particularly for categorization and I think the way iTunes displays the results of

227
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,000
a search should could be different so instead of you know if I search for a daily source code

228
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,160
it'll pop up three times because it's listed under technology it's listed under audio blogs

229
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,040
which is actually the way it's listed an iPodr.org as well only perhaps you just bring up one icon

230
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:38,800
one subscribe link and and then say also listed in these categories and you could then you know

231
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,240
zap over those categories here's the here's the problem that's really hiding under the covers though

232
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,280
and this is something we do have with the distributed directory is when people add a feed

233
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,480
into the directory know their responsible for and let's say the feed updates and someone else adds

234
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,680
that to a different spot on the directory you now have two different addresses for the directory

235
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,640
maybe that's something that we could automate I guess let me just write that one down that's

236
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
something we could work on but that's so that's clearly going to be an issue with all directories

237
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,800
just maintaining you know or defeating link rot but that's kind of the problem we have with

238
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:23,280
the web anyway so I've got to figure that out there's also people not getting listed because they

239
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,480
don't have the appropriate explicit tag in their extensions to their RSS feed that's a mouthful

240
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,800
but I think everyone's working really hard now providing iTunes compatible feeds is funny

241
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
I think I mentioned it on the previous source code I said oh yeah you can you can just go over

242
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,040
podcast alley if you're in the directory there you have an iTunes feed and I couldn't find it but I

243
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,240
know I know it works so it's there somewhere and although we don't control any of the things I

244
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,920
don't control any of the things that Apple is doing but I have offered you know some of our services

245
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,600
to you know take the load off we already have some of the infrastructure we can you know we have

246
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,960
some of the distributed stuff that could make the directory a lot better but I do understand you know

247
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,320
this is something Apple is publishing and if you don't have the explicit tag in there or if they

248
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,640
missed it somehow you know they're not going to add you and then you you know look how many people

249
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,720
can be working on the directory to Apple you know it's only so many resources you can

250
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,480
put it on something like this so that's why I like the distributed model much better maybe there's

251
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,480
a way that you know we can just say well maybe podcast alley is a good solution for that

252
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,240
although we have to make some changes there as well I'm just ideating here for a second because

253
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,360
you don't want to be locked in anywhere so I think the solution there as you'd have to be able to

254
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,280
to register a domain name that would point to your iTunes feed something like that so you can

255
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,160
easily take it away with you if you wanted to okay I'll talk to Chris we'll make it so we'll try at least

256
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,800
this is your daily source code I'm Adam Curry I'll try to do this every single weekday

257
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:01,360
doesn't always work out that way but when we do well as always the unexpected you can experience

258
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,320
the following promo for the story of you daily is not appropriate for listeners under 18 or

259
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,920
those who are easily offended is not kidding hey this is your chance to turn it off or load some

260
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,440
Mario speedwagon or eating per cat in your player so I'm doing it right if you're three seconds

261
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,640
it's very an ensu horrible things are going to be coming out of your iPod so true or media player

262
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,920
one two three we warned you I haven't him hence him from distorted you daily if you haven't

263
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,000

264
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,240
take it and I'll cram it up your ass like a puffy vagina either just honoring their history it's

265
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:50,640
like colonial Williamsburg except with more pussy Latin men gang banging you in the back alley

266
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,400
of a tall bell the detective went on to say that the man's wife was all like yeah give it to me

267
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,840
oh right there oh beautiful good self described pervert time high as a kite you know this can't

268
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,520
and well that woman's pussy is too puffy the idea that she was going to puke shit and piss

269
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,320
since a feeling of total freedom through her she opened her mouth wide and led along disgusting

270
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,680
string of dribble go down her chin and a sick and helpless kind of fashion how dare you

271
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,520
I have offended an outrage granny's got a bloody pussy she was talking about giving yourself an

272
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:39,280
enema and a bath tub puking and pissing all while all I'm finger blasting herself and you think

273
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,280
that's hot puffy and she got all like angry I mean she's like well you don't you don't want to

274
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,800
help your community and I said no I hate my community so sorry to burst your penis bubble there

275
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm probably going to die as the thing she felt the brown water turned into violent

276
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,800
squirting diarrhea before subsiding to occasional spasms in her hole

277
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,720
hardship glad you listen to this bromo puffy pussy's an exploding diarrhea that's that

278
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,240
started new difference it's 10 minutes of your life you'll never get back come for the news of the

279
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:23,360
weird stay for the audio pornography what it's the distorted view show most of our

280
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,800
high spots were coming to us now by TV series central but not this one series 148 Adam Curry's

281
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:35,040
hot show experience the unexpected tell the world tell this to everybody forever they are

282
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:54,160
through the central 148 I'm a little confused about all this anime fire about drug laws

283
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,280
and holy walls and people freaking out over what they want to freak about

284
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:12,640
oh so tired there's nothing on my radio some little girl who laughs and swing me

290
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,600
hope we won't find our next year

291
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,600
set it by their religion they at all
