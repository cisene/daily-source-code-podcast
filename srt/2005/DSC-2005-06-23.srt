00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
Well, good morning everybody from Seattle, Washington in the north-western part of the

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,640
United States.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,080
Welcome to the Daily Source Code.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,240
Today is June 23rd, 2005.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,960
It is 1120 in the morning here in Seattle, which I have this great watch I told you about

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,280
the Patricia Bach for me, which means it's 220 in New York and 720 in the United Kingdom,

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,080
820 in the rest of Europe.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,440
Now that you know that I'm your world clock, welcome.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,120
I am really excited.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,320
Excuse me, I just opened the windows here.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,920
Got in last night, Flu Direct, we're not direct on force, and the Flu from London to

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,640
to Seattle via Chicago, which made for a very interesting flight.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,840
Was nice about it, it was United Airlines, and United Airlines on Channel 9 has, if it's

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,440
gone, and usually you can listen to the cockpit and listen basically to the communications

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,960
between air traffic control and all aircraft, including the one you're on, and also aircraft

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,240
to aircraft communications, and that was actually funny because I was pretty tired and we

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,600
left like one PM, and I liked you know, down one glass of champagne, which of course they

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
always hand you in a little plastic cups, and then I fall asleep just about as the engines

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,360
are revving up on the runway, and I had my headphones on, actually my ear buds, my

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,640
Sony in earphones, listening to Channel 9, so I knew it was going on, I could hear about

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,960
all the bad weather in New York, and I actually woke up two hours later because something

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,160
some instinct in me said, oh wow, hold on, I'm not hearing anything else, and I'm hearing

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,680
the radio, and of course we were over the, over the ocean at that point, so it was logical

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,600
that there was a lot of air communication going on.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,880
But here for Numbdix, which today it's seven o'clock as registration, a little pre-party,

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,880
and then Friday and Saturday is the big, well it turns out it's going to be quite a big

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,680
conference, I don't think it's actually, I don't think it's a, I don't know how many attendees

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
there are, I don't think it's really big, it's been sold out, they actually had to get

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,240
another room to be able to handle some of the overflow and be able to let more people

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,400
into the conference, but I feel that we're at a tipping point, and really the million

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,160
listener March has begun, and we're going to see a lot of announcements coming out,

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,560
some of them already happening today, which just made me so incredibly happy because we're

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,280
at this tipping point that I've been working towards my entire life, or most of my, certainly

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,440
all of my adult life, where the listeners are coming, and this is something that we've

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,640
talked about before on the source code, and Ron and I have talked about it in our strategy

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,720
cast, it's all about getting the listeners in, that is step one. Oh, but actually there's

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,040
something much more important than I'm excited about, congratulations to our operations officer

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,720
Brian Longus, a pod show, his lovely wife Jennifer, their twin boys, because they have another

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,080
addition to the family, Mason Andrew Longus was born yesterday, eight and a half pounds,

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,800
woohoo, for Jennifer, Lociento is what Brian will be saying, fantastic, couldn't be happier for

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,440
you guys, that's great news, so our pod show family has been expanded by one in just overnight,

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,200
so that is really one of the most exciting things. In order to understand why I'm so excited about

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,920
what is happening right now, I think I should go back a little bit and just tell you a bit

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,480
about myself, which I don't think I've really done the whole story in chronological order on the source

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:01,120
code, but I've been a broadcaster all my life, it's funny, it's a day-winder, throughout a

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,400
comment on his web blog a couple weeks ago, you know, Adam's just a DJ. Well, in many ways,

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,720
I am just a just a DJ, but my experience in radio and broadcasting goes back much, much further,

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,080
and I want to talk a little bit about that so you can understand why I'm so excited about

49
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,160
what is happening right now, and what the reasons are for the excitement, because there's a

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,240
whole bunch of things just happening in succession, boom, boom, boom, one after the other is,

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,920
just stuff is just spitting out right now. When I was, well, first of all, I've always been into

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:44,240
into sound, and when I was six years old, I can recall two things from my, from my past,

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm just loading something up here, I want to share with you in a minute, and there's actually

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,920
a picture somewhere of me sitting in my parents' closet, and I'd found an old real-to-real

55
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,480
recorder, and I don't think it actually worked, but I was sitting there with a microphone,

56
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,400
just in the closet with the doors open sitting in between clothes that are hanging up and playing

57
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,600
with this real-to-real recorder. And I also remember there was a kid on my blog, he was 13,

58
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,640
I think I was seven, and this was when you're still living in the States, and he had a miniature,

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,640
it was a red plastic real-to-real recorder. These, these reels were no more than dollar

60
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,160
pancake size, really, and actually you could turn it on, you could record your voice,

61
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
you could then rewind it and listen back to it. And that was the first time I heard my own voice

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,080
on tape, and I'm sure that anyone who's heard their own voice played back from recording

63
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,760
for the first time is always like kind of freaked out, because like, wow, I sound like that,

64
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,360
I sound like a girl, which of course at the time I'm sure I did sound like, because I was just a

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,840
little, little take. I actually remember saving up four weeks' worth of allowance to buy this tape

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,200
recorder off of this kid, and it was a messed up little machine, because the batteries that would pop

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
out, and if they popped out, it was almost impossible to get it to work properly again, so I had to go

68
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,080
back to him five or six times, until he got fed up with me, and then he wouldn't help me any more,

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,680
with fixing it. But after that we moved to the Netherlands pretty quickly, so the tape recorder

70
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
got lost somewhere in the mix. By the way, I'm pacing around the room, this is what I like to do

71
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,160
when I'm just yapping away, and this is going to be pretty much just a talk source code.

72
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,840
So we moved to the Netherlands, the Netherlands up until the 1990s, so the Netherlands,

73
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
you know, Amsterdam, we lived right underneath Amsterdam about 10 miles south.

74
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,760
Up until the 1990s, the Netherlands had government or state run radio and television,

75
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:52,400
which is not easy to conceive if you've grown up in the states with commercial broadcasting,

76
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,560
but most of the world actually still to this day works in this manner, where the government controls

77
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:06,240
the air waves, and they determine who is going to utilize those. And in most cases, in the

78
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
Netherlands, it's a very small country, you know, size of Rhode Island, probably a little bit smaller,

79
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,080
completely packed, 17 million people, all speaking one language, by the way,

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,880
certainly at the time when there was like 12 or 11 or 12 million people many years ago,

81
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,640
it's all Dutch. And the way the Netherlands chose to do it is they said, okay, we're kind of like

82
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,360
a social democratic country here, what we're going to do is we're going to let, we're going to

83
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:42,080
parcel up the air time on these frequencies based upon popularity of religious groups,

84
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,080
which is just an amazing concept when you think about it. And to this day, they still have all these

85
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,880
different broadcast organizations who are allowed to, who are allocated time on these television

86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,640
and radio frequencies. And at the time, there are only two television stations and four radio

87
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,000
stations that you could listen to, but they were national, so there were transmitters all over the

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
place. And to this day, you still have at least five or six different religious groups

89
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,000
who have time allocated to them based upon membership. And membership, interestingly enough,

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
was measured by subscribers to your TV guide. So here's the wacky thing, I don't want to go into

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,400
that too much, but you know, the TV guide is the TV guide, everyone knows what's going to come on

92
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,680
because everyone publishes their information. But all the articles and the additional information

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,040
and really the concept of becoming a member, a member of a group that would allow your group

94
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,160
by having more membership to actually get more air time was very compelling at the time. And

95
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,080
it worked well for many, many years. But you can understand that at a certain point as the

96
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,000
world started to open up and more communications became possible and people started to cross borders,

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,640
that there was a real need, a real demand for other types of programming than what we're available

98
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,240
at the time. Now, please understand, as a kid, one is only one radio channel, one frequency

99
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,160
you can tune into that had the, quote, popular music and it started at 7am and ended at midnight

100
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,240
and it was basically controlled by all these different religious groups that that wasn't necessarily

101
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
compelling for everybody. And quite honestly, that just wasn't enough. There wasn't enough choice

102
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,800
or enough diversity for it to really work for anyone. So although that model I think was probably

103
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,280
valid at the time, what we have to look at is the frequency distribution. That's really what

104
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,880
it's changing here underneath our feet and from this distribution change comes many, many, many

105
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,840
derivatives which is going to make life extremely exciting. So I, without really knowing it was probably

106
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:59,040
one of these frustrated teenagers and I was very interested in broadcasting. Don't ask me why

107
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,120
don't ask me where, you know, if that's a gene that you're born with or if it's a reditary or

108
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,320
if it's something, I don't know, I just, I always like broadcasting and I certainly was no looker.

109
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,200
So I always felt that radio was perfect for me, you know, the old, the old adage of the perfect

110
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,360
face for radio. Well, that's totally how I felt. In the 70s, there were a number of

111
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:31,360
older people, I'm talking 20, 20, 30 year olds who were also very frustrated with the media

112
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,600
landscape, not just in the Netherlands, but all over Europe. And believe me, this is still to this

113
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,600
day is happening. The airwaves are regulated by the owners of the airwaves. That is the country

114
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,200
that the airwaves are broadcast in i.e. the government and of course having that type of

115
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,600
power to decide who uses the media landscape is power. It's big power. It's political power.

116
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,240
It's very, very important to the government to know what is being said and who's saying what.

117
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,800
But there were a number of, you know, so the music scene was just, that's really where it came from.

118
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,640
It was exploding. We had, you know, we're just coming off of kind of flower power hippie,

119
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,920
you know, the Beatles, and I didn't really, you know, I got into the Beatles very late because I'm

120
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,640
just not old enough. The purple, Led Zeppelin, you know, heavy, heavy ass rock, and then of course

121
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,440
disco came along. But music was changing very rapidly and lot was going on. And it wasn't getting

122
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:40,640
the exposure. Now we didn't have, you know, iPods and iTunes and digital radios and satellite radios.

123
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,200
You know, we had, you had a radio. You probably had a transistor radio and you had a record player.

124
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,480
And, you know, you have parties and you bring over your suitcase full of records and you take turns

125
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,560
playing, playing the music. So it was a frustrating time or unsatisfying. Let's put it that way.

126
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:06,720
So a number of people who felt that they also had some kind of calling or mission to be broadcasters

127
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:16,240
with the help of interestingly enough and backing, financial backing of radio manufacturers started

128
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,120
these pirate radioships in the North Sea. The North Sea sits right off the coast of the

129
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,280
Netherlands between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. And they had found kind of a loophole in the

130
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:35,040
law, which was if you're on, if you're on international coastal waters, then there's no law

131
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,920
that applies to you. And so they were there broadcasting on mediumwave AM, basically broadcasting to

132
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,280
well, like radio Caroline, we were broadcasting to the United Kingdom who had similar issues with their

133
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,640
BBC public, you know, their government-controlled airwaves. And there was radio Veronica and me and

134
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,080
me go and radio North Sea and these guys were all sitting on shitty ass boats and some great

135
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,880
radio to listen to, by the way, you know, when big storms on the North Sea and the anchor

136
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,640
broke loose and they were made a call and then these guys the competition got so fierce between them.

137
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,520
They started throwing bombs at these other ships and it was pandemonium. And of course,

138
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,040
eventually they figured out a way to outlaw that. And the North Sea is not that big so it's kind of

139
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,800
hard to outrun and you know, and believe me again, the awesome power of airwaves is a very important

140
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:37,360
issue to any type of government. So they came on shore and radio Veronica basically did something

141
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
really smart as they said, you know what, we think that we have enough power, we have enough people

142
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,000
who are interested in our type of programming which is religion, agnostic, you know, it's all about

143
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,040
entertainment, fun, music, being there, being a part of it, being a part of this cool club,

144
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,000
we think we have enough to qualify to get a broadcast license and they mobilized on the 18th of

145
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,200
April 1970, Paul, I forget the actual 70 year, they mobilized, I think more than a million people,

146
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,200
I believe, to march on the government in the Hague and the Netherlands to demand that radio Veronica

147
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,160
receive a slice of this airtime. Now there's a whole bunch of, you know, there's a whole

148
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,400
lineage that keeps on going from there, but that was really the start for me, where hey wait

149
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,280
and then here's something new on radio, they only had a couple hours a week on the public broadcast

150
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,840
frequencies but it was exciting and it was fun and these guys were yelling and screaming and playing

151
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,880
great songs and just having a good time and I totally felt I want to be a part of that and the

152
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,680
mystique of the man behind the microphone for some reason just really struck me. Now of course I was

153
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,520
14 years old, there was no way in hell, I was going to get on the radio, but I had received from

154
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,560
my parents a radio shack 101 project kit and I'd probably still sell something very similar to this,

155
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,200
which you know, then it was just transistors and diodes and capacitors and now it probably

156
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,440
includes integrated chips that you can manipulate and build applications with, but it really was an

157
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,880
application kit and you had little wires, different lengths, red, white and blue for a different length

158
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,840
of wire and you could clip these into little springs and create things and one of the things

159
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,600
that could be created was an AM transmitter and the transmitter was very, very weak, it didn't go

160
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,080
far at all but I had learned enough through this project kit to understand that I could probably

161
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,640
also build an FM transmitter which I did and I built a little FM transmitter which really doesn't take

162
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,440
a lot of components to create that and it can run off a nine-volt battery and then of course

163
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,280
it all comes down to how good is your antenna to really get your signal out and the distributed.

164
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,400
So I'll be tinkering away and also at the time I was heavy into CB radio so I knew a little bit

165
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,120
about again there's that radio thing, I knew a little bit about antennas and how they worked and

166
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,240
and just had learned a lot just by fooling around with it and using it and I built an FM transmitter

167
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,800
and immediately told my mom, come on mom jump in the car we got a drive around and see how far

168
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,680
the signal reaches and man it was good you know I could see where there were some dead spots in

169
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,080
in my broadcast but it was cool and what I would do is I'd just try to cassette player plug that

170
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,360
straight into the transmitter and you know so it would roll on for a bit and would listen to it

171
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,960
and so my mom was nice enough to drag me to drive me around and see that a couple of times she

172
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,880
got tired of that eventually of course but um a day or two later I heard through the neighborhood

173
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,040
and then we lived in a small village maybe only 800 people lived in this village just south of

174
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Amsterdam that other kids had heard this because the frequency the dial wasn't jammed you know

175
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,400
there was there was only a couple of stations so there's lots of free spectrum interestingly enough

176
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,120
just unused at the time and they were listening and they said hey that's pretty cool man we

177
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:06,240
we heard the signal that you've been putting out and so immediately I was I was I was I was hooked

178
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,840
and I was the next thing I did oh that's right then I figured well wouldn't be nice if I could

179
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,840
you know do just like the big guys and I could play a record and talk and then play another record

180
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,240
and I had a microphone so that was no problem but essentially I had to figure out how to mix

181
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,760
all this together so bought a couple more books you know got the soldering iron out bought some

182
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,120
a few components some potential meters basically faders slider faders and built them into a

183
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,160
wooden cabinet I was no woodworker by any means but it kind of worked and I had a mixer and I

184
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,040
could mix stuff and I started doing broadcast and you know and it was totally harmless so I didn't

185
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,880
have to really worry about any local FCC getting on my butt about it but I was I was I was I was

186
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,680
like wow look at this feedback people are listening to what I'm saying they're hearing the

187
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,240
music I'm playing they're responding to it and that gave me a great feeling and I really wanted

188
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,480
to do something with this when I was 15 I saw an ad in the local newspaper that they were looking

189
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:17,120
for on air talent and engineering talent for the the nearby located hospital the tulip

190
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,960
possible hospital in umstulfane again south of Amsterdam I jumped on you had to be 16 but I

191
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
cleared it when my parents had said yeah I just lied to them you know you can just say or 16 if

192
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,480
they ask if you get caught well then you're out of luck but we think it's it's a close circuit

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,440
radio station which means you have a very captive audience it was it was quite a trip but they

194
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,920
had a professional studio and they had you know a big mixer and they had you know they had

195
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,320
everything except the transmitter actually transmitter was just wires running through the entire

196
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
hospital so people would listen in on an earphone they had a choice of you know the four

197
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,200
national uh nationally run uh stations and then a fifth station which was this radio tulip

198
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,480
power tulip radio and it would come on at six p.m. and it would go off the air around nine or

199
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,080
ten and we had different groups working that and it was all um volunteer work and I was accepted

200
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,120
I wasn't accepted as an on air host I was accepted as an engineer first off and so I was

201
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,960
running the board as we say it for um and stringy at microphones for the different shows and I do it

202
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,920
as much as possible in between homework and and school work and I'd go to the station I really

203
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,920
learned my chops there and that's where I was introduced to many different techniques of presenting

204
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,960
there were a number of people there who were very very influential on me and as I was building my own

205
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,760
craft but it was a great place to get my chops down and I met a guy there called Yurumfen

206
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,600
who I'd later I went on to create many many great radio shows with who was working at a pirate

207
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,920
radio station in Amsterdam now so here and this time I'm 1617 and you know mobile had a had a

208
00:19:51,920 --> 00:20:02,880
a moped which kind of looked more like a motorcycle and oh boy who's this oh boy oh no one second

209
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I just got to take this I'll be right back and go anywhere okay sorry about that uh interrupted my flow

210
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:17,600
okay um right so I met this guy and um and he was working for a pirate radio station

211
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,960
in Amsterdam and this was a much bigger operation these guys had 150 watt FM sender

212
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,360
sender transmitter they had a huge antenna on top one of these canal houses and they were broadcasting

213
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,040
from Friday afternoon until Sunday morning and it was the rhythm of the city it was decibel radio

214
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,440
it was fucking amazing and we had a tremendous reach because of the height of our antenna and

215
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,600
we were playing and this is you know eighty eighty one I think yeah eighty eighty one and we were playing

216
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,480
Madonna when the one her her record first came out that included borderline in holiday and it wasn't

217
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,280
until two years later that that became a hit we were playing and this is in the days of fun boy

218
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,720
three in banana ramma it was Johnny Gill and Stacy Lada saw it was really music you just could not

219
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,800
get anywhere else and we were major heroes we were all fucking geeks and we were you know basically

220
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,640
shun you know from from social life but we would all converge on this little station which you know

221
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,360
we had we had advertisers local advertisers we had enough money to pay rent and we had enough

222
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,080
money to kind of keep the operation going we still had the all pony up for the drinks and for the coffee

223
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,880
but it was one of the most fun periods of my life we were just creating complete free form radio

224
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,200
doing whatever we wanted the only restriction we had basically was our own lives and there was

225
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
no way that we were making enough money to pay ourselves to do any of this but man we were having

226
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,640
a great time and the feedback loop through the to the phone line and through just people on the

227
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,560
street it was great and from that day I you know I knew this is well I already knew it but

228
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:03,360
I wanted to be a broadcaster parallel track I was a oh man what do I have I have like ten I

229
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,960
went to I'm at the pause this and continue a little bit later but it'll be worth it because

230
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,560
I really want to get some of the story out so parallel track I was working at a computer electronic

231
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,960
store on on weekends on Saturday selling components and stuff and the first computer started

232
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,280
to come out and I'd already been introduced to the Apple 2 my dad had one which I didn't

233
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,040
really use but I kind of tinker to run with it the common or VIC 20 came out and I learned a

234
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:40,640
lot about you know just how data flows through a through a computer and there was another guy there

235
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,600
who was a friend of mine he was a little more technical than I was but together we came up with

236
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,200
our own modems that we built so essentially it was a 75-bod modem which and it was acoustic

237
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,480
and he said I had a little kind of like acoustic coupler made out of cardboard boxes and you

238
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,440
we dial each other up and then we put the phones on to our cardboard box acoustic couplers

239
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,360
and if I hit the A key on my terminal like a second later or so it would show up on his terminal

240
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,280
and so we had a way to communicate and I think it was from that day because I keep coming back

241
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,920
to the modem story that I knew that there was going to be a way to broadcast remember I've been

242
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,680
doing everything illegally or at least not on real frequencies up until that point I knew that there

243
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,480
would be an alternative way to distribute that would allow for radio to happen in different ways

244
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,560
what we'll just call it radio it's really audio distribution of audio but we'll just call it

245
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:49,600
radio to make it much easier and it was throughout the next 15 almost 20 years that this just

246
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,000
kept staying in the back of my mind I knew that there was going to be ways to do this when the internet

247
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,080
happened when it started to to pop onto the scene and I was introduced to the internet in 1980

248
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:10,160
788 when it was you know there was no worldwide web yet to get a slip account in order to dial in

249
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,880
it was all unix it was something completely different than what we see it today although

250
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,040
structurally not really that different just it was presented in a different way we hadn't developed the

251
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:27,280
web browser etc. I kept playing with ways to distribute audio was the most logical one because

252
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,960
I've been a Mac guy all my life and I've been playing around with quick time for a long long time

253
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,720
and understood editing and digital editing I got it completely you know it's a copy paste right

254
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,960
that's that's really what editing is you don't need much more so since I since I was 14 I've

255
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,400
basically been honing my chops on on this audio stuff and I remember when higher speed modems

256
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,440
came out and my first company had just started up it was called on-ramp and the technology portion

257
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,480
was based in an apartment in San Francisco where the guy who I'd met from son micro systems

258
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,360
called Jacob and his brother Chris and so they had a couple of sun servers with a T1 line which

259
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,560
was a big deal to get it into their apartment there and on in barca deero and we were you know

260
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,080
serving up at that point not even yeah I think we just started serving up mosaic web pages that's

261
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:32,000
right mosaic was out and I remember when the first 9600 bought modem came out and Carl would sit in

262
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,520
San Francisco and through the I think was the PCM codec was basically streaming in real time audio

263
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,840
to me now it would come through you know choppy and it would have to re-buffer and it would break

264
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,920
but you know he had him on the phone he said okay check this out and he would start up a little

265
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,440
units process they would be blasting out this you know in a one song or whatever I think I think

266
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,000
was this I got I wish I remember what song it was and it would come through on the other end

267
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,160
I was like god this is fantastic we just went across the country and it was transmitted through

268
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,320
you know through these wires and I was freaking out I loved it I knew that it was going to happen

269
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,440
now of course I didn't have any of the technical knowledge or understanding of what that you know

270
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,040
what that really meant you know what the bandwidth considerations are what the scalability was

271
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:25,680
of it all but it wasn't long after that that you know I had actual an actual office in New York

272
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,480
had one employee Brad Sirling who we were sitting in an office together I got a call one day

273
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,720
yeah I'm gonna finish this part of the story then I'm gonna have a quick lunch and I'll come back

274
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,360
and I'll finish it I got a call one day from a guy he said hey look my name's Ron Bloom

275
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm in Los Angeles I think I have an idea and this is 1994 so I think I have an idea of how we can

276
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,080
do something with the Grammys because I know the guys over at Narris the National Court Academy

277
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,360
of Recording Arts and Sciences and I think that we could put together what he called a cybercast

278
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
which was at the time you had simulcast remember those from the 80s we could watch the

279
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,040
concert on TV and the radio station would broadcast it in a beautiful stereo sound

280
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,840
said we could do something really cool where the Grammys are on TV and we'll provide a

281
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,920
separate broadcast which will consist of web pages it will consist of pictures Casio just come out with

282
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,080
their first digital consumer camera that they were trying to get into the marketplace and I said

283
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,960
I think we can also interview and do some audio I'd also hooked up with progressive

284
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:45,760
networks which was Rob Glazer's company before it became real networks and so he came into New York

285
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,160
the next day you know we talked about the idea I said it's great I'll see you tomorrow in LA so we flew

286
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,400
out to LA we went to the Grammys and we said hey you know we want the license to be able to do this

287
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:05,040
cybercast and and really at the time the Grammys was you know there weren't troubles a very broken

288
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,640
brand it was all you know considered old fashioned and certainly not hip and so they liked the idea

289
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,960
and they said well that's fantastic we'll give you a license for a million dollars and we said hey

290
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,720
that's really cool but we were thinking zero dollars because we have no money and we talked them into it

291
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,880
and we were thinking that the way we would monetize it is that we could go to their existing

292
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,000
sponsors and sell on a little sponsor ship and as we're walking out the door with our free license

293
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,880
they said oh one more thing you can't approach our existing advertiser so we had a couple of months

294
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,440
of real you know real starvation there trying to figure out how we were going to make this happen

295
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:54,320
and we teamed up with a great sales company who media america who helped us sell this to advertisers

296
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:02,480
of course was a lot of it was experimental budget at the time but we got it done and we had to drop

297
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,760
a T1 into the shrine auditorium these days I'm sure the shrine auditorium has plenty of fiber all on

298
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,680
its own you know we flew like a team of seven or eight out there all people who are you know

299
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,160
still very dear to my heart and we've worked together for a long long time we had a great time three

300
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,720
days of the Grammys and we were actually streaming audio and we were doing CUCMe if you recall that

301
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,400
CUCMe video it was it was it was it was just fucking phenomenal we were creating content on the

302
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,560
fly that was written it was pictures it was captions with the pictures it was streaming audio it was

303
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,000
CUCMe it was all little bits and pieces but together it really made a beautiful broadcast environment

304
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,440
it was a very exciting time for us and we went back after the Grammys and we just you know okay

305
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,800
now everyone's gonna call every record producer all the artists all the labels the television

306
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,600
stations anybody who has anything to do with content is going to is gonna start calling and we sat

307
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,360
by the phone four days and heard nothing but fucking crickets not a single person called

308
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,120
now we did actually start a company from that because we did at one call from a gentleman

309
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,240
called Bob McColley who worked at the Anheiser Bush and he said he'd called up and he said hey

310
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,960
I saw you guys at the Grammys we're really interested in some of this stuff and we'd like to know more

311
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,200
and do you have you know do you provide these services and of course we put on our other

312
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,880
hat and said well yes of course Mr. McColley we provide these services for you and we we essentially

313
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,080
went out and to St. Louis and created Budweiser dot com that was the first of many initiatives

314
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,000
but we were creating content we had the Bud guy on the road who went to all the races

315
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,760
we had the born on date if you look at your Budweiser bottle or can you see that it says this

316
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,040
beer was born on that was something that we that we came up with by um there's always been a

317
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:00,320
barcode which can tell you down to the quarter hour when that actual beer rolled off the the assembly

318
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,560
line and you could input that code into a little web app we had made and would tell you when

319
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,560
your beer was born and that turned into an actual branded thing on the on the Budweiser cans and

320
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,720
bottles so but that's beside the point there was it was just it was not going to happen we were

321
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,080
not going to be able to create our own content and distributed and at that time I'd after MTV dot

322
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,880
com we had metaverse dot com the vibe which was you know just all kinds of great stuff that we

323
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,040
were putting together ourselves we had no way to monetize it except selling it through to corporate

324
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,560
corporate entities who wanted to use that to make themselves more attractive to their core audience

325
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,680
now that was what eleven years ago ten years ago and now and of course the the big problem was

326
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,920
we really didn't have the audience there was no audience to speak of and now as we fast forward

327
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,000
I think it was Peter Day actually let me I think I have this bit Peter Day the BBC

328
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,400
he really said it right I'm going to you've heard this in a million times I'm going to play it for you

329
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,760
again because I don't always think get that listen to what he says it is so true this is this is

330
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,720
you know this guy's been in broadcasting for thirty five years listen to what he says

331
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,400
something remarkable is happening here radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who

332
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,720
managed what you can hear since radio is invented it's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with

333
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,680
something or nothing to say so exactly the gatekeepers and they're called gatekeepers but I don't

334
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:39,200
think you know anyone who controls the frequencies that were allowed to broadcast on allowed to use

335
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,400
for distribution they're not necessarily all evil but it's a big power game there's a lot of

336
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:50,480
things that's stake in that so now with what we have we have the bandwidth to be able to do audio

337
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,080
we certainly have the bandwidth for audio but only barely I'm telling you we're going to run into

338
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,480
some interesting situations with bandwidth and we still have to figure out how to handle that better

339
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,040
because there is a very definite cost attached to distributing this audio over the internet

340
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:15,040
we have the iPods MP3 players we have this mobile mobile radio that we can take along and it's

341
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:21,360
almost like history is repeating itself you see companies who have the radios they're investing in the

342
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:30,560
pirates so you're seeing Apple trying to get podcasting into the mainstream audible is actually a

343
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,440
pirate by themselves I would say initially they're you know but they have done a lot of work on

344
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,400
on creating a lot of these well creating the first the first real player I think auto

345
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,000
will can be credited with and bookmarking and all kinds of stuff like that but they really

346
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:55,520
pioneered that space Microsoft real networks the distribution is about to blow open wide and what's

347
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,600
interesting is that they're still and I think certainly also hear it at nomdex a lot of it's

348
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,040
still about the technology audio just launched a public beta yesterday and I of course I'd

349
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,560
signed up for an invite and I got in and although their creation tool isn't working yet

350
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:20,320
they're providing a way for you to it's a sample to browse to sample and to subscribe to podcast

351
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,720
and what was the most enjoyable thing you think oh well you know he's this is a competitor

352
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,880
and I'm not gonna like what I see and how do we go and you know how do you fight these guys

353
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,360
not true at all oh no way I've always said we have to bring in the listeners it has to be made

354
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,840
easier we have to bring in the hundred million listeners in order for this to really start

355
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,360
to to be something exciting and we're at that tipping point because what do I see on Odeo's home

356
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,320
page I see the daily source code I see three other shows that were involved with all being

357
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,360
distributed through Odeo so it's fantastic I couldn't be more happy about this stuff

358
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,400
Apple is what they announced are doing something with the Sundance Festival

359
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,600
Robert Redford and you know of course Apple has all these big Hollywood contacts that's great

360
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:21,440
I want hundreds of millions of people to hear about podcasting and to go sample it wherever you can

361
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,960
because my mission and our mission has always been to get this great content in to nurture this

362
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,800
content help people who don't who have something to say who are communicators but don't know how to

363
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,880
handle the technology don't know what to do with it maybe are just a bit intimidated by creating it

364
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,240
that is that is where the magic is finally we can create our own content and get wide distribution

365
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,280
and the good stuff does always rise to the top and when I say good stuff it's good stuff to you

366
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,000
if you're looking for something and you're interested in a particular topic very much like

367
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,800
web logs you'll find it it's going to flow through through a number of different ways of course

368
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,920
there'll be some traditional marketing and advertising that that always helps I've been working

369
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,960
very hard on pushing podcasting out to the public thank God we got a name for thank you

370
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,640
Danny Grigwar we got a name that you know helped the the traditional press glam onto it

371
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,680
and you're going to see in the next few weeks an incredible amount of traditional already existing

372
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,600
content or people who are already stars and celebrities they will be podcasting they're

373
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,240
it trust me I think the clear channel who own many thousands of radio stations

374
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,080
that they're going to do a deal with it could be Apple I don't know that would make sense

375
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,560
and they'll be podcasting all their stuff and that's great I want lots of people to come in

376
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,840
where we're going to shine is when we start bringing stuff that you've never heard before

377
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,800
and that's of course what people have really glomed on to particularly in the United States is

378
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:13,200
this fresh content fresh ideas exciting ideas unregulated ideas boy that's a real big one there

379
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,000
but also there's no time constraint except for the fact that I have a lunch hold on a second

380
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:31,120
let me see what this is hello hello be right down okay shoot you know what you're just going to

381
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:38,720
have to wait for another three seconds before I finish this up wow so what was only three seconds

382
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,720
for you this is double time-shifting technology it worked my friends was three and a half hours for me

383
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:52,880
I'm now back in my room the phone call you heard me get was uh Don Katz uh from audible and uh he's

384
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,160
in Seattle and so we had a quick a well quick yeah like an hour long meeting over a quick lunch

385
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,800
and after that I went to real networks who are located headquartered actually in Seattle

386
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,920
Rob Glazer who well we talked about that earlier who have known for many many years and there's

387
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,560
another company let's add a fourth to our list who are going to help us with our 100 million subscriber

388
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,760
March 100 million listener March and we have a ways to go but I can't tell you how excited I am

389
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,400
about all these companies that are basically going to open up the path to listeners and it's going to

390
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,360
be very interesting let me give you some numbers here for a second um and we're already at about 37

391
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,320
30 eight minutes I think yeah 38 almost 39 minutes I want to wrap it up pretty quick um according

392
00:38:50,320 --> 00:39:02,240
to a article I read today Apple iTunes so this iTunes music store reached 1.7 million households

393
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,360
in March okay seems like a big number it's a spit in the bucket when it comes to what broadcast

394
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,320
radio and television networks reach it's really nothing I think we've discussed the Wall Street

395
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,640
journals reporting earlier that all online music sales all online music sales that includes

396
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,360
rhapsody that includes iTunes music store it's it's anything you can find that sells music online

397
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,320
is only about 2% of the entire sales of the whole music business so we've got quite a ways to go

398
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,960
and what we're going to see is that as listenership opens up and it's going to be up to you I mean

399
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,120
this is the beauty of it is if you want to just create a show I think every every podcast has a minimum

400
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,280
of 10 listeners because that's going to be your friends your family you know your your boy scout

401
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
group whatever it is you know and which of course will be very feasible to do very economical

402
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,480
because you just it's you know those prices are coming down fast enough and there's some great

403
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,320
services out there of which pod show also would be providing services but if you want to

404
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:21,120
really go out aggressively and get listeners and it's one thing to do it in a if you're like a

405
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,520
a common entertainment base show and you just want to have a broad appeal which I think is very hard

406
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,760
to do by the way it's very hard to appeal to a big mass audience or if you're doing a beer cast

407
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,480
and you just want to talk about beer your your listenership is going to grow let me just give you

408
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,080
some other numbers the daily source code which has currently approximately a hundred thousand

409
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:48,000
downloads per show a hundred thousand downloads per show of which the numbers actually increased a little

410
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,400
bit now it's about 25 to 27 percent of the daily downloads are through subscription which means

411
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,760
it's automatic that costs me or pod show in this case about three hundred fifty dollars a day

412
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,080
okay so it's not free and and there's many many ways that that can be dealt with and many many

413
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,080
economic models that can be put into place lots of them and that's exactly what we're working on

414
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,880
with all of these companies which is why I'm happy to talk to all these companies and

415
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,880
people have different motives different reasons for going out and doing podcasts and actually going for a bigger

416
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,720
audience some is for promotion of something some will be because of the nature of it you can say

417
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,480
what you want be free and some will maybe you know have ulterior motives and deals actually let me I

418
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,040
want to you know give you a quick little taste of a podcast that is a co-production that we're doing

419
00:41:51,120 --> 00:42:00,080
that will be launching in the next week or so it's Spike Lee just listen to a little bit of the Spike Lee

420
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,240
podcast and I think he'll he'll totally get it how what how he's using this medium here he comes

421
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:14,000
we want to make the best fucking film post wait a minute what did that stop oh is that my

422
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,640
Mac again acting up of course this is interesting I mean people ask me what's the worst thing

423
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,480
as a director and a lot of times I make a knowledge between sports and films because also two

424
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,720
of my interest but the worst thing in sports is when you have an athlete only cares about his

425
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,520
statistics the team is about me me me how many points I'm gonna shoot I'm gonna shoot

432
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,600
and there's a lot of excitement building it's a very geeky a lot of it's about RSS

433
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,600
Microsoft will be announcing their plans with RSS now I know exactly what it is I was asked not to

434
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,240
talk about it it seems that it's pretty much common knowledge and a lot of people were told with their plans were

435
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:49,600
audible will be making an interesting announcement also involving podcasts subscriptions and RSS

436
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,000
look for big big big Hollywood companies to come in I don't know if I can't remember if we talk about this

437
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,800
but I'm sure that clear channel yeah I do we talk we did talk about this who own all these

438
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,560
radio stations they're going to be taking their content and podcasting it that's great you know that's

439
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,040
fantastic but if you look at those numbers and you see that we have an audience that is growing but we

440
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:23,760
need to move towards the hundred million listeners where is the next great content going to come from

441
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,960
it's going to come from you it's going to come from all of us who have ideas who want to get those

442
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,360
ideas out who want to share with people and you know it may you may be intimidated by the technology

443
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,760
you may not have all the pieces together for the format and if you want to monetize it commercialize it

444
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,760
that's what I want you to come to us for come to pod show for that send an email to atamercareer.com

446
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,920
listener march is on its way I think it has already been underway but after nomdex there's going to be a

447
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,760
lot of heat and a lot of big companies mentioned them all in this podcast who will all be moving

448
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:21,600
towards bringing their existing listeners in exciting new listeners to come in and when they come in

449
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,480
it's not going to be just about content you could have heard on the radio it's going to be about

450
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:36,560
this fresh new exciting group of voices that have great ideas and just haven't had the opportunity

451
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:43,680
to get it out there or may not even have known that the opportunity existed so that said we're going

452
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:51,520
