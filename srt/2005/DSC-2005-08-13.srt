1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Don't see her, Charlie Chippel too.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, I gotta start.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Daily Source Code.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm here with my dad and my mom, and they're both now recovered from the flu.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, pod, father.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tell us how you're doing.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Represent, he's supposed to.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He's supposed to.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
On the East Coast, we ride to the day we die.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, what?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's just from the side.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't understand.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Amsterdam or Rotterdam.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Rotterdam.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are we in, can you move over a little bit?

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're in Berkeley, California.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's on the other side of the bay from San Francisco.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And we are recovering.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
At the wonderful Claremont, resort, and spa.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But before that, I want to explain that to you.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is not like Oprah, where you get to grab the wine.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Excuse me, Oprah.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oprah, Oprah.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What I want to say is, don't forget the trip in the plane.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, no.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That was just a positioning where we are.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When we were still had our flu.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, let's go back.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go back in time.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The last time we spoke with our listeners.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Listeners.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Listeners.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It was Monday.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And we got, what are like, 121 comments?

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And a comic strip.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And a comic strip from the comic strip holders.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And the comic strip holders.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And the comic strip holders.

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And the comic strip holders.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And the comic strip holders.

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you want to say about how you live.

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Did you see that comic story?

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What do you love?

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What do you want to say about how you live.

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What do you learned about how you live?

52
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Did you see that?

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ah, the comic strip.

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The comic strip blogger did a comic strip of three of us.

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I want dressed with wrinkles.

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's wrinkles.

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please.

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You don't care what he says?

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think it, yeah.

61
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Does he know me?

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I always was pretty accurate at time.

63
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He would wear some butt-hand.

64
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are sort of a beavers.

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you.

67
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sure something.

68
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we were sick in the hotel all the way through Wednesday.

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah.

71
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You were really, really.

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Please, just how sick was I?

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have to say, Adam is never sick.

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Right.

75
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And normally when I am sick, you immediately have the chicken chicken.

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right.

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I make an old fashioned ginger chicken chicken.

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Which is brew?

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Because you are always good.

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And Dr. Still don't know why it is so good.

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It really, really helps.

84
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can we confirm your...

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't explain it.

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Can we confirm your a witch?

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah.

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's got the brew brew.

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I couldn't do that.

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And there is nothing worse than being in a hotel and being sick.

91
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Right.

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You feel weak.

93
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, thank God we were there.

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You know?

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

96
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It was just me and myself and I.

97
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

98
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Could have been.

99
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I would have been.

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I would have been.

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I would have been.

102
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I would have been.

103
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I would have been.

104
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I would have been.

105
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I would have been.

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So we were in New York City, which was the hottest time of the year.

107
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I was 90 to 95.

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The moment you came out of the hotel, it was like stepping in hell.

109
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

110
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay.

111
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It was so hot.

112
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I forgot all about that.

113
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

114
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I didn't even think about that.

115
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This time.

116
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I mean, either really.

117
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No.

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I wasn't thinking.

119
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But when we lived in New York, I remember that the one summer.

120
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We stayed in New York.

121
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And we said, we'll never stay in New York.

122
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I said, okay, that's it.

123
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

124
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's move.

125
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So.

126
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's just not.

127
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Just a little dry cough left.

128
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes.

129
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Just now.

130
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But it's nothing compared from what you had.

131
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

132
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And.

133
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So.

134
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How was it?

135
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

136
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How sick was it?

137
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

138
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I was just explaining.

139
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want you to really, really, really sick.

140
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Talk about the symptoms.

141
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been seeing that for a long time,

142
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
shivering, sweating like crazy.

143
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I had to sleep.

144
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There wasn't.

145
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Another bad or anything.

146
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I had to sleep in the bed.

147
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
With me.

148
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
With you.

149
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I had to sleep on a little part of the bed.

150
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Because the rest was soaking.

151
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Soking wet.

152
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now think about it.

153
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My mom said had a very good.

154
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Um.

155
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Um.

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Um.

157
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Um.

158
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Explanation.

159
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

160
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And she's thinking about.

161
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

162
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Theory.

163
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She said.

164
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now.

165
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Can you imagine the next person that has to lay in that.

166
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, disgusting.

167
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because you know, it's seeped all the way into the box.

168
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh.

169
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The box.

170
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You know that happened before.

171
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So don't even.

172
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We like.

173
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We can.

174
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

175
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, not not like.

176
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No.

177
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I still.

178
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

179
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I spilled on the floor.

180
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I ruined the couch.

181
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What do you always do with home?

182
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

183
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Really.

184
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Made yourself at home.

185
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's clear.

186
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So yeah.

187
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
These were the.

188
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The sweating nights from.

189
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right.

190
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

191
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So we said.

192
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go.

193
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What?

194
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What?

195
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

196
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We were.

197
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We originally planned to go to Vegas.

198
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

199
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then.

200
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's not do that.

201
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's not go to Vegas.

202
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah.

203
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We literally work.

204
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because you know, traveling makes you really, really tired.

205
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

206
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Especially when you're not feeling well.

207
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So we had.

208
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But we said we wanted to go to San Francisco, which was our.

209
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Our idea anyway.

210
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

211
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And our plan.

212
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And so we did.

213
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And.

214
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Boy.

215
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That was nasty in that plane.

216
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, before we even got to the plane.

217
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Uh.

218
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We.

219
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
First we had.

220
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I did a smart thing.

221
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

222
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Because I knew that the traveling to Newark Airport from the east side was going to be a pain.

223
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So first I got a huge humongous penis extender limo.

224
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

225
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we at least would drive in comfort.

226
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Because we shifted.

227
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

228
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

229
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It was nice.

230
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And now.

231
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So this was Christina's first time in a.

232
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
In a pimp daddy limo.

233
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh.

234
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah.

235
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And what did you think?

236
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's a lot less fun.

237
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

238
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

239
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A lot less fun.

240
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It looks.

241
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

242
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I got nothing so actually.

243
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No.

244
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's not.

245
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And it's actually uncomfortable.

246
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

247
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In the back seat.

248
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

249
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The side seat is shit.

250
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And the movements that the limo makes is not very nice.

251
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's experienced.

252
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Couldn't even record on the corner.

253
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The back up.

254
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The back up.

255
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's useless.

256
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So then we got to the airport.

257
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And you had your first experience with.

258
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
T.S.A.

259
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The transportation security.

260
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
My God.

261
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's what happened there.

262
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I see.

263
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm old enough to know how it was to travel.

264
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And you know.

265
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And travel by plane.

266
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It was wonderful.

267
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It was wonderful.

268
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So we had little white gloves.

269
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh yeah.

270
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It was wonderful.

271
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It was just.

272
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Such a wonderful experience.

273
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know, you.

274
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The people of the.

275
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was called the.

276
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The.

277
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Security.

278
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The airline.

279
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The airline for example.

280
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They would spoil you.

281
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You know, they were.

282
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They respect you as a client.

283
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

284
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And is everything okay.

285
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Can we do something for you?

286
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Can I say anything?

287
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You need.

288
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you comfortable?

289
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, of course.

290
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Need a pillow.

291
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Of course.

292
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you need a blanket?

293
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're comparing first class service.

294
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No.

295
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, even.

296
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right.

297
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But, but you don't get that.

298
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Economy was nice.

299
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You didn't even get that with first class.

300
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, you get a reused pillow.

301
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But so first we had.

302
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

303
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm.

304
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Actually talking about 30 years ago.

305
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah.

306
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
30 years.

307
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

308
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But the problem starts when you have to take your bags.

309
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
First you check.

310
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Check your bags.

311
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then you have to take them.

312
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Back again.

313
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

314
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And they go wait and line.

315
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You have to lift them off again.

316
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If the list.

317
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So if you.

318
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A tiny little woman with a very heavy suitcase.

319
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
With humongous knockers.

320
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You know, what do you do?

321
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What do you do?

322
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You need help or something.

323
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So you have to carry them off again.

324
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

325
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Put them on your on your trolley again.

326
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

327
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Then.

328
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then drive to.

329
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Right.

330
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The trolley to another side.

331
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's when you have to lift them off again.

332
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

333
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Give them to a couple of very slow motion.

334
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do it.

335
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do.

336
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No.

337
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We're in the line.

338
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And they said, oh, you've been slept for.

339
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're the VIP.

340
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And we were like.

341
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah.

342
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You've been selected.

343
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You've been selected.

344
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You've been selected.

345
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I was laughing.

346
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, that sounds nice.

347
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes.

348
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

349
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So we directed to the line.

350
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They come with us.

351
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

352
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

353
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I was smiling.

354
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We had one way electronic ticket.

355
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So immediately you get selected to the.

356
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Social.

357
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Special treatment.

358
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And I know I remembered.

359
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

360
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And so we.

361
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If I if I have to touch any sensitive area, I'll let you know.

362
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I'll let you know.

363
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I'll do it with the back of my hand.

364
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

365
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

366
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What could you just like grab my sensitive area?

367
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know.

368
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why that tone?

369
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

370
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why that tone?

371
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Nobody did anything wrong.

372
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It is a hassle anyway.

373
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why do they speak to you like that?

374
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They scream.

375
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And they're.

376
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

377
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The grass.

378
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There is the whole day.

379
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sure you wouldn't be.

380
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

381
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It would be much.

382
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It would be fun if they had a little rap.

383
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You know.

384
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's like, you know, they enjoyed so much that they have the power to.

385
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That it does feel a bit like it.

386
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
To command people the whole day.

387
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

388
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It does feel like that.

389
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A little bit.

390
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's horrible.

391
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And only Americans do that because not in England.

392
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And then we got on the plane and immediately they gave us real knives.

393
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

394
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

395
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

396
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

397
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We were.

398
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I was like.

399
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

400
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We sort of medium class when we were.

401
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I'm had a guy next to him.

402
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh.

403
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He was doing office finger.

404
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh.

405
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was looking at him.

406
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I thought first.

407
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I thought.

408
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My God.

409
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is he biting his nails?

410
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's nothing left.

411
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He has nothing left.

412
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He moved onto this finger.

413
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then I saw that he was actually biting on the rest of his fingers.

414
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh.

415
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah.

416
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I said, you know, like you have nothing.

417
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You have nothing else to do.

418
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So you're.

419
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're.

420
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're looking at what is this guy doing?

421
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah.

422
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You know, before you.

423
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You kept.

424
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Bring it to my attention.

425
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No, then, you know, as to I noticed that the guy was eating his fingers constantly.

426
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

427
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They were red.

428
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They were almost.

429
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He.

430
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Eat it to the bone.

431
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh.

432
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So this was a very nervous.

433
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sure.

434
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I was.

435
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

436
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Did you call that a tick or a direct kind of a thing?

437
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is it?

438
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Fucked up.

439
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah.

440
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah.

441
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was horrible.

442
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And constantly constantly.

443
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
From the storm to the other fingers.

444
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I said that to them.

445
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And I said, and I'll look at him.

446
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And from that moment on, his appetite was gone.

447
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He said, he turned his shoulder to the guy.

448
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And it was his health trip was ruined.

449
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
His fingers looked like pencils that you had sharpened with the pen.

450
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like he was.

451
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No.

452
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Like his finger was in a pencil sharpened.

453
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

454
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah.

455
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That was disgusting.

456
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But anyway.

457
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So that was it.

458
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And so we were not having.

459
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And we didn't have any appetite.

460
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No.

461
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Not at all.

462
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And then we got in late.

463
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And because it was very busy.

464
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But I was very proud of you, huh?

465
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because, you know, you actually have physical discomfort from pressurized cabins.

466
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll get to you in a moment.

467
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Get to you in a moment.

468
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Pressurized cabins and lack of oxygen.

469
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because of my heart condition.

470
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's just, you know, not a joke.

471
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I was very proud of you.

472
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

473
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And people who have heart conditions are very sensitive to pressure.

474
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

475
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, and it was, and it was a full plane.

476
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And you could sometimes, the captain just let the pressure drop it a little bit.

477
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You know, and then it goes up again.

478
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And then you think, my god, can breathe at the moment.

479
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And then you feel, oh, feel better now.

480
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know, it's, it's sort of up and down.

481
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And we had the nice first class.

482
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
First class seats right by the toilet.

483
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Which eliminates the entire first class part.

484
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

485
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That was life.

486
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I am not a Gucci perfume.

487
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It starts right.

488
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It almost like.

489
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No.

490
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Now before actually we, before he, someone took a big crowd.

491
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I heard, no, no.

492
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I heard a mom screaming next to the door was actually really next to us.

493
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

494
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Right behind me.

495
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So every time you're, oh, yeah.

496
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You know, flush it.

497
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But we weren't even in the air.

498
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And normally you don't go to the bathroom where you're not in the air.

499
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Because you know, why should this another poop story?

500
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No, it's not.

501
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But I heard a mom say, hello, hello.

502
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You done that out because, you know, we got to go.

503
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We had to go.

504
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We have to go out.

505
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

506
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And, and, and she opened the door and I saw this boy sitting with his pants on his

507
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
clothes.

508
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And mom, I'm not done that.

509
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's how.

510
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And she closed the door again.

511
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And then while she closed the door, we got a knife.

512
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And then while she closed the door, we got a knife.

513
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
My lawn.

514
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Move.

515
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, the sort of a menu.

516
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And instantly the, um, the person came around.

517
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Which was a home of, you know, of course.

518
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And he came out gay guys always fun.

519
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And he looked at me as my god.

520
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And that was actually designed to take out my Gucci and

521
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
a few months, spray a little bit.

522
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And after that, he was okay.

523
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Right.

524
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And you were friends with the poster for the rest of the food?

525
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah.

526
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We really did each other.

527
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We bonded.

528
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.

529
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We bonded right away.

530
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There at that moment.

531
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

532
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And so then we got in the, there's nothing else on the flight.

533
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, except the Christina was freaking out.

534
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because of like three thunder and lightning.

535
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Thunder and lightning.

536
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay.

537
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's fear of flying disease.

538
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.

539
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not.

540
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It is no.

541
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But your dad's a pilot.

542
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I did that in the word.

543
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You were asleep with your mouth open.

544
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I can't judge by that.

545
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No, but if you're in an airplane.

546
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And you see all this bolts of lightning.

547
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't you immediately think of one of those films.

548
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You think, oh, shit.

549
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We're getting struck by lightning.

550
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're going to go down.

551
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And then you get turbulence.

552
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No.

553
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And you feel everyone shaking.

554
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And the plane gets hit so far away.

555
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And then, of course, I kept waking mom up.

556
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you?

557
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Wait.

558
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What are you waking mom?

559
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's a muckney.

560
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I feel really bad.

561
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know.

562
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I just like that.

563
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I get a heart attack.

564
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
She's not allowed to.

565
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So, you know, she knows that because she was a baby.

566
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And she was about four months old.

567
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
She already, you know, we took her to Holland.

568
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
She's used to it.

569
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't understand it.

570
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why she flips.

571
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know.

572
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wow.

573
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

574
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Anyway.

575
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's from the movie.

576
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I have from the movie.

577
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So then we got in.

578
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And of course, the car wasn't waiting for us.

579
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
No, right.

580
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So you had saw your father.

581
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, my god.

582
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Not, not again.

583
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

584
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So there was no car.

585
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And but we had a suitcase as real.

586
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

587
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
While we were waiting.

588
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We had to watch over some questionable suitcases with his guy with a beard.

589
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And we really said.

590
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What was it?

591
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You said.

592
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, a breath.

593
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I mean, I'm going to get blown up.

594
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm going to smell like airplane.

595
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That was okay.

596
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

597
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because it was not a suit, guys.

598
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He was actually a package.

599
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And we had.

600
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, and stuff was like taped up in a cardboard.

601
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah.

602
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah.

603
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Really wrong.

604
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
How come eating it?

605
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This guy's like, I bet he got special treat.

606
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Can you keep an eye on it?

607
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And the guy goes away.

608
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And we're looking at.

609
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We're like those things.

610
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's what everybody thinks that these days.

611
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah.

612
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh my gosh.

613
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And Adam comes and I say, you know, we have to keep an eye on that.

614
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm bad.

615
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Give me a minute.

616
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Have me taken a minute.

617
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm impressed.

618
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So anyway, so we got a cab and the cab brought us to the hotel.

619
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And it was like 130 in a morning.

620
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

621
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

622
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
132 plot.

623
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now 130.

624
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And it's a huge.

625
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Hmm.

626
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How can you explain this place?

627
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's on a hill obviously.

628
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's one of those.

629
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's on a hill.

630
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Think straw hats.

631
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Do you have a picture?

632
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

633
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah.

634
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

635
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We're people.

636
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah.

637
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The girl's staying out.

638
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And the movie dirty dancing.

639
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's sort of the family resort.

640
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Everyone has like the hats.

641
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

642
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There you go.

643
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's both.

644
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Thank you.

645
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

646
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can go.

647
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

648
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I mean, in the old movies, when they had the straw hats.

649
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Mm-hmm.

650
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And they've a very old fashion.

651
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They've a hassle.

652
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, who was it?

653
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh, no.

654
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sorry.

655
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not that old.

656
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah.

657
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not talking about straw hats.

658
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No.

659
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm safe.

660
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It took some ages.

661
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Good.

662
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Nothing to do with straw hats.

663
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

664
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Exactly.

665
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's Mr. Membo.

666
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
How's that?

667
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's okay.

668
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Good.

669
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And.

670
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Which is nice sweet.

671
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Which looked out at the air conditioner.

672
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, first.

673
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah.

674
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And I say, well, that's very nice.

675
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, it's not going to do.

676
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You were not in the mood for it.

677
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No.

678
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I am not going to accept this.

679
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm on another room.

680
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I thought, good.

681
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

682
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Screw that.

683
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't want to.

684
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey, I had.

685
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I went to this whole thing on the phone about the baby.

686
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Right.

687
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You wanted to baby you after all the sickness and.

688
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

689
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And we were still hockey.

690
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

691
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah.

692
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

693
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So.

694
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And there we go.

695
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The men.

696
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You got the manager.

697
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Well, of course.

698
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The hotel.

699
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So get the manager.

700
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Because a lady downstairs.

701
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Because it was in the middle of the night.

702
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No.

703
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
She didn't know.

704
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
She was not in the mood to.

705
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah.

706
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Whatever.

707
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah.

708
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Change the room.

709
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But you did it.

710
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

711
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So this place is.

712
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's nice.

713
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And we sat out in the sun yesterday.

714
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And today.

715
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It wasn't a sunny day.

716
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No.

717
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Today was another sunny day.

718
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We drove into Berkeley.

719
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

720
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And you know how you know their songs.

721
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And Scott McKenzie.

722
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you're going to San Francisco.

723
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well.

724
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You know.

725
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's still the same.

726
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

727
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
All those hippies selling the same.

728
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Tied.

729
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Beats and flowers in the hair.

730
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh.

731
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It was cute.

732
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It was like.

733
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Time stood still.

734
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

735
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I got a full ring.

736
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It brings me out of the forks.

737
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I bought a ring.

738
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

739
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It sounds really bad.

740
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But they bend it and make it look like a ring.

741
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

742
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's pretty.

743
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have an order of ring on.

744
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's from nice.

745
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Nice.

746
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And no spoons actually.

747
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Nice.

748
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And he makes beautiful jewelry out of that.

749
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's what it was.

750
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Very good.

751
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So anyway.

752
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This is a very special edition of the Daily Source.

753
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
She haven't even mentioned.

754
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because one year ago today, I did the first Daily Source Code podcast from the castle.

755
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We were still living there.

756
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And what did I say?

757
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I was actually in the comments.

758
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I haven't listened to the show, but you then said somewhere.

759
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Something like, well, what did you say?

760
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What are you going to stop talking to yourself?

761
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, no, no, no.

762
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I said, are you ever gone to earn some money with these?

763
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't want to do this.

764
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You know, is this work?

765
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Is this something you're going to earn money with?

766
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because, you know, you put a lot of effort in it.

767
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And time.

768
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And I said.

769
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And what did I say?

770
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Why is it going?

771
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I always said, okay.

772
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I like the bar for a long time.

773
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I got one, two, two.

774
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.

775
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hey.

776
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

777
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
We had a lot of testing to go through in the beginning.

778
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I've sat on the early days.

779
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah.

780
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's right.

781
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I mean, Christina, you were there throughout the whole.

782
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't remember the process.

783
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, I was too busy being on the good shot at Message Board.

784
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Thank you.

785
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And you were in the paper, right?

786
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yep.

787
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So the word is out that Pod Show company that Ron and I started received funding from a group

788
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
of really top-notch investors out here in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, which is

789
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Clienter Perkins.

790
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You haven't met any of these people, unfortunately.

791
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I hope that maybe you want to.

792
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah, if you want to.

793
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

794
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Definitely.

795
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
We can set it up.

796
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let me cool.

797
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Clienter Perkins, Sequoia Capital.

798
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And then Ram Sri Ram.

799
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Um.

800
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And that's really exciting.

801
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah.

802
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I mean, the daily source code listeners had heard about this.

803
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Of course, I couldn't talk about it on the show.

804
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But it's been a big part of what we've been doing.

805
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's very good job.

806
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Unbelievable.

807
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So.

808
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And Monday, we actually are in our office.

809
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah.

810
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah.

811
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The temporary office.

812
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah.

813
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

814
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

815
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And then we're going to start figuring out how we're going to spend this money

816
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
to grow Podcasts.

817
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah.

818
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Right.

819
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We kind of have an idea, obviously.

820
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

821
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's great.

822
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

823
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That everything you ideas ready in your head.

824
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I know that.

825
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And then to celebrate Christina did something very nice.

826
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
She.

827
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I did something nice.

828
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

829
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I know.

830
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

831
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What did you do?

832
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You went downstairs.

833
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I got you in a point for a floatation.

834
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

835
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes.

836
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And I did.

837
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And I did.

838
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I did.

839
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
15 minutes of floating.

840
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What?

841
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That was so far away.

842
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah.

843
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No.

844
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Fifty minutes of floating.

845
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So I went downstairs.

846
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah.

847
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And I want to tell you about my floating experience.

848
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah.

849
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Because you didn't want to tell us.

850
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Now we want to know.

851
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So first of all, you are where you're swimming trucks.

852
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're going to have to make it really.

853
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They want to know.

854
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They want to know.

855
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's floating in the back.

856
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah.

857
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I want to make sure they had a float box that would be good enough.

858
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Sure.

859
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's only one person.

860
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's one person deal.

861
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It looks basically like a big kitty litter box with a door.

862
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Literally.

863
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Like the ones that our cats dump here.

864
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Really?

865
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yep.

866
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And now, of course, why do you float?

867
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Salt water probably.

868
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

869
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We're not talking salt water.

870
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We're talking like.

871
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Like 800 pounds of salt.

872
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh my god.

873
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So you have to show it.

874
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So you have to show it.

875
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Something like some chemical salt.

876
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't know.

877
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I didn't.

878
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Didn't sound right.

879
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Whatever it was.

880
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And you get in and then you lay down and you float immediately.

881
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You just floating.

882
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yeah.

883
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And it's only like maybe that deep like a foot deep maybe.

884
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And then they go really good about that.

885
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, this is this is the question.

886
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah.

887
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What is so good about it?

888
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

889
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm not quite sure yet.

890
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because you're basically you're sitting there floating.

891
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah.

892
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
In the dark.

893
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Are you supposed to fall asleep?

894
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah.

895
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But you're in like salt water.

896
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And then you get on your face and starts to crackle and dry.

897
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

898
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And then accidentally.

899
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's not good for you.

900
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I touched my nose.

901
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And then of course, you know me.

902
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I would taste it.

903
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And it was like burn.

904
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's like putting my tongue in battery ass.

905
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh my god.

906
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's your face really go deep in the water.

907
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
They give you one of those airline pillows.

908
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But then your hair is in the water.

909
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And it's like, man, I didn't do that.

910
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Do you would fucking.

911
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You would say, I'm you.

912
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You would look at that thing and say, I'm not getting in there.

913
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And as I'm walking there.

914
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I need music.

915
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

916
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Point.

917
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Point.

918
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Point.

919
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Point.

920
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Now they want to see you.

921
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah.

922
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
No.

923
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah.

924
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Except.

925
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

926
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But only the.

927
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The blink blooms.

928
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The blink blooms.

929
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There was no melody.

930
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The starting blink blooms.

931
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah.

932
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Ash.

933
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh.

934
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh.

935
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And as I was walking there, even.

936
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The woman was saying, have you ever done this before?

937
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So no.

938
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, some people don't like it.

939
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Oh, that's nice.

940
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Are you telling you for that?

941
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

942
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If you have to pay $70 for it.

943
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah.

944
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Really?

945
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'll come back in ten minutes and check and see if you still like it.

946
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, I don't know.

947
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Money bag.

948
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It was.

949
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But you know, I said, would you like to go?

950
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because I was late, of course.

951
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The full 15 minutes or just the remaining 30 that you have.

952
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm good with the remaining 30.

953
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
By the way, a guy in the.

954
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In the.

955
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
In the locker room.

956
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
In the locker room.

957
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In the locker room.

958
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I says your Adam Curry.

959
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I said.

960
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah.

961
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yes.

962
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He says.

963
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You're home like a horse.

964
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
He said.

965
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
He said.

966
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm.

967
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I forget.

968
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He's.

969
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He's.

970
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
He's.

971
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
He is.

972
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That's bad.

973
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I forgot.

974
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's not hard.

975
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Boy on.

976
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Well, I forgot his name.

977
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He said.

978
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I.

979
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Congratulations on your financing.

980
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh, that's nice.

981
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

982
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't want to bother you because you hear a few relaxation.

983
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, that's right.

984
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So anyways, then I got out of the fucking salt.

985
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You like it.

986
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

987
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It was a great sensation.

988
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It was it was like waitlessness.

989
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It was very much like being in space.

990
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So that was cool.

991
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But it was so.

992
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
After all, you think.

993
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay.

994
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah.

995
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah.

996
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It was like.

997
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Okay.

998
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That was.

999
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That was.

1000
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Do they expect you to sleep or.

1001
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No.

1002
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What is it?

1003
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Did you go in into a.

1004
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So what about you turn over and you like.

1005
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Well, actually it was nice because you can really stretch and stretch in ways

1006
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that you've never stretched before because.

1007
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You're waitless.

1008
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So I think.

1009
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So I could really stretch.

1010
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah.

1011
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think it is.

1012
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

1013
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I think it is.

1014
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm paying.

1015
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah.

1016
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I think they come.

1017
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I came up with it.

1018
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because of people with pain.

1019
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah.

1020
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I think they'll be very.

1021
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I mean, it felt nice.

1022
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That was nice.

1023
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But it's just, but you're not going to fall asleep in the.

1024
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Luke warm salt water.

1025
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Been.

1026
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Come on.

1027
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And it's dark.

1028
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah.

1029
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So.

1030
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But then.

1031
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

1032
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
There's more.

1033
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The guy.

1034
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The guy.

1035
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And the guy said, hey.

1036
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Got a cigarette.

1037
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

1038
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Thank you.

1039
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thanks.

1040
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

1041
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I took a shower.

1042
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Have you seen the showers here?

1043
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
No.

1044
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It's a fucking car wash.

1045
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, you have.

1046
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You have lower nozzle.

1047
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And you can control the temperature.

1048
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And it's a big shower.

1049
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I mean, big shit.

1050
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
This is what we when we build our house.

1051
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
This is what this is what I want.

1052
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
They could do the middle section.

1053
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah.

1054
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And then you can determine if you want.

1055
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, my.

1056
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
From for the top section.

1057
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Or if you want the big dome.

1058
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah.

1059
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And that was really nice.

1060
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That was really nice.

1061
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That was really nice.

1062
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah.

1063
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I stood there for a long time.

1064
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Touching myself.

1065
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, God.

1066
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I didn't.

1067
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I didn't.

1068
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I didn't need disgusting.

1069
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, my God.

1070
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay.

1071
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm going to San Francisco.

1072
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And we're going to.

1073
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I guess we'll pick up the key and go.

1074
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Look at the place at the pad.

1075
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah.

1076
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay.

1077
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And then we'll go find.

1078
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And we'll go buy a sleeper sofa.

1079
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah.

1080
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We can stay.

1081
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No.

1082
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No.

1083
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No.

1084
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No.

1085
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No.

1086
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
No.

1087
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
No.

1088
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
No.

1089
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No.

1090
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No.

1091
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
No.

1092
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
No.

1093
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No.

1094
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
No.

1095
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
No.

1096
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Oh, didn't we?

1097
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
No.

1098
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Didn't mention it.

1099
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We went when we were in New York.

1100
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We felt a little bit better the last day.

1101
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Excuse me.

1102
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Now you were sick.

1103
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I was sick.

1104
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I was still not.

1105
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But we.

1106
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We'd already agreed to have dinner.

1107
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We agreed to have dinner with our old neighbors.

1108
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And New Jersey where we used to live in Verona.

1109
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And that's actually where Christina grew up.

1110
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And where she went to school.

1111
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And where you.

1112
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, actually, that's the house that you always talk about.

1113
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

1114
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The house you grew up in there.

1115
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
My roots.

1116
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And where Christina was born.

1117
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So she wanted to see it.

1118
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And she wanted to go back.

1119
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because she was always talking about it.

1120
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And we did.

1121
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And these neighbors are very nice people.

1122
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Very nice.

1123
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Dennis and Barbara.

1124
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
She's a French teacher.

1125
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
She goes to France a lot.

1126
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And she's.

1127
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
She's nice.

1128
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And he's too.

1129
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And they invited us.

1130
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And we went to a restaurant with them.

1131
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And then we went to the.

1132
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And we were.

1133
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We went to the monument of the 911.

1134
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And it had.

1135
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Because they used to use one place where you could look over all of New York.

1136
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I used to go with my dad a lot.

1137
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So now they brought us up there.

1138
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And the walls.

1139
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's a cliff.

1140
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah.

1141
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And yeah.

1142
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
They put walls up.

1143
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No.

1144
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No.

1145
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There was always a wall.

1146
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that's where you go up.

1147
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Like on Santa night.

1148
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And there are a lot of.

1149
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah.

1150
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And you take something to drink.

1151
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's a lot of guys.

1152
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
We bring their girlfriend there.

1153
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah.

1154
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
To sit in a car and stare at New York.

1155
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah.

1156
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You can see it.

1157
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's beautiful.

1158
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's gorgeous.

1159
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's a treasure.

1160
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's on Eagle Rock Reservation.

1161
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah.

1162
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I have to show you something because there's something very beautiful.

1163
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And you can explain.

1164
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You can explain Christina.

1165
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Well, the whole wall was a lot of the all people that died in the 911.

1166
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And they had a big statue.

1167
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Where had a big eel on top.

1168
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And then it looked like a book.

1169
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And it had.

1170
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The firefighters and the policemen that died in the whole thing.

1171
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And they had made out of candle wax somewhere around there.

1172
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And they had two twin towers out of all the candles.

1173
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
People put there and that flowers everywhere.

1174
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I was really sad because you would read the list.

1175
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And you saw like families.

1176
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And you could read a whole story out of it because you saw.

1177
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You saw like a two year old and then the monster.

1178
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

1179
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And you thought, oh, they probably brought them up there to the top of the twin towers.

1180
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then the thing collapsed.

1181
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah.

1182
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Ah, horrible.

1183
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And you could see people from a month later from everywhere.

1184
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
From England, from Sweden.

1185
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And I mean, so many people from all over the world.

1186
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah.

1187
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And he said something that kind of many things.

1188
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
All these people can imagine they don't exist anymore.

1189
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I thought that's really weird.

1190
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That they all died that same day.

1191
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
They don't exist anymore.

1192
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And especially that if you if it's evening.

1193
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's around about 11 o'clock.

1194
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's a beautiful warm night.

1195
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And you can see New York.

1196
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then when people tell you these things.

1197
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And we were staring at all those names.

1198
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And you know, something's happening inside.

1199
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And think, what a pity.

1200
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What a pity.

1201
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Hmm.

1202
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah.

1203
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So that was a beautiful evening.

1204
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

1205
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And also because we, uh, Christina saw her, um,

1206
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm a much childhood best friend, best friend, Leila.

1207
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh, sorry.

1208
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't know.

1209
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That was fun.

1210
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Um, so we had a, we had a wonderful night.

1211
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
We had a wonderful night to see.

1212
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And I think we.

1213
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Uh, it's good to see your old neighbors.

1214
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah.

1215
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And now to stay in contact with them.

1216
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Definitely.

1217
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And, um, so New York was a bust.

1218
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Except for that.

1219
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That was nice.

1220
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But well, we forgot how hot it could be.

1221
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And it was out of the hottest time.

1222
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Because there's, that we always turned right when we walk out the door of the hotel.

1223
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Right.

1224
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh, because we already explained the last time that it was a boutique hotel.

1225
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So the boutique hotel.

1226
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That means also sort of strange healthy, not so good for 14 year old food.

1227
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But you know, whatever you try.

1228
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But it's not what you expect.

1229
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And it's not much.

1230
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Just a pile of healthy things.

1231
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And I like it very much.

1232
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But I wanted, we had a little kitchen in the room.

1233
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So I was, um, my plan was to get some groceries.

1234
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And, you know, make some nice snacks and, and sandwiches.

1235
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And you do feel good.

1236
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah.

1237
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah.

1238
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And, you know, make some eggs or anything or sandwiches.

1239
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And, and buy some good cheese.

1240
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
For, of course.

1241
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And, but we couldn't find anything.

1242
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
There was no soup.

1243
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
There wasn't.

1244
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Delia.

1245
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The last day.

1246
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The last day.

1247
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Instead of going right, we went left.

1248
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Take a walk in the woods.

1249
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And I'm walking left.

1250
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Well, actually, across the street from, on the left side,

1251
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
was a beautiful, amish supermarket with rude,

1252
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
the most delicious fresh food you've ever seen.

1253
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah.

1254
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I was so angry.

1255
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You said that yourself.

1256
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Wow.

1257
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
All those days.

1258
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know, with fruit and fish and salad and beautiful,

1259
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
big tomatoes and cookies and fresh crispy bread.

1260
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah.

1261
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah.

1262
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah.

1263
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Your mommy instinct makes you very angry now.

1264
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah.

1265
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I really, I was very angry with myself.

1266
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You saved us a lot of heartburn.

1267
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm sorry about that.

1268
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
No, no.

1269
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

1270
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
He did.

1271
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He had a lot of heartburn.

1272
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You mean your acid reflux disease?

1273
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It really, really came back.

1274
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah.

1275
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You could take it with this pill.

1276
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And then one week, it'll start working.

1277
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Or you could just drink some goddamn maylocks right now.

1278
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yeah.

1279
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
What you had a big bottle of maylocks,

1280
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
maylocks.

1281
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Next to my bed.

1282
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then we bring it on the flight, too.

1283
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah.

1284
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
First we're like, like, swig and maylocks.

1285
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We knew this.

1286
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And I have to say, being back in America,

1287
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you really need the maylocks here.

1288
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's all.

1289
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I didn't want to say it was a part of the maylocks plan.

1290
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Everybody probably has that problem.

1291
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because every had there is a commercial totally.

1292
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That says something about acid reflux.

1293
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah.

1294
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't know.

1295
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Everybody has that.

1296
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's all eyes out.

1297
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And I can't imagine why I've seen the, the,

1298
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
you know, the dining food and, and, you know,

1299
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
portions are big.

1300
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Very big.

1301
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Very big.

1302
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So all this has a small cell.

1303
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It comes.

1304
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's like, the rest of your body.

1305
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's like the rest of your body.

1306
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Those big fat onion rings.

1307
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But how friendly are Americans?

1308
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They are very, very nice.

1309
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They're very nice.

1310
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
They're very nice.

1311
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Remember?

1312
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They're very relaxed and nice.

1313
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm very happy.

1314
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

1315
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So simple.

1316
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah.

1317
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I think I'm going to seem pretty happy.

1318
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Very happy.

1319
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah.

1320
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah.

1321
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I like that too.

1322
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And I think when I look at them, I think,

1323
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
or they have no clue.

1324
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Do they?

1325
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You mean?

1326
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't know.

1327
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's just like.

1328
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What?

1329
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You can't be happy?

1330
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
No.

1331
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's almost that they're not,

1332
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and it's not in reality.

1333
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's sort of a, they all feel like they want to feel like this.

1334
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
No.

1335
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No.

1336
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What I'm in America, I feel like I'm in a movie.

1337
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah.

1338
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
They think they're in a movie.

1339
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's our culture.

1340
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

1341
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I know.

1342
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's a group thing.

1343
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We have to be happy.

1344
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Like you're in Laguna Beach.

1345
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This is how we watch that episode.

1346
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, please.

1347
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh, my God, Brett.

1348
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, I'm too lazy to articulate.

1349
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, my God.

1350
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
They talk really slow.

1351
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, I know.

1352
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But that's, that's a show about teenagers trying to be grown up, which is just frightening.

1353
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You don't like that, dude.

1354
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's a frightening program.

1355
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No, but it's just not.

1356
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's bad for the general population and general health.

1357
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I think the sweet 16 show was just as bad.

1358
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's bad.

1359
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That's bad.

1360
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That's really bad.

1361
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah.

1362
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
All right.

1363
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But anyway, it's an amazing country.

1364
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Pretty groovy, huh?

1365
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Wait till you see San Francisco.

1366
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yep.

1367
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Did you have a scene yet?

1368
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
No.

1369
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You're going to love it.

1370
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Only little part here.

1371
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

1372
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No.

1373
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is, this is Berkeley.

1374
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's not San Francisco.

1375
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is near Oktown.

1376
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah.

1377
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okland.

1378
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
What's Okland?

1379
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Okland?

1380
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Where M.C. hammers from?

1381
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Oktown?

1382
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No.

1383
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Hmm.

1384
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okland.

1385
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
A lot of hippies.

1386
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think it's going to be here.

1387
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
If I look outside.

1388
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The poppers.

1389
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's going to be clear tomorrow.

1390
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

1391
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I think so too.

1392
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I mean, I wish we had missed very missed the meteor shower yesterday.

1393
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But the what?

1394
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The meteor shower.

1395
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh yeah.

1396
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I wanted to write them.

1397
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I couldn't wake up.

1398
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No.

1399
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You think I can sleep tonight in your bed?

1400
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Except you're going to Christina?

1401
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yes.

1402
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I would lie.

1403
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Are you dry?

1404
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I feel moist.

1405
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I have not emanated any sap for two nights.

1406
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, yes.

1407
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Casting.

1408
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
No talk of sap on this.

1409
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
No, you're more than welcome to join me.

1410
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Me and my friend.

1411
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, it's something to sock on it.

1412
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No.

1413
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
All right.

1414
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Christina.

1415
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You close it up.

1416
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'll go over there and turn it off.

1417
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, wait.

1418
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
No.

1419
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So ended up.

1420
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Remember it was the anniversary show.

1421
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

1422
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, kids.

1423
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This is the curry signing off from the anniversary show.

1424
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
We're glad we could waste your time.

1425
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Once again with a.

1426
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Good.

1427
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Very much.

1428
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's right.

1429
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I hope we irritate you just as much last time.

1430
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Peace out man.
