1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you doing?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It is Thursday.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What do we have?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
January 6, 2005.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Once again from sunny South Beach, Florida.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is your daily source code.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not, I'm current.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Using the bellipers parting together here in the sunshine.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I'm not kidding.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It really is true.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Having a great time.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How are you doing?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I want to give you an update on stuff.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But not too long because you're going to do a special type of source code today.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Since, well, I guess basically it'd be just boring to boring or boring.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
boring, boring, boring, boring to tell you that we had another great day.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Really got somewhere.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I had some breakthrough moments.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I had some fun.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I had some coffee.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I guess that would be kind of boring to get it over and over again.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hey, guess what?

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is the broadband at home.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Apparently actually really works.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I haven't had the balls yet to try and walk Christina through it all.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Because what I'm worried about is that it's not going to work or something will happen.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I won't be able to get her back up and running on the modem connection.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But someone from the easy net called the Patricia today and said, hey, you know, everything working

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
okay.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She said, well, I haven't actually plugged everything in yet.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So maybe a little bit later.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Christina also had her first full day of school today at the new school.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She went kind of like an orientation the other day.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I just spoke to her and she said she's having a great time.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And that makes that puts a smile on my face boy.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let me tell you because when your kid goes to school and enjoys it and comes home smiling,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that's great.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Particularly after my god.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She was out of school for four weeks.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know, if you take a Christmas and New Year's in Do account and a week for the move and everything.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, that was, you know, to have your kids in the home going, I'm so bored.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Please send me to school and when she actually goes to school, she likes it.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's the kind of stuff that, well, that's the kind of stuff that you want to celebrate with the drum cadence.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, exactly.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's what we got to do.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ha ha ha.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ha ha.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ha ha.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ha ha.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ha ha.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ha ha.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ha ha.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ha ha.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ha ha.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ha ha.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ha ha.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ha ha.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ha ha.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ha ha.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Ha ha.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ha ha.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ha ha.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ha.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh man, I love it.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And it looks like we're actually going to get the drum cadence of the day set up on its own feed.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
had a little email exchange about that and we're working on that.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm not going to do, by the way, you can get the drum cadence of the day through openpodcast.org.

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,520
So if you subscribe to that, you'll get it automatically and the whole point is just to get

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,360
it on its own feed so you can subscribe to only that without getting anything else.

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
So I'm not going to play that today in the source code because we have a different type of show.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,320
We, even though it's Dave Weiner, Ron Bloom and Adam Curry here in Miami, we're, you know,

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,680
hanging and figuring stuff out, having talks and it's also, you know, don't tell Patricia

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
or Christina, but, you know, I'm really enjoying the sunshine and the rest and it's kind of like

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,680
a little mini vacation in a way, not that I needed one, but it is kind of nice to be totally

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,720
involved with yourself and what you're doing and not have any responsibility for anyone else.

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,640
That's kind of quote, except for my partners in this case, which is different than my family.

78
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:10,080
And throughout the week that we've been here, Madge Weinstein has been a part of, you know,

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,240
a lot of what we're talking about, Madge will be often used as an example and it's really just

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,120
because Madge Weinstein's yeast radio, I don't have to tell you what it is because you've heard,

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,360
you've heard Madge Weinstein on this show before, I'm sure you've listened and, you know,

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,000
like it or not, Madge Weinstein would never work on traditional broadcast, would not work on radio,

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,760
it does not work, you can't do that, not anywhere in the world really, I don't think.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,520
The outrage would be just too big because air waves are not controlled by URI, you would think so,

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,760
you would think that we own the spectrum in the air, airways, but we don't, not really,

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,560
or we don't have, we may own it, but we don't have control over it. It's other people who control that,

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,200
and there's lobby groups, et cetera, and it's very hard to keep stuff on the, look at the United

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,840
States, you know, freedom of speech is one of the most important things that we value in the United

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,640
States, yet there's all kinds of stuff that you can't say, and this is Howard Stern's major,

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
you know, I don't think, he's not in for the money, you know, that's basically that's his,

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,840
if he had to go out and say, no, I think the money is important to him, but it's, it's not the

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,040
number one thing for him in this satellite radio deal, and we're just having breakfast, just got back

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,720
from breakfast, and we saw a news item running in the, in the restaurant with Howard Stern,

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
and he had the whole crew there and Robin, and you know, they were handing out these these

95
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,560
serious radio boom boxes, which is apparently the only way you'll be able to listen to Howard

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Stern, if you're not in your car, you know, you have to say, so he's now hawking the boom boxes,

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,680
which are ugly, ugly, fugly, and he'll be doing that for a year, you know, he's also getting

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,560
stock in the company, so of course it's logical, it's for his own pocket, but he's concentrating on,

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
now he's selling devices when he wants to be passing along as a message, so anyway,

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,760
when when we stumbled across East Radio Madge Weinstein, this to me was like,

101
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,280
yeah, this is the kind of stuff that belongs in our world of podcasting, as an example, because

102
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,480
you don't have to only do this, but Madge has ideas, Madge has thoughts and Madge communicates,

103
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,680
and Madge is probably, or no, I know that Madge does what she does because she wants to try and make

104
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,760
the world a little bit better, so you have to kind of look through the delivery mechanism,

105
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,760
and there's the wonderful payload that she carries with her message, so it's important that

106
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,200
we recognize this, it's important that it's important that you know that she's been a part

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:07:00,240
of a lot of my thought process over the past couple days, so of course, said, well, why don't I just

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,480
call her and have a chat and just see if I can get some more information and share that with the source

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,600
code listeners, so I did that, and I did it, well, we tried to set it up a couple of ways,

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,720
try to use Skype, I don't know what the fuck is, it may be my computer, but something is very wrong,

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,760
I still can't get my email, which makes me think that it is actually, well, something's wrong with

112
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,560
my computer clearly, because other people can get email on this network, so I just haven't had

113
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,080
time to troubleshoot it, I'm going through the web interface, which is a lot of fun, Skype blows,

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,840
Skype blows fucking chunks, what on missed opportunity? You know, it still crashes, now you can

115
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,480
select a different sound input, but it's still crashes, you know, so I have everything set up the way I

116
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:47,120
want it, I want to record and it crashes, because it, and it actually, for a nanosecond, I was able to see

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
an error message before it crashed, but I've just haven't gotten into it, it's not working right,

118
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,640
it doesn't work for me, it may work very well on Windows, but it doesn't work on the Mac,

119
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,320
so I resorted to my cell phone, which you can use to record conversations, so the quality won't be,

120
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,480
you know, 100%, but still, it's quite amazing that all I had to do was hit a button,

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,720
I was recording my conversation, after the conversation, hit a button, it blew too through

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,320
my laptop, then what I did is I actually did some processing out of trying to make it sound a

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,120
little bit, a little bit better, so a little bit of compression and a few tricks that I put in,

124
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:32,080
but it's bar like two edits when I had to stop the recording, it's the whole conversation I had.

125
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,280
We're going to get to that in a second, there's one other thing I was really happy to receive

126
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,920
an email from Barry Coral who starts off with saying that she's happy with the things when I

127
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,240
mom are better, you have no idea how good they are Barry. She knows in my Miami, but she said,

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,520
I want you to know, oh, it says, I know so much about, okay, oh, I miss Reddit,

129
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,960
maybe it's just read it to you, they'll be easier, of course it's in the show notes, but you

130
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,920
don't have those, next to you, not do you, or most of you don't. Hey Adam, glad that things with

131
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
your mom are getting better, I know you're in Miami and hope you're doing okay. I know so much

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
about you because I've been getting so many emails from your listeners and selling many CDs to

133
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,800
them since you started playing my record every day, there are more. So I want to thank you,

134
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,040
thanks for the support wish you all the very best and 2005 for you and your family, thank you for

135
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,640
making a difference, regards Barry Coral. Well, you know what, it's working and that, I've had

136
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,600
a smile on my face since the moment I saw that email because it's working, the loop is closing,

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,120
we're making it work, you know, you have people creating Barry Corals a software developer,

138
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,120
she's creating software, she distributes it on the CD and the, in digital form on the, on the

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,600
internet and I'm a user and I'm sharing that and other people sharing it and guess what,

140
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,520
without digital rights management, without, you know, without fucked up contracts that

141
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,880
leave Barry Coral with nothing, she's making money and, and it's working, it's fucking working

142
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,160
and I got to tell you, I'm proud of that. You guys should be too, to me, so we could do some

143
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
shit here. So let's play some Barry Coral before we get to Madge Wine, so here's the world you

144
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,880
call home. Let's run for out new confessions of an indie girl and you can buy it Barry Coral.com.

145
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Yeah, you locked the door until you buy some comfort from your old booths. Have your listen to you,

146
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:51,920
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

147
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:51,760
yeah, there's a lump of good music, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Jan ona, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I sure do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I, yeah

148
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Yeah, if you know you found a found someone to speak up for you

149
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Yeah, I'll wait for you to elevate away to get you through

150
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,760
It's as if somebody's somewhere low close were twice

151
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,760
When you listen to you

152
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,760
I put an up stereo out of you and I need you

153
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,760
All out of the world you come home, you listen to your own

154
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I put an up stereo out of you and I need you

155
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,760
All out of the world you come home

156
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,760
All out of the world you come home

157
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
All out of the world

158
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Hello, Matt Weinstein, how are you?

159
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
I'm good, thank you

160
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm so happy that we could jump this call because I wanted you to know that I've been waiting for you

161
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
And I'm so happy you have arrived

162
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Okay, are we on the air yet by the way?

163
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Of course we're on the air

164
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Oh, but I think that's what you're trying to call on the other one

165
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
If you're hearing a beep, that's probably my phone

166
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Beeping to let you know that I'm secretly recording our conversation

167
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Okay, so you started you used radio in 1996

168
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
I had no idea so and was it the same format?

169
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Were you doing the same type of show?

170
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
It was actually mostly about vaginal use

171
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
We had a show called East Talk

172
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Is this a big problem, vaginally?

173
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Oh sure, you know, it's amazing because 95% of the women in this country suffer from vaginal use

174
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,760
But you hear all you hear about is that fucking breast cancer with those dodgy and yellow ribbons

175
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
vaginal use just as deadly

176
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,760
vaginal use is more deadly because it can cause vomiting, diarrhea

177
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
It can cause all kinds of terrible things and it itches

178
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Cancer doesn't itch

179
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,760
vaginal yeast itches and it causes a burning sensation and it's very annoying

180
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I mean cancer, you got it and that's it

181
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,760
You hardly even know you haven't half the time, simply you're in chemo

182
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Well, you're such an expert on this thing

183
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,760
I have been campaigning in my crusade against vaginal yeast

184
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,760
with my first perennial match once again, yoga against yeast it's on

185
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,760
We're going to yoga nonstop until starting earth day and so there's a cure for vaginal use

186
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Okay, well, you can count on my support, you know that

187
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Oh, thank you very much

188
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
So I saw that you I don't know how long you've been doing the video

189
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
The video clip

190
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Now the video journals I've been actually doing video journals since the 2000

191
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
So that has been doing for about 40 years now

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,760
And I started doing that because I was doing video advocacy for an art for a friend of mine who was an art students

193
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,760
And she required that everybody do a live journal

194
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Right, live journal was first learning in order to keep them sort of journals of the filmmaking process

195
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,760
I was lazy, I was too lazy to make a written journal, so I did a video

196
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah, because that's what I preferred to do

197
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,760
So I'm glad to hear that that's sort of taking off as well, but in a slow at a slower pace since it's really nothing to play those things on

198
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I got to tell you imagine the yeast radio that's your platform

199
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
That's where that's where you need to do it

200
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
You don't understand

201
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm sitting here, I'm sitting here in Florida with Dave and Ron, you know that because you're smart, you've been following

202
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Right, sure, sure

203
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
And by the way, you're totally right about Dave

204
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
That he's kind of a pot

205
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
No, you didn't say he was a pot, he's not a pot

206
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,760
No, I didn't mean that he's a pot so I meant that he's very smart, but you know that he can be a little bit overbearing

207
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
What you said was pretty much right on

208
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
And we love him, I love him for it

209
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
And by the way, he really likes you

210
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,760
And he wants many more of his psychic reading, and he wants to know

211
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
He wants you to be compared again to Nicole Kidman that really helped

212
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Well, I would think it could do so, but he hasn't been podcasting very much lately

213
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
And I'd be happy to comment on it if he would put something out there, you know

214
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh, you need to love back, because what you're saying

215
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,760
Yeah, I need something, I need to hear and talk about something

216
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Oh, for the reading of the big B

217
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Yeah, I just need to hear him, I got to do the second reading

218
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
In order to do it, I need to hear him talking

219
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
That's some crap, talking about the McDonalds, for example

220
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,760
It's looking for Wi-Fi, when in fact we all know all he really wanted is a goddamn double-season

221
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Looking for Wi-Fi and a McDonalds

222
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
That's bullshit

223
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
That looks for Wi-Fi and a goddamn McDonalds

224
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Or a goddamn hamburger

225
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Oh man, I'm a flurry

226
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
I love you

227
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,760
I remember that somebody told me in Holland, they called it a McFlurry

228
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I'm a flurry now, because that's learning means like masturbator

229
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Something you know about this, no, no, no, no

230
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,760
A slurry is a slut that does that, no, no, no

231
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
What's your background, man?

232
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,760
What's your background, man?

233
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,760
You know, I think you said, well, I was hurt

234
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Yeah?

235
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Well, I was going to say, I mean, you sound like you have a technical background, I mean, certainly it sounds like you got it

236
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Either you're doing the gusses doing, but someone's rigged up your stuff

237
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Well, you got nice equipment

238
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
I do it all myself, bless you doesn't do anything

239
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,760
She's got the early Alzheimer's, early on set Alzheimer's

240
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
She's lucky if she can get onto the toilet without self

241
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,760
So I have to do it all myself, plus she lives in Florida, she's actually very close to where you are

242
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
And God, I don't have to see her very often, yeah, I'm down there in Miami

243
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,760
At least once every two months, it's a shame we didn't cross heads this side

244
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,760
But I'm here through throughout the weekend, I'll get you a hotel room, come on

245
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Listen, listen, not all of us are, you know, early retirement baby boom.com millionaires

246
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Bruce Harris, which is helicopters in your airplanes

247
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Some of us have to write a goddamn bike chair

248
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
No, it was bare feet

249
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, bare feet is clogged

250
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
So technical background

251
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Yes, so I do it, I do it myself, I was a DJ for what, you know, I'm an old lady

252
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,760
I was one of the founders of the little fair, I am a lesbian, lesbian, and known to be technical

253
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,760
And I'm very technically competent, so I do work for a record label and I manage a girl band

254
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
God is my excuse

255
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Can I play that on my podcast?

256
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Well, no, they're kind of sucking right now

257
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
So I'm really embarrassed to let anybody see of them

258
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
However, I do have another girl that I manage, her name is Patty Elvis

259
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,760
She is the best Elvis impersonator

260
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I don't have to be recording

261
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
She's a female and she's a lesbian

262
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm a lesbian, don't worry, we're a month lesbian, sure, man

263
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,760
So I'll be with her, I'm Saturday, and be doing a podcast with Patty Elvis

264
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Excellent, she's a very hot guy

265
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,760
And so yes, I'm very busy, but basically the label gives me my technical background

266
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I do a lot of computer work on my own, and I'm just an old guy

267
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Anyway, as I said earlier, I've been waiting for you to show up

268
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
I knew that you were coming, I knew that you were coming to podcasts

269
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I didn't know who you were or what you're going to be like

270
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
But I think you belong in solidly in this community

271
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
And I hope you stay, and whatever I can do to help, let me know

272
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Thank you very much, well you can keep listening to me

273
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
And you can keep talking about me because I need more listeners

274
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Because this thing is going to grow

275
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm still waiting for the big explosion when I don't have to explain to people that a podcast is

276
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
And then they treat me like it's my burden to tell them how to click a dog there

277
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
And mouse and download a fucking MP3 file

278
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Why everyone on earth can't do this as easily as they can change the channel

279
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
It's completely beyond me

280
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
You know, you need to get a lot easier

281
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Okay, so what do we need to do to make it easier

282
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
You know, you need to be able to stick the iPod in and you get your

283
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,760
You know, to tell you the truth, what it needs is it needs to be part of iTunes

284
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
It has to be part of iTunes

285
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
How about, how about it has to be part of the iPod itself

286
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Beyond iPod itself, I don't know

287
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
But it needs to be, you know, have an interface

288
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
But if you have to load Linux in order to get it to be an interface

289
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Forget it, that's not going to work

290
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Somebody needs to talk to Apple is what I'm saying

291
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
I realize they may not go for it because they need to sell more content

292
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Apple is not going to want to talk to us

293
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
They're not?

294
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
No, come on, you reviewed the inside

295
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Well, I hate that set

296
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,760
What about a plug-in like those native from the screen savers

297
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
What you have iTunes plug-ins, why couldn't it be that?

298
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Yeah, I will, you know

299
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I think it needs to operate differently

300
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I think you need to deal, it's sort of like mail

301
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
You want it to be able to show that it's in red

302
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
And you want to know that you've heard this already or not

303
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
And you want it to be able to be disposed of automatically

304
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Oh, really? I wouldn't want that at all

305
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Unless they talk about you or me, of course

306
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Well, that should be flashing

307
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Right

308
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Well, I love to talk to you about this stuff

309
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
And your input is really important

310
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
And your podcast is incredibly

311
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
How long are you doing it every day or five days a week

312
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm doing it every day

313
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Sometimes I want to do it more

314
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
But I feel like I'll burn out

315
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to, I do any more of it

316
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Do you think I should do any more of these talking while I'm on the toilet

317
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Because it seems like there's other people doing that

318
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Well, first of all, I really like

319
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
The lovelier microphone

320
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I do that in the beginning

321
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,760
When I, when I still was rich and had the castle

322
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I gave way half of my fortune

323
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Oh, I don't know

324
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,760
And I really like when you're, you're walking around

325
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,760
You're doing, you're in your space and whatever

326
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,760
And you know, the shit cast, you know, I, yeah

327
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I mean, what I like is you'll be, you know, unclogging your toilet

328
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
And all of a sudden something really beautiful

329
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
It's like, you know, the opposite of software

330
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
You know, you're, you're dealing with shit on one end

331
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
But something beautiful comes out the other

332
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
That was the sink that I'm clogged

333
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
And you know, I, I wanted to tell the general audience

334
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
I suppose I can make this announcement now

335
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
But I get unclogged the sink

336
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Right after I ended the podcast yesterday

337
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
I successfully unclogged the sink

338
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
I knocked down the room where all the night

339
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
And it's meant we're sitting and smoking and spending my assessments

340
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
My $400 a month on assessments

341
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
If they were altering their smoking for they

342
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Generally enough, gave me the plunger so I could plunge it myself

343
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
To avoid the $15 charge

344
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
And I did, right?

345
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
So, yeah, as long as you keep, you know, talking about the political stuff

346
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
And the social stuff and, right?

347
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
I love that, you know, that's what it is

348
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Yeah, I said today on my podcast

349
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
It's like, as his Joan Rivers Howard Stern

350
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
And Rush Limbaugh had a massive orgy

351
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Like, you could be the result of that

352
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
That's so sweet of you to say that because I was thinking

353
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I feel bad for Howard, because Howard is one of my role models

354
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
But I know, if he ever heard my show, he's going to be so goddamn angry

355
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
But I got to say, come to him already

356
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Exactly, exactly, and you know what?

357
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
I hate to say it

358
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
I said today, if I had $500 million, I would, I would

359
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Ask Howard Stern to come to podcast immediately

360
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
Here, here's $500 million

361
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
And don't have that, but he belongs here, he belongs here

362
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
But okay, so he can't talk about it

363
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
What's that, what's that beeping?

364
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
What beeping?

365
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Hello. Hello.

366
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
I hear a beeping, I don't know what the fuck that is, do you hear it?

367
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
No.

368
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
You know?

369
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
I'm not going to like a bomb.

370
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
I can't hear what you're saying, I'm going to hang up the phone

371
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
So you can call me back, I don't know if the interview's over

372
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,760
If it is to buy, but can you hear me now?

373
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I can't hear you.

374
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Okay, how about now?

375
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Who do you want to tell the phone, and it goes off every day

376
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
It's technical office, I never changed it.

377
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Okay, no problem.

378
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Are we still recording?

379
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Yeah, I just wanted to finish up for, and just say,

380
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Thank you very much for coming on the source code

381
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,760
You know, keep being mad, it kills me every single time I hear you.

382
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
You also need to be anything else but mad.

383
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,760
But thank you so much, it is a profound pleasure, especially having watched

384
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
You all through middle age.

385
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Now I get to see you through menopause too.

386
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
I can tell you how touching it is.

387
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
We can hold hands together, we can do it.

388
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Yes.

389
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
You know, are you older than I am? I'm 40, are you older than I am?

390
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I am actually, I'm in my 50s, but I don't know.

391
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,760
I don't know what my age, and I don't really talk my age, but if you saw me, you know, I don't look at the

392
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Pictures, I saw. You used to date at the moment, what?

393
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I used to date at the moment in 1967.

394
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,760
He doesn't really consider it dating, but we had a short affair in 1967, so that's

395
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,760
to give you an idea of all day. Now after why I look young, that's because I'm timeless.

396
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
You are.

397
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
And I don't drink, I don't drink at all.

398
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
I don't drink either, that's what makes, that's what keeps you young, looking at your skin,

399
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
keeps looking beautiful, drinking.

400
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
That's true, but you do love the reference, I don't do that neither.

401
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Yeah, but you know, one of the days, I'm not going to kill me.

402
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,760
It's fine, as long as you don't end up with a bad lady like me, because I ended up in a mental hospital

403
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,760
because I, indeed, I'm tired of pills and became morbidly obese at the same time.

404
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,760
No, no, no, that's not my plan.

405
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Yeah, that's a warning to certain people to stay away from the McDonald's.

406
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
I have one final question.

407
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
What do you want to be when you grow up?

408
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
A big fact like.

409
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
There you have it.

410
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,760
The Madge wine steam on the daily source code.

411
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Madge already created a did a podcast after we did this, and that's the current one that's up.

412
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,760
And of course, you can get that from the show notes, but it's magic underscore Weinstein dot live journal dot com,

413
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
which I guess will soon be six apart or something like that.

414
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Okay, so maybe we have a little bit of idea about magic.

415
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,760
There's a couple things as I listen to this again.

416
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,760
That I realized one, I don't think Madge actually knows about iPodder.

417
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Because as I listen to her describe basically iPodderex or any number of iPodders.

418
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:03,760
It sounded like, you know, either she doesn't like the replication or the duplication of having the same interface in iTunes as in iPodderex or.

419
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
I'll have to ask her about that.

420
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,760
And also that this really is Madge, you know, it's hard to be anything but Madge.

421
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
I heard her actually say that, and that's what works.

422
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Folks, it's a reality, it's real life, it's why it's the power of pure intellect every body.

423
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Internet.

424
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Oh yeah.

425
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
And that's it for your source code for today.

426
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Maybe we'll interview an artist tomorrow.

427
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,760
I've been thinking about talking to maybe we'll get Leanne Westover from the list of his videos on the on the phone.

428
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,760
I talked to her about what podcasting is doing for her.

429
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,760
But we know it's selling some CDs, which is really, really cool.

430
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
And maybe we'll talk to very cool one of these days.

431
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
I want to thank very much for tuning in.

432
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Of course comments are welcome through Adam Curry, Adam at Curry.com, sorry.

433
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Or my weblog www.curdie.com.

434
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm going to go find my compatrails and we're going to go hang out some more here in Southern Florida.

435
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,760
We're talking soon. Take care. Bye bye.

436
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Thanks for watching.
