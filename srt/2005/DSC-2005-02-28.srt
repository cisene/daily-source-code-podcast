1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Source Code, February 28th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Autistic, it's Adam Curry.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes indeed, it is the last day of February.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The power of the door.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Everybody, how you doing? It's been a while, but I'm back.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Back at the cottage. This is your deadly source code.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today is Monday, it's the 20th, February 2005.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Adam Curry, bringing you the best when it comes to mash-ups,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
pod save music and all kinds of crap about podcasting.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, then again, is it really crap?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, you know, we got some shit going on.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Boy, it's going to be back right now.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm actually, I'm all alone in the cottage.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Patricia's off for a two-day piz trip, yep.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You know, I'm home and she leaves.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She'll be back Wednesday, so I'm holding down the fort here,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
keeping the home fires burning.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Christina's off at school.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It is 10 minutes to 12, and I am so ready to bring you another source code.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's great to be back in the big green chair.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Got my smoke here, and a little bit of tea.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's right. Nothing usual, sir.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I kind of sensed out, I have to be quite honest.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Maybe it's time to change the,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the bylink on curry.com.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Maybe it should start selling something else.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
By the way, I have sold double digits in the sensio machine arena.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That means I've sold my latest check.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My latest check is 23 sensio coffee machines,

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
countless coffee pods.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Somehow the stuff seems to be working, you know?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It really does.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You talk about something on your podcast.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You make sure that you have a way to sell something on the website.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
People actually do come back and buy it.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's great. It's what we call a business model.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And boy, there's a lot of them floating around these days, unbelievable.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It seems like everyone's announcing a network or a hosting solution

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
or something of that matter, it is really,

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it's just catch and fire ever since the New York Times started talking about it.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We're all talking about how to make money with podcasting.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we've actually talked about that before.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We've talked about commercialization.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think that was three or four podcasts to go when I was in San Francisco.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Today, actually, I want to talk a little bit more about what producers are looking for,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
what we need, because I think that before we get to commercialization

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and selling advertising or sponsorships or underwriting or subscription,

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
something else I've been hearing a lot about.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
People looking for avenues to make their podcasts for pay only.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
For instance, rumor is that audible.com is going to be doing something which would make total sense

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
because at least on the Macintosh, I'm pretty sure it must work on Windows as well,

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
otherwise it would be pretty silly, but audible allows you to subscribe to programs

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to X amount per month and they, well, they don't automatically show up on your iPod.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You have to go into audible.com and download them, but they do have a billing mechanism,

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so that makes sense.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I'm sure that lots of people will be interested in providing their content that way.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Campy too long before Apple opens up iTunes for exactly the same reason.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I think there's going to be some interesting stuff coming up in the next couple of,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
well, couple of months, maybe even couple of weeks.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In fact, I was going to play this a little bit later on on the show, but mine is

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
well hit it now.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Welcome to the Bitter's Bill.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hi, Sam class.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My daddy.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My daddy.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My daddy.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is 2005, the year of the podcast.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can't be the first person to say it, but you know what's true.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This podcast thing is going to be gigantic.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh yeah.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You know, there's one thing that people consistently say to me when they know that I'm,

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
that I'm the guy who does the daily source code.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And by the way, it was pretty cool to be in the United States where I hadn't really been for a long time,

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and so many people know about podcasting, know about the source code,

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
know about what's going on.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's just, it's really been pretty much endearing,

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
but consistently, no matter where I go.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Someone will always say, dude, where do you get those mashups?

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And my answer usually is, I get them from Pimp Daddy'sit.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And email showed up this morning.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yo Curry, here's another track to kick start this new week.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I heard on the daily source code that people ask you where you get your mashups.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
As a collector, I can show you in your listeners some cool sites that you can link to on your weblog,

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
so people could explore the wonderful world of mashups themselves.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No worries.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The special ones are really hard to find, so there's always enough of this source code.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This track, the one I know about the playboy, was made by Fuego.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
One of the best in this kind, also one of Sid's personal favorites.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is a mashup between Janet Jackson and Therapy.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Many masses of, I want you back.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is one of the best ones he's ever heard of,

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and you can find that at Fuego.nl, of course.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is listed in the show notes, but I'll spell it for you.
