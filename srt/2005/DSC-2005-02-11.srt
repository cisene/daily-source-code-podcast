00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Daily source code February 11th 2005 transmitters. We don't need no stinking transmutes.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Get ready for the generation of rock and roll.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Augustine, it's Adam Curry.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, thank God it's Friday the 11th.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey everybody, how you doing?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's the Daily Source code almost at my usual time coming to you from the Curry Cottage.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're back in Guildford. We could go business trip to Amsterdam.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Nothing fun unfortunately. Just tending to the lawsuits. Oh yeah.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The power of the door is so important.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The court's just the man Holland is so incredibly fucked up.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And it's like two major lawsuits that have been going for it.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One has been going for almost three years and one for two years.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
One against me and one I'm against somebody else.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's like the court just has no time to keep saying, oh well, you know, come back at three months.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We'll talk about it there. Come back in another three months. We'll talk about it there.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's crazy.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course, it's all designed to let the lawyers wait, right?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Can't be any other way than that.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's actually not entirely fair.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But we do have a very strange system in the Netherlands.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not a jury system. It's a professional judge system.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Which means a guy or a lady decides what happens.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No jury.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And they're out of judges, which makes it even more interesting.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So what happens then? They have backup judges.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And guess what backup judges are? Yes, the lawyers.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a crazy ass system. This civil court system in the Netherlands is five.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Never mind. We got plenty to do here on the daily source code today,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because we've got to talk about plenty of stuff.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Techno bits got a hit test.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Of course, young police hit test, which is pretty much a daily at this point.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And some pod save from music on the way as well as I've got a mashup blind up for you.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to talk about dot Mac.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is Apple's hosting service that they pretty much sell alongside with every single Mac.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You know, the minute you booted it up, there's a dot Mac all over the place.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Which is not bad really if you consider that you can mount this gigabyte of drive space right on your desktop.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It gives you, you know, you can get your email through dot Mac.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And they got a lot of stuff. And it's the synchronization service for your backups.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But they also really do sell this dot Mac as a place where you can store your files and you can serve them up.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And ever since we ran into trouble with the 20 gigabit or 20 megabit per second pipe on the hosting that I was using,

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
which basically just started crapping out and people started dropping downloads all over the place.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I moved over to dot Mac and it's been working very, very well, except about a week ago,

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the shit started to happen. And we first noticed it when I got a whole bunch of emails from people using Doppler,

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
which is an excellent iPod or client, Doppler radio.net as we can download.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's for Windows only.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But it just was not downloading the daily source code.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And so I got in touch with Erwin, Erwin and Cindy, who are the Doppler team, both Dutch developers.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And actually if they're together or not, if they're a couple, it doesn't matter.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are certainly a development couple.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And they couldn't figure it out either.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And it looks, but what's happening, we found out is that when you send a request,

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and I'm not really well versed in this, so bear with me, when you send a request,

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
saying how large is the file that I'm about to download, which you do through a head request.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All of a sudden, it appears that Dot Mac is refusing to allow that type of request.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now, I know why Doppler radio is doing this.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Not every iPod or client will check before downloading how large the file is.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The reason why Doppler is doing it, as far as I know, is because they have resumable downloads,

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
another feature that we did ask for.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I certainly ask for it. And I think as well as a podcast community, so that, you know,

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
if something breaks in transit, these are large files, you know, we just love to have the iPodter.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
On the next time it runs around, just check and see if that file is accessible again,

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and then pick up the download wherever it left off.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, of course, it needs to know how big that file is.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, guess what, Dot Mac is now no longer allowing that.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, the iPodter clients that do that even Firefox, when you do a save link as, won't allow it,

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
because I guess Firefox also is looking for that data.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And Dot Mac is now literally throwing back a 403 error saying method not implemented.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hold on a second, let me get you the official.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Actually, let me, I can do it live here.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Was it say invalid method 403 invalid method transferred encoding chunked?

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's a great error method method.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, your transfer encoding was chunked dude.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It was all junky, but it didn't make it.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, what I've done is I've yesterday's show for the 10th February.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I put that on the old hosting server, which, of course, means it'll probably break as,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
as lots of people start to download it, but at least you'll get something,

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or hopefully you'll get a resumable download and eventually it will come in.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But this is a real problem that has just all of a sudden appeared on the radar screen,

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and it's not just a problem for me.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There's plenty of people hosting their podcasts and other binary or media files on,

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
particularly media files, which is kind of what Apple sends you there for,

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
on their Dot Mac servers, and we need this functionality back.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now, I've traced it down to, let me see, in the error message,

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
so here's what I did.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just to look at two different ones, two different head requests.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
One on the Dawn and Drew show, and it comes back with a 200 okay,

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and then it gives me the length of the file, and then it tells me when it's last,

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
when it's last been modified, then there's this e-tag thing, which is pretty cool.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I've been learning about that.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's basically a unique tag for that file, so you'll always know that that's that file.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And then just gives you some final data information.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now, when I did it on the daily source code on the Dot Mac hosting,

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I got the 4 or 3 invalid method, transfer encoding chunk,

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and here it is.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It says via 1.1 NetCash10, which is from NetCashNetApp.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So I'm thinking that this NetCash is something new, or maybe they've upgraded their systems.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They're clearly Apple is one of their customers, so I guess that they are doing some part of work in the,

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
in the Dot Mac network, and I think that's what's screwing it up.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I've got, since I posted this on the weblog,

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've heard a couple people say, you know, they were going to reach out to some friends they had,

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
who, quote, friends they had, who worked either at NetCash or in the Dot Mac architecture.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's see if we can get this fixed, because otherwise I have to find a solution tomorrow.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You know, that's it.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm off dot Mac, and I can't recommend any podcasts or go there.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I just have a hard time thinking that Apple really wants that.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So shout out to the engineers, the users are in peril.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We need your help.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This will motivate y'all.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But oh, mash up everybody.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's called Prince Jet.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's here on the Daily Source Code for Friday.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You'll get it.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Not just Prince.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But jet.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mash up.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's constant.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Got a love it.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, I said, are you going to be my mother back then?

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, yeah.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Not safe the work.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, I said, are you going to be my mother back then?

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
One, two, three.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tim, man.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come with me because you look so fine.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I really want to make it work.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, I said, are you going to be my mother back then?

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Come with me.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I said, are you going to be my mother back then?

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Come on, stand up, please

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I like you, I like you

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
One, two, three, tell my hand to come with me

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because you look so fine, I don't really want to make you watch

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's do fine, that really won't make you watch

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You're a vassist, you're my only get you kicked

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't need a money, when you look at that dirty honey

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I said, are you gonna be mine?

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I said, are you gonna be my girl?

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I said, are you gonna be mine?

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You don't need a money, when you look at that dirty honey

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I said, you gonna be mine?

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000

Those guys got it together, yesterday's flight was chock-full. It was really filled up to the hill

146
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,960
You know three three chairs on three seats on each side of the aisle

147
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,760
But everyone's still so nice and courtyous. You know, I was like, hey, we're all on this goddamn bus together

148
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,160
No one's got any rank over any we all, you know, try to get the cheapest fare by booking as far in advance as possible

149
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,600
And yeah, I'll move my shit over so yours can fit in. Yeah, I'll move so I saw you two can sit together

150
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
Yeah, of course you can share my newspaper

151
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,760
It's a great great culture and I wonder what it's like on longer trips

152
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't know if I can handle anything over an hour is a bit much for me

153
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,300
I've been a big you know really it would be great if podcasts. There's had some kind of like

154
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,200
Store that came with your podcast that you could just point to an object

155
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,020
That you talk about or that you're passionate about and then people could buy it through you that could be a CD or in my case

156
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
It could be the Senseo coffee machine

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
email which of course is available on

158
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,000
In the show notes that curry dot com or daily source code dot com from York steager from Germany says

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
Adam you've done such a nice dot promoting the Philips Senseo coffee machine

160
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,400
I actually bought myself one today and was completely blown away by the great taste of my first cup of Senseo coffee

161
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,040
Well, of course you are it's great. It's another fabulous invention of our of our time

162
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Just one question. What kind of flavor do you prefer?

163
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,280
Not quite sure which one to take. I took the regular red pads with me

164
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,960
I think there should be red pods. I think they take coffee pods red pads as a whole known the thing

165
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,280
Are there any better ones? I know I've tried the green of tried the brown and the red and I like them all it's just different flavors the whole the whole thing is

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,960
Senseo is just it's you can actually by the way

167
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,760
You don't only have to make coffee with the Senseo, you know you can also

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Put something else in between where the where the pad goes and make your own little pad and

169
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Well, you know fill it up with maybe some other type of leaves

170
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,440
I've tried that it does work it compresses it right through and gives you a a wonderful brimming cup of

171
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,160
Foul tasting but good feeling stuff

172
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,040
Great great invention Senseo a fine Dutch invention. I really I think it's a Dutch invention and I was from Philips

173
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,920
So you'd have to expect that it is pretty much touched so wouldn't be great if I could say you know if I said

174
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,480
I was I'd talk about the Senseo and then I could put up a picture and point to it and if you want to buy one

175
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,640
You'd buy it through me and I'd get like three three bucks or something. I'll be cool

176
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,880
I don't think we're far off from people stringing that kind of stuff together by the way that kind of you know it's so that's kind of like

177
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, it's kind of just kind of like like eBay

178
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:48,560
eBay Amazon you know both big places big infrastructure where they basically help you create something sell something and then hook you up with

179
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,040
With the readers in the viewers so I'm recommendations it's

180
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,960
The more things look the same the more they make the sense. Hey out on this is the sense. Say oh

181
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,200
That press from the stay on podcast. Oh my gosh. You may remember us from the Devon Wander

182
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:13,920
Sensing tour urban street last month from our trip to New Orleans and now we're podcasting live from our kitchen

183
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
On the little dog booty

184
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,040
But this isn't your average kicking podcast

185
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,440
Yeah, I'm playing a little music and we're just talking about our day

186
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,440
And I guess Cody wants to get his piece into

187
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,680
So anyway, we thought we'd let you know where we're at come check us out at say y'am dot blog spot dot com

188
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
And give us a listen

189
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Your appetite is about to say

190
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah, baby

191
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,520
I've I've been adding these types of things this sounds seeing tours dot com podcast feed

192
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,160
And if you if you're new subscriber to it, hopefully you'll be using one of the newer iPoders that give you the chance to just

193
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,040
Download the most recent because it's probably about 15 in there now. I haven't quite figured out what I should do with that

194
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,680
I just leave them all in one big RSS feed

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,760
I should certainly want to leave them all in the same place, but you know

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,640
I guess so I'll just leave it the way it is for now and I keep adding stuff as they come along

197
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,080
So sound sing tours dot com subscribe to the the podcast and I've subscribed to say y'am

198
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,120
So I'll listen to that if it's something for sound seeing because it sounds like it

199
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,800
I mean there's nothing wrong about sound seeing in your kitchen certainly not if you're cooking

200
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,160
Maybe we should put it in the cooking category on ipodder dot org

201
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,120
Which of course is still a the a great resource feed to go and check out new podcast every single day this new

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Submissions and additions

203
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
In the continuing quest for

204
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
Great ways to record your podcast. We've highlighted

205
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
mixed cast live

206
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
here on the show which

207
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,720
People are emailing me that they're using it with the quite a large degree of success that really enjoying that

208
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,840
And I also got an email from Frank and this is something you'll have to check the show notes for to

209
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,040
To read through it and and and get the instructions and also to get through the right URLs

210
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,680
But if you know what win-amp is win-amp is is a player that is used

211
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,160
predominantly of course on the PC and it's just I think just but everybody probably has a copy of it somewhere or is used

212
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,640
It's a very very popular because of its skin and bull

213
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,840
Look you can make win-amp look at any way you want there apparently there's a trick

214
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
in preferences you can

215
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,760
Allow win-amp to run multiple instances so there's you can run the program more than once and what Frank has done is he's figured out a way

216
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,680
To set it up in a with like a three-way mixer

217
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,440
So that you can actually have different win-amp players and which is cool of course you they can you know have your favorite skin on them so you could have them look

218
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah, just the way you want your studio to look

219
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,840
But you can use those in conjunction together, so I want to do

220
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,480
Like your microphone with effects one will do and they can all do effects separately

221
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,520
You want to do the music the sweepers and jingles if that's what you want

222
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,640
And what else and also you can use the line-in plug-in

223
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Win-amp is just so incredibly rich feature rich with with plug-ins and stuff that

224
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,120
This is well worth looking at it. Maybe a great solution for some of you

225
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,840
Who are just looking at a audio hijack pro and saying wow, so jealous

226
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,280
I don't have a Mac now I got to say this win-amp stuff with multiple instances look really really good

227
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,040
That's yeah, it's it's good stuff. Appreciate the

228
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,800
The pointer Frank also I've been receiving lots of pointers to

229
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,880
Glossaries we've been talking about sweepers bumpers jingles if you want to know what all those words mean or at least what they mean in the radio business

230
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I've put a link to radio glossary

231
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,080
On on the show notes for today as well. Let's see why don't we just grab a

232
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,520
Let's see whatever I do this when I bring up fire fox while I'm recording. It's kind of tricky so hold on

233
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Let's just read one or two of these

234
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Glossary entries hold on

235
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,480
Okay, so let's see if we start skipping yeah worked out now. Let's go to

236
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Firefarks okay

237
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,960
It's actually yeah, oh, this is a link from about dot com. Well, that's kind of cool

238
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
Let's see

239
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,800
Okay, it's taking forever to load that of course is because my

240
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,080
Poor little mac is sitting here saying oh you want me to record audio and get something from the web

241
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,560
All right, so let's take uh, oh this good ones here account executive

242
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,560
What is an account executive in the radio glossary?

243
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,880
Let's see a salesperson who sells commercials and services clients

244
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
Bend over client. I'm about to service you

245
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,320
I was actually looking for something more like bumper or sweeper hold on

246
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,880
Be back selling back time bumper. Here we go bumper bumper. What does what did say about bumper?

247
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
Of course, this is all open to interpretation

248
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:14,080
a pre-recorded audio element consisting of voice over music that acts as a transition to or from a stop set commercials and or other content

249
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Well, then this would be a promo I guess

250
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Oh

251
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,600
Hi podcasters my name is Michael Ryan and I'm podcasters from Ireland with my podcast airport EIRPOD

252
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,040
I can be found at airpod.com. That's EIRPOD.com all the details contact are there

253
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,600
So what is all about well, it's me my thing off usually why should I button have all the fun?

254
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,760
So please drop by and just leave you with this thought one of it's been Irish

255
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,040
When the rest of the world has serious problems out of hospital when the Irish have an hospital problem

256
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,640
It's not serious

257
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,160
That's a good point. Why should bono have all the fun and what the fuck is up with bono anyway?

258
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,240
Now I see him everywhere. I see him at every world economic forum at Davos

259
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
Switzerland. I see him with world leaders

260
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,000
You know with the same old tired leather jacket and the wrap round black sunglasses and

261
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,160
You know, but I never really see him in these countries he's talking about that's you know Bob Geldoff definitely

262
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,680
wins when it to me in my view when it comes to really you know hands on feet on the street getting shit done

263
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm a little tired of by Mikey can't really be tired of anyone who's trying to help the world but

264
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,640
You know do something radical

265
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,440
Surprise me, you know, it's like the whole rock star with politicians thing is just tired of seeing it, you know

266
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
It's not impressing anymore. That's not impressive. I should say

267
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,520
I don't know maybe that's just me and by the way bono there's lots of shit going on in Ireland right now

268
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
You may want to pay attention to as well

269
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,120
The beef is the two's this love shack

345
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
What a party song that is

346
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Yeah

347
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,080
All right, the beat 52's well, that's it for today. PW want to say something before you wrap things up

348
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,640
I just want to say thank you to Adam for being so supportive of both of our podcast

349
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,560
Okay, thanks Adam. See you next time for another edition of the hit test. Bye bye

350
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720

351
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,040
That's cool. PW Phantom and young poet both doing the hit test and me sucking as usual. Oh, guys. Thank you very much

352
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,240
I was gonna say that yesterday and I listened to better than shows. I was saying on the plane

353
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,880
And I didn't like it. It was too much the trivia Thursday is just not gonna work for me

354
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
although I really love each individual

355
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,040
Trivia question and you know that the Beatles baseline was just I mean it was phenomenal

356
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,800
You know what's gonna you just you get this trivia overkill is like watching electric back

357
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,680
You know for 15 hours straight is like listening to the the Thursday trivia podcast for me at least

358
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,000
And I also did get some feedback about that not everyone loved it that much to be quiet on this

359
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,400
And I think that you know if we if we can keep this one hit test

360
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,640
During the show in there. I think that's you know, that's more than enough and young again if you if you feel like you can't do one

361
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Don't worry about it. Okay. I've been known to skip a show once and a while myself also

362
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,400
I have a solution for all those wonderful trivia podcasts

363
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,560
Adam this is Rashad Kumar from Calo Hold on Rashad let me turn you up a second you're really soft

364
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,400
I hate it when that happens because the first thing everyone says is

365
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,280
Yeah, I can't hear it's too soft because try to shut now. Here we go

366
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,400
In case you wonder who I am sounds so young it's because I'm only 13 okay anyways

367
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,480
I've been liking the hit test a lot and I wanted your input if I were to syndicate all of the hit tests on a podcast

368
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,640
People will send them to give me hit tests at gmail.com. That's

369
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,960
g i v e m e h i t t

370
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,200
e s t s

371
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,600
at gmail.com and then I will put them into an RSS feed for other podcasts just to use in their podcasts

372
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,800
Anyways, please tell me whether this is a good idea or not good day. Well first of all

373
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,800
The fact that you you sit the what you just said to me just blew me away. You know, so he's a 13 year old

374
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,160
Saying hey, I'll just syndicate this up with them in my own podcast feed no problems or other podcasts

375
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,000
Can use like I'm totally liking this. I think it's a great idea

376
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,520
So you got the email address there

377
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
Give me hit test at gmail.com

378
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,720
If you have those hit that send them to to Rashad and I will be more than happy

379
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,480
To promote the the feed in fact me we may even want to start a category of trivia in

380
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,520
In the ipar.org directory. So yeah fantastic idea because I know

381
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,720
What's happening now is people are sending me all these great trivia

382
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,560
Questions and trivia tests that I just I really just can't do much with it because I don't have enough hours in my own children

383
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Do anything with it

384
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,840
Did my shock you and Midland Texas where I grew up the town did not teach children

385
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,040
And frankly George W. Bush and I read a simple children's book

386
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
So tonight the question comes

387
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,360
Is there hope for me? Do I have a chance?

388
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
My fellow Americans

389
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
I am prepared to learn

390
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Joridae simple children's book and

391
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,480
President George W. Bush will keep that promise no changes no way

392
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
God bless America

393
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,040
Hey, do you think that was editing?

394
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320

I wouldn't have made it just perfect. That's it for this Friday, this was the source code.

459
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Both my girls are down and out with the flu, so I'm gonna let this compress get it ready to shoot up to the server.

460
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,880
I have to send it to two servers today that gosh, I don't know. Hopefully we'll be able to download this one way or the other.

461
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
But I gotta go do some grocery shopping, y'all.

462
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,880
This weekend, I wanted to do a show with Patricia. She just may not be up to it. She sounds horrible, blocked up, so maybe I'll call Ken.

463
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,880
