1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You got me?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is it working?

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Everybody hear me okay?

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wow.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What an interesting couple of days it's been.

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's been just phenomenal.

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was thinking, well, what can I do?

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You know, keynote usually.

14
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I thought keynote's were supposed to be at the beginning of something, but now in

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
hindsight I'm like, wow, this is pretty interesting to have this tremendous opportunity

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to speak with you at the end of a conference.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And I was in my hotel room yesterday or the actually the evening before recording a daily source

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
code.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And I realized that it was episode 199.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I thought to myself, wouldn't it be a cool idea to do a source code with you

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
at being essentially, oh man, I should talk to Steve Jobs about that.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's actually number 200.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I have multiple computers set up, set up.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If anyone was ever listened to the daily source code, this is the crapplet, so let's hope

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that it stays intact for today.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So if you don't mind, I'd like to do a source code with you.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is that okay?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Delta share a charlie, two zero zero, something remarkable is happening here.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
radio is invented.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
60 million dollars worth of airplane strap to my ass.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the next generation radio content in my ears.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I like to think I'm shining into the future.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I guess it is.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm curious.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, hey everybody, welcome to the daily source code for June 25, 2005.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I got to tell you, I really have a lot of thought going to the source code for today.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And the first thing that freaked me out was, Chris saying that you have an hour and a half to talk.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was like an hour and a half.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't do more than 40 minutes.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's the set amount of time that I have in me.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Obviously, that's very relevant to this particular spot where we are, this area of Seattle.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because 40 minutes marker actually came to life.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I noticed that day liner would not hear certain things in the daily source code.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He'd say, well, I didn't hear that bit.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm like, well, why didn't you hear that?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, my walk was over.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He would walk around this area right there.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And this walk was 40 minutes.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I said, well, shoot.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll keep it to 40 minutes so you can hear everything I said.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How are you?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How are you?

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My goodness.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We have learned so many exciting things here.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We've seen so many interesting damn announcements.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The web feed, the streaming feed, has been just amazing.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We've been able to sit in your hotel room and listen to the part of it.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Be a part of the conference.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And it still had very much an uncomfortable feel to it.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Which, of course, is a term that was coined for BlahverCon.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And the feeling and the vibe has been good.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What I like about the unconference is kind of the tradition of starting off with a song we all sing together

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and Dave, of course, let us with a yellow submarine at the beginning of the conference.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I felt that maybe we should start a new tradition and we'll do a mashup at the end of the conference.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So this is the four minutes for you to do an aggregator stand.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you want to check your mail for a second.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And if you want a band, that's okay too.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sergeant peppers paradise.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Jimmy James.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
On the source code.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ryan, sin, sin grab the handcha.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He'll be called you a moment in charge of the song.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Trust me.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sergeant peppers paradise.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Drunk.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
man.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He gave up her door.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you guys believe only our names.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can newborn to the home.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Call me a moment in charge on your shirt.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's such an endless life in my soul now

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is how you know they gotta go, they gotta go, they gotta go, they gotta go, they gotta go, they gotta go, they gotta go

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Woo!

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's one thing to do today

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's such an endless life in my life

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's one thing to do today

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's such an endless life in my life

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's one thing to do today

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's one thing to do today

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's one thing to do today

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's such an endless life in my life

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's such an endless life in my life

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's one thing to do today

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's such an endless life in my life

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's again

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Clearly also nice photo opportunity to come here

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's such an endless life in my life

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's such an endless life in my life

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
It's such a wonderful feeling, it's a wonderful feeling

105
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:42,500
If I live in the evening, I'll only return to you

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a boy and I'll make it round

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's see if I can sing a song

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
Let me put you on the scene round

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I live in the evening, I'll only return to you

110
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't do anything, don't do anything, don't do anything

111
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,000
I live in the evening, I'll only return to you

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't do anything, don't do anything, don't do anything

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Alright, well, I prepared it, I forgot

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I could go on for a day and listen with stuff like that

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's just fantastic match

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Jimmy James, Sergeant Pepper's paradise, the extended edition

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's here for a scobel, for getting everything going there

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We'll go on that, we'll go on that, we'll go on that, we'll go on that

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fantastic

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In 1969, some of the brightest and most creative musicians got together for their own benefit.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And in the process, it actually changed the world. Some of you in this room were there.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who else was at Woodstock? Come on. You know, still, see, go more as there.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Dave won't you there? Yeah. In fact, I think I wrote a post that Dave wrote a couple of weeks ago.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They said it felt like this was going to be like Woodstock.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And here we are, 20 years ago today.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Excuse me, it is like Woodstock. It is like Woodstock.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Almost 25 years later.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That is a question.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes, I think it is the brown Wi-Fi that you got to be careful of.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So really, we have several hundred of the most talented creative brilliant minds here,

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
jamming together with new instruments.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And this time, the world is listening instead of a couple million. That is a really big deal.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And if you have had a chance to look at the output of this conference, it is just astounding.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know, there is thousands of blog posts that are showing up on techno-radi.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Flickr is just overflowing with pictures. Look at yourselves, Christfake.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Look at it. Look at what we have got. Still cameras, video cameras, microphones.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is just phenomenal. We are the media. It is astounding to me.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The real question is, what message should we be sending to the world from nomads?

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think that message is we want to take back our media.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Not to put it into our hands to hold it, but to put it back into our hearts.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Here is what I have learned so far in the past couple days.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The internet is obviously very powerful.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Powerful as a communications medium, also as a marketing medium.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And we have heard a lot of different opinions and viewpoints on that in the past couple days.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And no matter how hard we try, it is never going to be one or the other.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It is always going to be both.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, I suggest we just admit that and start embracing it.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It is kind of our version of free love.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because free love is communications.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It is free speech.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Free love is for users.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It is for developers.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It is for lawyers, politicians, big companies, small companies.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Free love is for the people.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And we need to be continuously enabling that.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And we need to bring in our audience.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That is what I mean when I am talking about the 100 million listener mark.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We have to let people know that it is happening.

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And we are getting very close.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
People are starting to catch on to it.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, what is it we have been called here, not the early adopters, but what was the term?

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Exactly.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But in order to make this happen, we do need some fuel.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Microsoft, we need some fuel from you.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Apple, we need fuel.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Real, we need fuel, audible, we need fuel.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And we are going to help you sell iPods and music and operating systems.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But please keep listening because we are telling you what we want.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And we need to get some stuff done.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How are we going to get this done?

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How are we going to get big companies to work with us?

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How are we really going to get this flowing?

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yesterday on the Gilmour Gang, which I thought was a great episode, by the way.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I really enjoyed doing that.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I drew the analogy between the meeting that day one and I had in 2000,

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that spurred days creation of the enclosure tag in RSS 2.0.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I compared that to the, I think it was a television commercial,

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
or one person is walking on the street with a candy bar.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The other is walking on the street with a jar of peanut butter.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
God knows why, look right in the commercial.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They bump into each other and they both have a taste and it's like,

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
oh, this is a really nice combination.

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And of course, that is what became RSS peanut butter cups.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't even know that's a real story, but I loved it as an ad.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So the result of that was four years of Dave and I,

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
basically, sending back huge media files, posting about it,

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
talking about it, he'd created the first aggregator that understood

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and closures.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So we had a great experience amongst the two of us,

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but I think after about four years, the peanut butter and

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
chocolate got a little old, and nothing really happened.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So perhaps a better analogy is what happened in 2004,

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't take the analogy to the movie big with Tom Hanks.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I wouldn't see that movie.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Dave can be Tom Hanks for this particular example.

196
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The magic really happened when we switched places.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When I, as a user, became a developer,

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and Dave was a developer became a user.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And how did that happen?

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't exactly remember the month, but it wasn't 2004,

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and I was receiving new content from Dave.

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It wasn't the greatful dead and P3.

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It wasn't the quick time movie trailer.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It was something new.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It was interviews.

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The Christopher Liden was doing.

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And how this is like, wow, here's a guy who knows how to interview

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
people.

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And this is something that's being distributed through this new distribution

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
mechanism and it's showing up automatically.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And I was delighted.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What was even better I'd have to say is when Dave became so frustrated

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that happens once in a while.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It became so frustrated with, well, I can't speak on his behalf,

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
but I think with just radio and traditional media

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that he wanted to make it himself.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I know that he...

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, no, no, no, no.

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, no, no, no.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, I wanted to get to a different point about that.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No, no, no, it's going.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, no.

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you're going to get it, but you've got it.

224
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Make sure Steve was told that he was.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Steve Gilmore was an inspiration to you doing that, Ben.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Correct.

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The result was very interesting to me.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The result was, and I'm a professional broadcaster,

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the result was these programs or shows or audio blog posts,

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
whatever the hell you want to call them, these files that would come down

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to my desktop automatically that had Dave recording.

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And it was fantastic.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It was completely everything was breaking microphones falling.

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The recording was on when it should be off.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It was off when it should have been on.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And I loved it.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was like, my God, this is fantastic stuff.

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is so fucked up.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's great.

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I love it.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I need more of this.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was totally totally enjoying it.

243
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But I had my own frustrations, because at the time I had about a 45 to an hour

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
long commute in the morning.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And so the radio user land aggregated would bring down the MP3 files

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and put them on my desktop.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And every morning I'd have to go into the folder, find the file,

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
drag it over iTunes, iTunes, and had to synchronize with my iPod.

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I became tedious.

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It doesn't seem like a big deal.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But there were days where I said, I don't have any time.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I mean, I don't have time to go through that sequence.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But yeah, it just takes time.

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And I was frustrated.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I think it was blocked the first second blogger kind of thing.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And we were in Boston.

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And I'd asked developers, just I'm sure, as Dave, and I know he did, had asked

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
other people, how do I record?

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What kind of microphone should I use?

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And he probably didn't even get any good input or feedback from me on that,

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
or anyone really.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So he took a whole bunch of time to figure out how to do it.

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And by trial and error found a recording program that would work for him,

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and a microphone that would work for him.

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And so I started to do the same, because I couldn't get anyone to create that

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
little, really that little piece in the middle.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I said, it seems to me, like, and this is me talking to developers.

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It seems to me like we should be able to create something that

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
looks at an RSS 2.0 feed with enclosures.

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Identifies as a new enclosure.

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Downloads it and puts it on my iPod.

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And every single developer I talk to said, yeah, absolutely real easy.

274
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll do it for you tomorrow.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, that's the same thing as me saying, yeah, Dave, I'll hook it with the mic tomorrow,

276
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
because of course it never happened.

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So out of my own frustration, I built that piece that made life easier for me.

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And that is, of course, users and developers partying together.

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's really what happened in my mind to make this podcasting to take off.

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So we finally reached a point where we were able to swap roles.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And really, we stepped into a different dimension.

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It was really unbelievable.

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We swap roles.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We can do that now.

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We're able to communicate our experiences very quickly and efficiently with each other,

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
which gives us incredible power.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I'm sure that I'm not the only person in this room experiencing this.

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sure that there are developers here who are having user experiences,

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and learning a lot more about that, and users who are having developer experiences.

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And technology is really enabling that quite a bit.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So here's what I learned as a developer.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This shit is hard work.

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
God damn.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's unbelievable.

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And it's writing a language, except you can't flub it.

296
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And you can't say, oh, well, I'll drop a comma here or a colon there because with code writing,

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
no way, the interpreter says, not going to work.

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If you're writing for humans, it's a little more easier.

299
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Humans are, you know, we'll let that kind of pass through.

300
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And wow.

301
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's an art form.

302
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It is 100% art.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's so many decisions to be made.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So many different ways to approach a problem.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So many different ways to do something.

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was blown away.

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Really, learned so much.

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And I hope that there are developers who have learned a lot about users.

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I also learned that the really easy shit gets done last.

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And I think that's pretty critical.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So for me, it was very easy to say, please take that download

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
an MP3 file and put it on the iPod.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And because it was easy, I believe it was overlooked and it wasn't done.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And we talk about users and developers.

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They work at big companies, too.

316
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Some of you work for big companies are in this room.

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And people, big companies, make up the DNA of these big companies.

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They're just people.

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They're users.

320
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They're developers.

321
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just people.

322
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And big companies can be really helpful if guided correctly because they have the resources

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
to create any infrastructure needs that we have.

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And because of web logs and podcasts and people and users and developers

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
who are already together, we're actually getting some stuff that we want.

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Look at what happened here at this conference.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
RSS going to be built right into Windows.

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean, even they didn't think that would ever happen.

329
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think Tuesday or Wednesday, not even a year after the term podcasting was coined by Danny Grigwar,

330
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
podcasting support built right into iTunes.

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
To me, that's just phenomenal.

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But we really have to make sure we get even better signal to noise ratio in our conversations,

333
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and then we're really unstoppable.

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And we need to do this in order to enable the full power of subscription.

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Because that's really what I see going on here.

336
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This power of subscription.

337
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's really changing everything.

338
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The whole models are turned around.

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
By the way, it's the dream of mainstream media.

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
They've always wanted something by appointment.

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Radio by appointment.

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's why you hear on the radio today.

343
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey, tune in tomorrow.

344
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Don't go anywhere.

345
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll be right back.

346
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because we've got to bring them back in.

347
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Make sure that they tune in.

348
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Now all we have to say is, hey, stay subscribed.

349
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Very, very powerful stuff.

350
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So before we can really show the world where the parties act,

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
we need to, I think, fix a few things.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I think these are relatively simple.

353
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's get one click subscriptions working now.

354
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And just like the internet is going to be for marketing and communications,

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
there's going to be some formats that are crossover.

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So there's RSS, there's Adam.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There's MP3, there's WMA, there's AAC.

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I think we kind of all see the formats.

359
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I was very happy to hear the aggregators speak.

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm not quite sure who said it, but someone said,

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
we're Switzerland.

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Switzerland is neutral.

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Very expensive place to live, by the way, Switzerland is.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But if that's the commitment, the aggregator developers are making,

365
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
then Shapo Baha hats off to you because I think that you really hold the key to a lot of this stuff.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So you eat Adam feeds, you aren't eat RSS feeds.

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Can you eat the feed, colon slash, slash one subscription,

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
can you eat the Adam element subscription?

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think so.

370
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think we just need to say, okay, we have a couple multiple, several multiple formats.

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Let's just implement it all and move on.

372
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So we can just go because the users out there are audience,

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
people who want to listen, who want to watch, who want to read,

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and who also want to write and want to create audio and video.

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
They're ready for us, but we just have to fix a few of those things to help them along.

376
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Metadata, got some good work going on, some great namespaces for RSS,

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
media RSS is one, Microsoft lists, Apple is doing a namespace for podcasting for their iTunes.

378
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We really need to get working on attention.xml.

379
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you don't know what that is, check the show notes, they'll be a link to Steve Wilmore,

380
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
who will be very happy to explain that.

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's critical we get some of this stuff going.

382
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And also let's address the bandwidth issue now before it becomes a real problem.

383
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I had some time to think about what we discussed yesterday.

384
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I think it is time to make a corner turn on PTP, particularly for podcasting.

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So until something else comes along that we all agree makes sense,

386
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I fully intend to implement Bitcoin and support it, and I hope you all do too.

387
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And I have some ideas and I look forward to working with the aggregator developers and the podcast developers on making that work.

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Because I think we can do it, and if we all bond together, then we can really make some cool stuff happening.

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's going to be critical, because the experiences are going to start to be great, very, very quickly,

390
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
as listeners come in and we just don't have the bandwidth to serve them.

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Just pass the pay for the bandwidth to serve them, it's probably even worse.

392
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So these things I think are really simple with the group of people that I've seen here that I've met here,

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I've spoken to many of you, what I find fascinating is that I know everyone of you.

394
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We either corresponded through audio feedback or a project podcast or a regular weblog.

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And you know a lot about me too, it's kind of interesting.

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I asked him, you know, how's Patricia? How's your mom? How's the dog? How's the cat? How's the beautiful man? It's absolutely beautiful.

397
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think we'll see some amazing changes happen in the next six months.

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm comfortable with even predicting something like that.

399
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The music industry is I think part of the media that we're about ready to take back into our hearts very quickly.

400
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And here's why. First of all, the tools for the so-called professionals absolutely know different from the tools they so-called amateur's use.

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're using pro tools, you're using audition, you're using garage branch, and the jagger uses garage man.

402
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So there can be no difference with the output.

403
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
If you're talented, you're going to have the same quality as someone who, like a big jagger.

404
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Only you don't have the same type of push out into the world.

405
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's not the distribution, by the way, because we've had distribution for a long time.

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,000
People are creating their music, their artwork, and they're putting up on MP3s, putting up on sites like garageband.com or MP3tunes.com.

407
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We also have the sales mechanism already in place. My God, we've got another piece that's already there.

408
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
CD Baby, iTunes, I think, has like 11,000 pod save music tracks.

409
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They don't call it pod safe, but we do.

410
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So that's there. What are we missing?

411
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What is the key link in the chain that we've been missing?

412
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, if you look at the music industry as the way it is today, there's the awesome power of promotion through radio.

413
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Although that is also kind of diminished a little bit.

414
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Radio is really sunk into packaging and marketing and playlists.

415
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You know, because they have very defined set of time in traditional broadcast media.

416
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But when is the last time you heard a disjockey?

417
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Excuse me, Sensei O.

418
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
When is the last time you heard a disjockey go, I love this band.

419
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm going to play this fucking record every single day until you love them too and go to other concerts and buy their t-shirts.

420
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You don't hear that anymore.

421
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You hear?

422
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Five, thirty-five, everybody how you're doing is zero and all the other.

423
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So an amazing thing happened last year when I stumbled across some music from a band from New York,

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
four girls who've studied a Juleard and they're called the Lissivia's Bitties.

425
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And I love their music.

426
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Certainly not something mainstream that would make it onto Jack FM or whatever the formats are.

427
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And it was nice about it.

428
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I just sent him an email.

429
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I said, hey, can I play one of your songs on my podcast?

430
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, sure.

431
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We own the rights to that.

432
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's ours.

433
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You know, we've created it.

434
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Go ahead.

435
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We'd love for you to play something.

436
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
An amazing thing happened.

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
After I played it, I got an email from Leon Westover, the singer for the band.

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
She says, Adam, we sold like 200 CDs in one day.

439
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And when you're selling CDs at 10 bucks a pop,

440
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you're putting 90% of the profit into your pocket,

441
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
that becomes rent money.

442
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That becomes pretty significant.

443
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Now they're on a 10 day tour.

444
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You know, they're selling out 5,600 room, a seat rooms.

445
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's fantastic.

446
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Just,

447
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think it was last week.

448
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I stumbled across another song,

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
a guy named Rob Costlow.

450
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He's in Los Angeles.

451
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And when it comes to picking hits,

452
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
this is something really big in the radio industry.

453
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You know, you had these music directors and, you know,

454
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
they award winning, billboard award winning,

455
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
music director because they know how to pick the hits.

456
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
When really, it's just repetition.

457
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You know, if you have a song that has what they call a hook,

458
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
a catchy hook,

459
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
if you repeat it over and over and over again,

460
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you're eventually going to learn that hook.

461
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You're going to learn that song.

462
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're going to sing it.

463
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're going to recognize it.

464
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You might even start to like it.

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
In fact, I think you probably will start to like it.

466
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's why your commercial jingles work well.

467
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If they're repeated continuously.

468
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So, Rice, Rooney,

469
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
the San Francisco treat,

470
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
we all know that one.

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I'd like to teach the world to sing,

472
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
who knows that.

473
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's Coca-Cola song.

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So, you go to your iPod and say,

475
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
can't wait to put the Rice Rooney song on my iPod?

476
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
No, you know.

477
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But you know it because of the repetition.

478
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I think that's a waste of time, really,

479
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
to get someone to know something.

480
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What's much more effective,

481
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but what's happening now, is podcasts.

482
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There's our listening to each other.

483
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, when I played, actually, I'll play a little bit of it,

484
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
because it's a really beautiful song.

485
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
When I played this particular track,

486
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I got emails from all over the world from people saying,

487
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I want to play that song on my podcast.

488
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I loved it.

489
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Rob Costa sent me an email yesterday.

490
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He's been booked now in thousands-seat room gigs.

491
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
He's been asked to do movie scores.

492
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's just phenomenal what is happening.

493
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And why?

494
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Just because we're passing off this information,

495
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
we're passionate about what it is,

496
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and we're sending people straight over to the creator of the music,

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and he's able to sell it and promote his music online.

498
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This is for a couple of seconds.

499
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Here's really beautiful.

500
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

501
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thank you.

502
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Isn't that pretty?

503
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yes, absolutely beautiful.

504
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So, here's just a guy with a keyboard,

505
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
recording on whatever tools that came pre-packaged with his PC.

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I knew you know if he used a Mac or PC,

507
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and we're able to share that.

508
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We're able to actually generate

509
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
revenue for him.

510
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Attention for him.

511
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He's able to go out of the world and continue with his art.

512
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think that's extremely powerful.

513
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Sorry, Rob.

514
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm going to stop there.

515
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So, I think our message to the world,

516
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
what I would hope,

517
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
is that we are taking back our media,

518
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
taking it back to its roots,

519
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
where it belongs,

520
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
in the hearts and the minds of the people,

521
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and we're doing that to the power of subscription.

522
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So, I'm going to let you off really early,

523
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
because my podcast is only supposed to be 40 minutes.

524
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We're just about there.

525
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I do want to thank some people personally

526
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
for making not only this conference possible,

527
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
but for what is happening,

528
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
we are truly, truly seeing something very special

529
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that's happening,

530
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and make sure you get your message out.

531
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Everyone's got their tools with them,

532
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
to make sure you prepare the people that listen

533
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
or read or watch whatever you're doing,

534
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that it's coming,

535
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and that they can participate,

536
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and they are absolutely welcome.

537
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So, first of all,

538
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'd like to thank all the developers

539
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
for all the work that they've been doing.

540
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'd like you to give me a big hand.

541
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'd like to thank Dave Winner for his work on RSS,

542
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
OPML, weblogs, podcasting.

543
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We don't always agree on everything,

544
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
but I respect you,

545
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and I do love you.

546
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They've won it.

547
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Thank you.

548
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Robert Scoville,

549
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
we're all your Robert.

550
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Stand up for a second.

551
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Not only should you be running Microsoft,

552
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
you actually already do.

553
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And then finally, before I get out of here,

554
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Chris and Ponzi, ladies and gentlemen,

555
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
what a fantastic job they've done.

556
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Come on out.

557
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:10,000
All right, that's the Daily Source Code for today,

558
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
June 25th, 2005.

559
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We'll see you all on Next Source Code,

560
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and at the next NomeDex.

561
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Thank you very much.

562
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We'll see you all on Next Source Code,

563
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000

564
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and you all on Next Source Code,

567
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay we've done a lot of things for this week.

568
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,000
Bro what are you doing with this world?

569
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm just thinking,

570
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Right on.

571
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Right on.

572
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So anyway, again, we're actually wonderful.

573
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I have a glad and keep experience that ever 200.

574
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Number 200.

575
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah.

576
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Twenty-two hundred, whichever one is split over.

577
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Anyway, anything else?

578
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That's it.

579
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's it.

580
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Okay.

581
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
We're going to talk a lot under the name.

582
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I just said, just wrap up again.

583
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We're going to come up here and one of my long-side games, just tell me we're going

584
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
to have to relax for a little while and talk about what we're going to be.

585
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I'm going to say that.
