1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Delta, share a Charlie 2-4-Zero.

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,440
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped to my ass.

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Transmidders?

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,240
Than the next generation radio content in my ears.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,080
We don't need no sticking, can we?

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,440
I like to think I'm flying into the future.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,240
Welcome to the Curry Kondo. It's the 15th of September, 2005.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,120
Well, brand new acoustics, everybody.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,520
How you doing? Welcome to your daily source code.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,480
It's been a few days.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,320
If that all kinds of stuff going on,

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,080
why do you have explanation of your, uh,

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
you'll understand once we're getting to it?

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,520
The very first show coming to you from Curry Kondo.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,120
This is your daily source code.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,920
So, um, apologies first and foremost for those of you

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,080
bummed out that I actually haven't had more than one show up all this week.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,560
Because now Thursday, international,

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,800
jet-ro-sexual, man of mystery,

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,160
traveling all over the globe.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,560
That'll definitely screw up your, uh, your source code schedule.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Take that and some DNS and transfer and delivery

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
issues and all kinds of crap, but I'm here.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,480
It's been my first night at the Kondo.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,200
I've got lots to talk about about our adventures in New York.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,360
What's going to be happening for the next two weeks in San Francisco, California?

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,840
Okay, just to set the scene a little bit, um,

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,960
I'm in the Kondo.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,040
Uh, of course you have no idea what that looks like,

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,200
really maybe you seem wanted to picture it on a weblock,

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,360
but, um, I have a bed.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,640
I have a couch. I've got, uh, table. I have no chairs.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Uh, I have no cups.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,120
Uh, apparently, JC Penny did deliver a whole bunch of stuff,

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,120
but when I got here last night, after the plane ride, uh, from hell,

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,560
there was nothing here, so we're just kind of making

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
do with what we got. I still got to figure out where to get some breakfast.

38
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,200
Uh, yeah, it is 1045. Um, I'm going to break it down and, uh,

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,720
give you a full rundown of everything that's been going on. All good stuff.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,320
As, uh, we roll out a kind of, I don't want to do,

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,800
like a jazzy source go today, kind of just mellow and, uh, kind of ease into it.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,360
I found, um, from mashuptown.com, very interesting mashup.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,240
Titled, even your jazz is not safe from the mashup,

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,120
and it's, uh, a little bit of, uh, was it take five in there?

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,640
And, uh, well, you see if you can, uh, figure out all of the different jazz songs.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,840
Enjoy this while I, uh, get to put some on my feet.

47
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah, well, jazzy, uh, jazzy undertones to kick off the daily source code, uh, for this, uh, Thursday.

48
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,760
So you can hear right off the bat, there's a way different acoustics taken place here.

49
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm also in the, uh, uh, in the living room slash, um, well, there's an open kitchen.

50
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,560
It has, uh, oh, second. It has, uh, it has a bar, uh, and so I basically put everything next to

51
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,240
the sink. I've got, uh, got the power book here. I've got, uh, the digital audio workstation. I've got, uh,

52
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I got the new mic, uh, which I have, uh, there's a little flight case that comes with this new,

53
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,000
AKG mic, so I've actually stood that on its end. And I'm still leaning over, of course, so I don't have a podcast

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,680
complex up here, but I have different ideas for how I want to set stuff up here. Also, um, you could tell that, uh,

55
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:37,480
it's just empty. Uh, I've got the most phenomenal view here. Um, I can see if, now, I have, what is it, uh,

56
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,280
three, two hundred, two hundred, like two hundred, no, I don't have two hundred,

57
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,360
see, I have to go from there. Well, yeah, I almost have like a hundred and seventy degree view. I'm

58
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,480
almost a hundred-dated degree view. I guess it's depending on how you look at it. Uh, corner, um,

59
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,880
corner apartment that kind of hangs out over the building. So it's really cool. So I, to the right,

60
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,760
I see, uh, the skyline, the city, um, ahead. I see, uh, the hills. And if I were to look left, uh,

61
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,800
actually I'm right across from the Bank of America building, uh, and the clock's not working.

62
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,840
On the last night when I came in, it was working, and then at midnight it went off, and it hasn't

63
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,640
come back on yet. I wonder if it only, uh, if it's only on at night. And of course, there is the, uh,

64
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,800
the up ramp, the on ramp to the, uh, uh, was it, uh, to the Bay Bridge over to Oakland. So I've got

65
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,200
to really quite an, uh, an amazing view, although there is a huge yellow crane, almost, uh, almost at

66
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,560
my, I level here, and we're up on the 24th floor. Uh, and I don't know how long the construction

67
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,880
is going to go on, but, uh, let me see, where should we start? When we last, um, when we last spoke,

68
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,000
I was on my way to New York, that was Tuesday. Yeah, I was going to do a source code on Tuesday,

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,280
but then we had all kinds of DNS issues and all kinds of stuff, uh, basically just blew up,

70
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,280
and so I was able to repose Monday source code, uh, thanks to Apple putting it on the dot

71
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,520
Mac, and I may even have to do that again today, because we're still having all kinds of DNF

72
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,040
stuff, DNF stuff, but this is, you know, this is what happens. Uh, luckily we're all just kind of

73
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,000
getting back from somewhere vacation. So we're working all the kinks out and, uh, Brian and Marcus

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,440
and, uh, Chris Rockwell, we're all moving servers, uh, over the past two days they've been up for,

75
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,480
for just nights on end, get everything all set up because, you know, yeah, um, I love it when

76
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,720
people say, oh, you've got all that money. You're so well funded and you shit didn't work. Well,

77
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,040
that's exactly what we've got it for. So, you know, give us a little time to play catch up if you don't

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,880
would really work on it. Um, so I didn't do the show on Tuesday, even though I had a kind of plan,

79
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,640
so I have a few of the elements, uh, for Tuesday's show in today's show. Um, flew, uh,

80
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,120
of course, Virgin upper class loved it as always. It was funny. The, um, the entire crew from,

81
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,200
orange county chopper was that, um, a chopper is born. Is that, uh, no, that's not the tide

82
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,640
love it. Uh, maybe it's called orange county chopper. I don't remember the name of the reality

83
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,680
show where they build chopper motorcycles. It's, uh, basically, you know, the big dude with the, uh,

84
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,800
with the kind of like the walrus mustache, the whitish walrus mustache. So he and his, uh, I guess

85
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,680
four, five of them were all, uh, uh, on my flight. And it was pretty funny because he and, I guess

86
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,760
it was his girlfriend or maybe his wife, I don't know. Um, uh, so they had two of the middle seats.

87
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,000
Now, these are like the, the sweet seats that they have. So you know, we've discussed this where

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,920
you've kind of got your own little world there. And there's a divider if you're in one of the

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
middle seats, uh, one of the middle two, um, there's a divider right down the middle of the

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,720
plane, so that, you know, your seat mate basically, you know, doesn't bother you. It was so funny

91
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,000
because, you know, it was clear that, um, he wanted, uh, I should figure out what his name is.

92
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Uh, he, he clearly wanted to be kind of closer to his wife. And so out came the screw drivers and

93
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,520
they just dismantled the whole thing, the whole divider in between these two seats and basically

94
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,880
created a huge double bed, which was hilarious because I'm like, yeah, next time I travel with the

95
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,920
Trish, I'm going to do that. He's got to bring my, uh, um, my compass and rubber knife and we'll

96
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,040
get it all all fixed up. Um, the flight was, uh, reasonably uneventful, although we did have, uh,

97
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I'd have to say about four, 500 miles worth of clean air turbulence, um, which isn't, you know,

98
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,200
dangerous per se. Uh, usually nothing really happens. And, you know, the airplane is,

99
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,480
can well withstand, uh, the shocks and jolt, but it's very uncomfortable, uh, for, uh, for the

100
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,760
passengers, um, and it was kind of hard to get to sleep. And I actually, it gave me a little bit of a pain in my neck,

101
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,880
just because of all the, the bouncing and jolting must have gone on for, uh, um, yeah,

102
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,080
probably about an hour, 45 minutes to an hour. Um, and then I got into New York, um, and the United

103
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:48,280
Nations, uh, as you probably know, uh, or mate might have heard, have their 60th, uh, general assembly,

104
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,760
this week in New York. There was not a sin, and of course, a fashion week just ended. There was not a single

105
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:02,280
hotel in the entire city that had one single room, not even at the airport. And I'd foolishly

106
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:09,000
booked myself into, uh, into Newark airport. And the hotel we wound up getting was, uh, up, uh, in Westchester,

107
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:17,160
like near Rye, New York. Uh, so I had a fun time, like two hours from the airport getting up there,

108
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,960
because it was nine, nine, nine, 30 at night. And for some reason, of course, the George W. The

109
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,480
George Washington Bridge was completely backed up. It was, it was a nightmarish. And, you know,

110
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,520
so got in and we had to leave the hotel at 7 a.m. the next morning to go in and, and present. And we,

111
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:41,560
and we did two, uh, two presentations, uh, to two groups of media buyers, um, and media planners,

112
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,600
uh, so these are the people that actually buy radio advertising and, uh, internet advertising. And

113
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,680
I think we did two sessions and we had about 50 people in each one, I'd say, very, very enthusiastic.

114
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Lots of really good questions and some, and nice to see some very creative thinking going on about

115
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,040
how we can do, um, different types of advertising, uh, in podcasts. So, uh, that was, uh,

116
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,880
I was actually quite delightful. And then, um, so that was, of course, Wednesday, and, you know,

117
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,240
I had no time to do a show, um, and at quarter to three, the car picked this up and my, like,

118
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,360
was a 23rd street or something like that. To go to JFK, took us two hours to get the JFK,

119
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,800
the flight, which, of course, was fully booked. So, there was, uh, Chris, who's our, uh, VP of business

120
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,760
development, and we were both together. So, we were sitting in the back, like, row, uh, 39,

121
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,520
or something like that, because there was, you know, no other seats available, no upgrades available,

122
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,480
or anything. Uh, and then we sat on the tarmac for about two hours, and then, of course,

123
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,680
the six and a half hour flight. So, by the time I got in, it was, uh, it was a court like a 1230

124
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,880
quarter to one, and we had literally been on the road for 12 hours, and so I was just completely wiped

125
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,920
out, and I basically threw the sheet on the bed that Patricia had, had nicely packed into my, uh,

126
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,600
into my suitcase, and, uh, and hit the hay, and I must say, I had a great sleep, uh, I didn't

127
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:09,240
wake up for anything, really, uh, just kind of awoke all by myself, uh, to, uh, well, unfortunately,

128
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:16,280
it's kind of a gray foggy day, um, foggy day. I can see, uh, when I can see the other side of the day,

129
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,520
so it's not all that bad, but the hills are still, um, uh, the crests are just, uh, enveloped

130
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,120
in fog, is that what I, is that, what it is, and enveloped? Uh, that's fog, okay? It's just a fricking.

131
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,880
You don't want to fly there. Let's put it, not without your instrument rating. Let's put it that way.

132
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,040
Also, it's something that I had to queue up for Tuesday, from the across the sound podcast,

133
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,200
was, uh, a topic that we discussed, uh, with all these, uh, media buyers and planners and advertising

134
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,400
agency people, and they had actually discussed some of the sound advertising stuff that I had done

135
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,080
on their show, and I just wanted to play a little snippet from that for you. I think that's interesting,

136
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,640
actually, what's, what's, have you heard about what Adam Curry is doing? He's got a neat experiment.

137
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,720
He, he, he, he, he, he's up there talking about a coffee, a fan of his coffee, or if it's a coffee

138
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:09,080
maker called Senseo. Um, and what he does is that is that he says, stop what you're doing right

139
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,800
now when you're listening to my podcast, and remember where you are and look around you and

140
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,040
you and focus on one object that you're looking at while you're listening to this. And I'm going

141
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,440
to say the word Senseo. And I guarantee you that every single time you look at that object or

142
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,680
or item, you're going to remember the word Senseo. And in he says, gee, I wonder if there's

143
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:37,320
something to that if there's some sort of advertising model from that. And so for me, I was actually

144
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,080
sitting outside of Starbucks listening to his podcast when he said that. So now, whenever I see that

145
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:51,640
the Starbucks logo, I'm thinking Senseo, which is kind of a weird kind of a weird thing. And

146
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,560
you know, maybe maybe I may start to move away from Starbucks towards Senseo. So I think that

147
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,080
that's kind of neat. Um, one thing that the funny thing is I, what I happen to when you said that

148
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,680
I happen to stare at at my pocket pegs, uh, the screen coolments, uh, oral catch strips. And,

149
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,360
you know, I guess with coffee breath, uh, that would come into play as well. So for for some reason,

150
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,200
the the object that I happen to look at had that contextual rid of and see as well.

151
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Uh, so it's a very, it's a very cool idea. I don't know what you do with it, but maybe you can

152
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,280
maybe if there's some like day part advertising or a pod part, uh, advertising. So that people

153
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,640
can sponsor like a minute. And, uh, and I don't know, maybe there's some somebody holding up some

154
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,480
way to capitalize on that. Well, I think it's, I think it's going to be probably the most expensive

155
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,320
slot to advertise on. That's what I think. Because you can't help yourself if you're listening and

156
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,320
someone says, okay, pick a spot. You don't, you know, you can't not want to do it. Because you're

157
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,320
already programmed. But the minute I say the minute you hear, I say, okay, pick a spot. You're already

158
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,640
lost, you know. Um, I think we actually have a conversation with the sense say, oh, people pretty

159
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,400
pretty soon. I'd love to do this with them because it does work. Um, if, well, I'm not going to do it

160
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,280
today. I'm not going to do it right now. Um, one thing was really disappointing. You know, I got this

161
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,600
great MDA, this T mobile, um, now I'm a T mobile customer and I pay monthly and they can direct

162
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,880
debit my account and all that. And they still have me on probation because I'm a new customer. I'm,

163
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,840
you know, so, um, if you go like 50 or 50 pounds over your a lot of budget or some shit like that

164
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,960
for your, you're, you're, you're predicted monthly build and immediately, uh, they stop outgoing calls.

165
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,720
They stop, uh, if you're roaming in a different country, uh, you can't send any outbound text or SMS.

166
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,920
You can only receive. And, uh, so this happened when I, when I arrived really late to Tuesday night.

167
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,520
And so I said, oh, I'll just hop on the website, um, and, uh, and, you know, top up my account there.

168
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,080
And of course, so the website didn't work. It was broken. Called the number, um, uh, they're open from 7 a.m.

169
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,880
So, you know, a UK time, 7 to 10 or something like that. So, I had to wait.

170
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,880
And really, it just pisses me off, you know, this whole, I guess they have no incentive to really

171
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,520
make it work, you know, this by this phone and you can travel the world and you can use it everywhere.

172
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,560
It's, you know, it's not true. It just doesn't work everywhere. You've got to continuously be in contact

173
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,440
with your, um, with your network provider to, to make all the bits and bytes, uh, gel at the same time.

174
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,120
And it's, uh, disappointing is what it is. Uh, what else did I want to say? There were a couple of,

175
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,080
oh, yeah. Um, so on this, this flight from hell that we had yesterday, they played,

176
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,000
since we were so delayed. They played five, five, count them five episodes of,

177
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,440
everybody loves Raymond. I don't love Raymond anymore after five episodes of that. But then they

178
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,160
played a movie in Chris and I looked at each other and I went, oh, man, this is going to be a real

179
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,360
chick movie. It was um, sisterhood of the traveling pants. I don't know if you've seen this, uh, this movie.

180
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,680
Uh, but it was a 100% chick flick. And, uh, and what I hated even more is it maybe cry.

181
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,200
It's just like, oh, man, it's a chick flick and I'm crying. This is, this is wrong. This is all wrong.

182
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,160
A little bit of pod save music now, although I realize it's actually it's not pod safe.

183
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,520
But I think I can get away with it for this one time. It is when the pod save music

184
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,360
network, Carmen Tyler, who has a couple of really, really good songs up there. This is a classic one,

185
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,600
kind of staying in our, in our Jazzy vibe, which, uh, well, the ASCAP BMI payments will take care of it.

186
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,320
But it's not pod safe every pod cast. It's summertime.

187
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:54,120
Summer time, and the living is easy. Fish on jumping, and the curtain is hot.

188
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,160
Your dad's rich, and your mama's good looking.

189
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:13,800
So hush, little baby, and don't you cry. So hush, little baby, and don't you cry.

190
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:25,960
One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing. Then you'll spread your wings

191
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:34,680
and you'll take to the sky. But till that morning, there's enough thing

192
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:45,960
I can't hold you. And death, you mama, standing by.

193
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:31,400
Summer time, and the living is easy. Fish on jumping, and the curtain is hot.

194
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:45,480
Your dad's rich, and your mama's good looking.

195
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,520
So hush, little baby, and don't you cry.

196
00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:05,960
So hush, little baby, and don't you cry.

197
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,880
Man, who is that girl? Carmen Tyler. K-A-R-M-Y-N Tyler with a Y as well.

198
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,360
Summer time, she also got a great song called The Guilty, which I'll be sure to play for you here on

199
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,560
The Daily Source Code. A couple of the things I wanted to mention. The podcast music network

200
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,160
where you can also pick that song up has a really cool new feature, which I just noticed earlier this

201
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,760
week. When you add a song to your playlist, and then you report it as played, it pops up a little

202
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,080
window that will automatically send an email to the artist who song that belongs to. And you

203
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,360
can edit the email, what it basically says. Hey, the Daily Source Code played your song in episode,

204
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,200
and of course it puts in the episode number that you tagged. And it sends it off to them, which is

205
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,680
it's a part really, it's social networking, which is great. And I've been playing a lot with

206
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:06,200
social networks recently. There's a lot of amazing stuff going on. We say so easily, you know,

207
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,080
social networking, but it's really just small little features that make it work so incredibly well,

208
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,680
just like that email that is sent off. And of course, it has a link back to my podcast page.

209
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:24,120
So it's really, it's very, very cool. Also, yeah, I wanted to thank the multitude of people

210
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,960
who have their Wi-Fi networks open. You know, my Wi-Fi networks have always been open all over the

211
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,040
world, wherever I've lived, and I've enjoyed using them, and coming into the Curry Condo with no

212
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:43,480
phone, no cable, and no internet connectivity. I must say absolutely phenomenal to see 15 open

213
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,560
networks just sitting there waiting for. We've of course, I'm up really high, so you have to be kind

214
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,960
of careful, because you can kind of get reflected bounces, you know, a car all drive by, and

215
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,400
all of a sudden you'll get five new networks, because, you know, the signal just bouncing off of

216
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,640
its straight up and through all the glass into the into the, into the pad. But I guess there's

217
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,200
a couple of people, what I must be, several people in the building, who also have Wi-Fi, and I've been

218
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:16,200
totally vibing on this three-com network. So anyone who has the networks open, thank you very much,

219
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,640
again, it's so much appreciated. You have really no idea.

220
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:40,280
Hey, yeah, this is hit, there's number 58. Hey, I'm on airplane.

221
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,800
I'll go back to the 1767 somewhere halfway, yet Atlantic, cruising at a speed of 500 miles

222
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:53,080
an hour, and the altitude of 33,000 feet. Young clearly has a hundred million dollars worth of

223
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,480
airplane strapped to as asked where today's hit does. With a lot of noise, cramps in between two

224
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,640
seats right in the middle of an airplane. So I can hardly type, I hope and confine to the function

225
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,960
keys to start everything. But there is a hit test, so here we go, this is number one.

226
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,880
Well, that's, I think it was certainly within the first hundred record I ever owned,

227
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Deon Warwick, heartbreaker. And number two.

228
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,120
Another one I should know was the first video of the year, the very first video of musical

229
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,000
awards, Don Henley, was the summer. And the final one is number three.

230
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:47,640
I recognize it. I do recognize it, but no. And times up and here are the answers

231
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:56,120
from a seat. What is it? 33 E in a 767. This is answer number one.

232
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,560
It's a start from 1983. It's Deon Warwick. This is a heartbreaker.

233
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:25,240
Love is really, but you and dad, I can't love you in your dreams.

234
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:35,400
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker when I was being but you are a baby?

235
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,440
It's got to be a dream that I love the moment.

236
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,240
It's past me love. It's a new world.

237
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm going to New York, New York, New York International Airport.

238
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,640
And see number one, Deon Warwick, heartbreaker. And this is answer number two.

239
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,240
From 84, Don Henley and the boys of summer.

240
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,760
Yeah. Saw that dead head sticker on the Cadillac.

241
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:51,960
And this is a third and final answer. Also sung from 1984. This is We Are Deon.

242
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,840
We Are Deon.

243
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,640
Then Hartman, We Are Deon.

244
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,760
The third and final answer in today's hit test.

245
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,800
From Continental Flight 71 to New York International Airport,

246
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,600
somewhere in the middle of the plane from the economy clash,

247
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,360
the packaging between my trifling companion and a total stranger.

248
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,640
Yeah.

249
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,560
I have totally no idea when I can mail you this one or upload it to the server.

250
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,920
I suppose to have me having free Wi-Fi at the hotel.

251
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,000
So, feedback is still welcome at hittest.gmail.com.

252
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,160
And the website, yonpolit.com is where you can find some info about the hittest and the hittest

253
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,560
box catch that's janpolyt.com. Well, thank you for listening.

254
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,960
Don't expect me to know when the next one will be.

255
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,880
I hope somewhere in the coming days. If not, you know why.

256
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,080
I'm having a good time in New York and I'm trying to do some nice things here.

257
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,160
So, until next time, bye-bye.

258
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,760
All right. Yonpolit from 37,000 fees.

259
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Sort of C33E is what it was on his way to Newark New Jersey.

260
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,520
Great Yon really appreciated.

261
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,520
Glad we could finally fit that one in.

262
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,760
Okay. So, that's it. Almost 35 minutes a little longer than I wanted to go.

263
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,400
I still got to do some production work. Then I'm going to head over to the office.

264
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,320
Which will be fun. And we've got two days of some hard work ahead of us. We've got some demos.

265
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,120
We're doing. We've got some folks coming into town tomorrow morning.

266
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,120
So, it's going to be pretty busy. Thank you very much for tuning in.

267
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:19,320
As always, dailysourcecode.com. I don't know. This may have been hosted not on our own podcast

268
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,560
delivery network, but maybe maybe I put it back on God Mac or something. So, hopefully,

269
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,040
this all arrives in good shape. We'll get everything fixed. And I can't do my signature sign-off

270
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,640
because the TSA Homeland Security confiscated my lighter. So, I can't click out of here. So,

271
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,680
we'll just leave it at this. I will see you tomorrow on the Daily Sourcecode.

272
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:48,600
Another pod show podcast. Stick it in your ear.
