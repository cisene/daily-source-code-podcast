00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Daily source code Episode 190

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Something remarkable is happening here.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,240
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear since

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,760
radio is invented.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,400
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I think I'm signing you to the future.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120
Hi, this is Rachel from audiocollective.net.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,120
You're listening to Adam Curry on the Daily Source code.

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
Hey everybody, it is Tuesday.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
It is June 7, 2005.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
Welcome to the source code.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
How are you?

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,680
A beautiful Tuesday, I might not have the sun is shining.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
It's just how man, it couldn't be more perfect.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,960
The weather is beautiful, the trees are in full glory, flowers are in bloom.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm feeling pretty horny myself.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,040
This is your Daily Source code at the start of 190.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,400
A lot of cool stuff to talk about.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
Lots of promos on today's show may even run a little bit long.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
Might even be a 40 minute podcast.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,640
So, as you can tell, probably immediately from the quality of the microphone.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm back on the regular mic.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,960
I decided I just need a new windows machine in order to test the cast glass.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
So, this is tablet or crap with as I call as just such a piece of shit.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,560
Particularly because you'll hear later on, young polette used cast blaster to do the hit test

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,080
that ain't as sensitive to awesome.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,600
So, until then, I'll just roll that out on the Mac.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,320
Now, we start off a little bit rough this morning.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,480
Christina had lost her glasses.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Turns out she had lost them for over a week, but had she really lost them.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
We're had she lent them to someone.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,920
It's another one of those fine parenting kid moments, you know, just better load that.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
So, and I was going to go to the gym with Patricia.

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,640
The deal is now we go Tuesdays and Fridays.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,640
However, we'd forgotten that the work crew was going to show up today to start fixing the windows.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,760
If you've been listening to the source code for a couple of months, you'll know that the insulation

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,040
of the house is not exactly what it could be and gets really, really cold in the winter.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,160
So, they're fixing up the windows, I guess they're doing double pain glass and stuff like that.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,880
So, if you hear any banging in the background, no, I haven't moved temporarily to the

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,000
Bunger and Amsterdam, or the sex club, it's just the plainhold cottage.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
Let's kick it off with a mashup, shall we?

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
You'll like this one. Black IP's versus the stellar project.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
Send to us by Martin Peters.

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
That's what you want me to use on you.

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,840
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

47
00:04:36,880 --> 00:05:06,880

52
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
Martin sent us such a wonderful collection of mashups.

53
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
If you've got something you want to play it on the source code,

54
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
press a promo, just send it to submit at podshow.com.

55
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,080
OK, so something really exciting happened yesterday.

56
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,760
In San Francisco, it was the 2005 Worldwide

57
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,000
Developers Conference for Apple.

58
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,400
And as its traditional Steve Jobs did a keynote,

59
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
it wasn't done live the keynote, but I guess

60
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,160
delayed for some reason.

61
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,520
And today it showed up on the Apple homepage.

62
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
And of course, I was already

63
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,920
learned to the fact that Steve Jobs did his now infamous

64
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,880
iTunes podcast demo, which he'd already

65
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,040
done from me in a private session.

66
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,760
And that sounds kind of scary, doesn't it?

67
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,000
Private session, means D.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,200
And now I did it for the Wall Street Journal

69
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,960
DeConference, and I did it for all the developers.

70
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
And a lot of developers there, like two or 3000.

71
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Let's just walk through this for a second, because it's

72
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,400
I just want to play some of the audio.

73
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,880
It was probably about just about this time last year, right?

74
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,680
Yeah, it was around June.

75
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,880
Dave Winner was at the Democratic National Convention,

76
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,960
I think, maybe a little bit before that.

77
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,840
He started to add MP3 recordings that he was doing

78
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,200
on the street and at the convention in different places

79
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
into his RSS feed.

80
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,360
And we've been doing this for quite a while together,

81
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,840
sending back audio, mainly video I have to say, as in closures.

82
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,960
And so I was receiving these automatically

83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,120
through radio, user land.

84
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,520
And I was thinking, oh, man, I really

85
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,280
want this to go straight onto my iPod.

86
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,040
I'm so sick and tired of dragging it over.

87
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,080
At the time, I had an early commute for the morning show.

88
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,080
And that was kind of what planted the seed to build the first

89
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,880
iPod or client.

90
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,360
And look at where we've come in less than a year, really,

91
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
just about a year's time.

92
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,680
Look how far we've come.

93
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,280
It's unbelievable that as users of a technology,

94
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,640
users of a platform, users of, in my case,

95
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,080
a Mac user, of course, it's gone way beyond Mac and Tosh

96
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,840
at this point.

97
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,120
I wanted some functionality.

98
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,560
And thank God there was capability.

99
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,760
Thank God for, I never thought you'd hear me say this.

100
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,400
Thank God for Apple script.

101
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Because that's why I built the first iPod or it.

102
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,360
But thank God the Apple for listening, for paying attention,

103
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
listening to what their customers really want.

104
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,200
And yeah, I may be a loudmouth customer,

105
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
but I'm still a customer.

106
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,800
And I've been a Mac user since I had the Mac 2 or the Apple 2.

107
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,960
Didn't really do much with it.

108
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,600
It was really the Mac Plus that the company started, obviously.

109
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,560
So let's just have a listen to a little bit.

110
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Not linked to up here and there with a few comments.

111
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
No, iTunes goes with the iPod.

112
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,560
And we just recently crossed 430 million songs sold

113
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,680
and download it in iTunes.

114
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
We're thrilled with this.

115
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,280
And by the way, I think I've mentioned this before.

116
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,960
The entire percentage of downloaded paid for music online.

117
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,080
As a percentage of all music sales.

118
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,360
So it's 430 million songs sold through the iTunes Music Store.

119
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
That and the other music stores that are available

120
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,040
represents 2% of all music sales.

121
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
So let's just keep that in perspective,

122
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,840
but it's still an amazing amount of downloaded song.

123
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,000
And that is again reflected in iTunes Market Share.

124
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,760
We've gotten a lot of competition over the last nine months.

125
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,680
And what's happened?

126
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,280
Our market share is going up.

127
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,960
It's now 82% in the month of May.

128
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Right on.

129
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:05,640
Now, we recently announced something new for iTunes and iPod.

130
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
And it's called podcasting.

131
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,760
As you know, the podcasting phenomenon is exploding right now.

132
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
And podcasting, of course, is a concatenation of iPod and broadcasting.

133
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
And what is podcasting?

134
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,680
It's been described a lot of different ways.

135
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,200
One way has been a TV for radio.

136
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah, I like TV for radio, although I hate what happened to TV.

137
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,200
Their business model didn't work out very well, but the functionality is definitely

138
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
TV for radio.

139
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
And by the way, explain TV to someone.

140
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,920
That's almost as hard as explaining podcasting if you're talking about subscribing to a

141
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
show.

142
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
But it is indeed, TV for radio.

143
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,760
If you have a TV, then you get it immediately.

144
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,040
Download radio shows and listen to them on your computer or put them on your iPod any

145
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
time you want.

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,160
So it's just like television programs on TV.

147
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
And that's true.

148
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,240
Another way it's been described is Wayne's world for radio.

149
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,240
He's been listening to too much Don and Drew, which means that anyone without much capital

150
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,240
investment can make a podcast, put it on a server and get a worldwide audience for their

151
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
radio show.

152
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,280
And that's true, too.

153
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,120
We see it as the hottest thing going in radio, hotter than anything else in radio.

154
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,760
I'd really like that description.

155
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Boy, does that put all of us in a really cool category?

156
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,520
The hottest thing in radio, congratulations, y'all.

157
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,560
And as you know, what podcasting is is that you can not only download radio shows and listen

158
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
to them, you can subscribe to them.

159
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,280
So that every time there's a new episode, it automatically gets downloaded to your computer,

160
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,360
you can listen to it there or it automatically gets synced to your iPod the next time

161
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
you dock your iPod.

162
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
There you go.

163
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Perfect explanation.

164
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
So it's very, very exciting.

165
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,440
And there are over 8,000 podcasts now.

166
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,800
Now that's interesting.

167
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,080
Pay attention to that because it's going to become very relevant when you start talking

168
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,680
about the directory.

169
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
8,000 podcasts.

170
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:05,440
I just looked today in iPod.org, we have 6,000 and I think 72 podcasts currently listed.

171
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,760
So Apple clearly has a few more or found a few more or has registered more or whatever,

172
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
but they're talking 8,000.

173
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
So that's good.

174
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,080
It's a bigger number than iPod.org is currently tracking.

175
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,760
So that is good news in my book.

176
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
This is growing really, really fast.

177
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
So that's pretty exciting.

178
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't wait to see a pie chart.

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,080
Next time Steve does a keynote, we'll say in June of 2005, there were 8,000 podcasts.

180
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,800
And today, and then I'll show the pie chart and it'll be like 80,000.

181
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Now, it's not just amateurs doing these things though.

182
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
These 8,000 are not all amateurs.

183
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
The pros.

184
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,520
Okay, that's where it comes up with the 8,000 number.

185
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I got you.

186
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,080
I don't think we're tracking all of the, quote, pros in the iPod.org directory, probably

187
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,640
because they just haven't submitted it.

188
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Have realized that this is huge.

189
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,160
And here's just a list of some of the companies doing podcasts now.

190
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,440
All the major radio broadcasters, the network broadcaster.

191
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
That's kind of cool.

192
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
The serious was up on the board.

193
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,120
Major news papers, even major companies like Disney and Proctor and Gamble and Ford and General

194
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Motors.

195
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Yeah, what's that?

196
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
So it's pretty exciting.

197
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,120
And so what we're doing is we're going to make this even easier because you're not

198
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,000
going to have to go download other applications and get all sorts of stuff together to

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
make this happen.

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,280
We're going to build it right in to iTunes and iPods.

201
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,440
Okay, so here's what I, if, and I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs and his keynote, I'm a

202
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,800
student of Steve Jobs and his keynote speeches.

203
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
I love the way he presents.

204
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I am you late a lot of, a lot of his presentation style.

205
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,120
I just naturally have ever since you could follow these keynote on in quick time.

206
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,560
Man, when that started, it was 2001, I guess, 2002, when it really started to, you know,

207
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
when these keynotes were just the biggest thing, there would be watching and have them

208
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,920
up on on projectors and we'd have watching parties and it was fun, fun to watch the

209
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,240
really what like watching and present something at this point though, it would have been

210
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,800
nice to just made a brief mention to the hundreds of people who helped foster this,

211
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,040
who developed it, who, particularly the developers, man, the developers worked and this

212
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,400
was a developer's conference, so it might have been a very appropriate thing to mention.

213
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:25,800
There were so many independent developers who were creating iPodder functionality with existing

214
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,680
software such as iTunes, but also others Windows Media Player, of course, he's not going

215
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,720
to mention that.

216
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,200
So that just would have been really nice and not just the developers and the software

217
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,560
sense, but also the developers who've been developing podcasting, have been working tirelessly

218
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,200
together to come up with naming conventions for file names, how to use your ID three tags,

219
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,320
which are all messed up anyway and are intended for music and not for podcasting at all.

220
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,360
That just would have been a nice little note and would have been very appropriate.

221
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Okay, we continue.

222
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:03,960
Can subscribe to any podcast and we're going to make it really easy and so right into iTunes.

223
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Fantastic opportunity, by the way, to have also said, hey, this is our customers, our

224
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,240
customers love our stuff so much that they're stringing stuff together.

225
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,320
We hadn't even thought of that would have been cool.

226
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,280
Very simple, but one of the most important things is how do you find these podcasts?

227
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Do you want people typing URLs into iTunes?

228
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
Well, they could do that.

229
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,440
There you go.

230
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,080
I know I've said it before, but now we can talk about it openly.

231
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,040
Of course, you'll be able to subscribe to any podcast you want as long as it has an RSS

232
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,800
2.0 feed, it'll work in iTunes.

233
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,960
But we're also going to build right into the iTunes Music Store, an iPodcast directory.

234
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Right on.

235
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,960
So, you know that when I first started the iPodot org directory, it was built on OPML meant

236
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,960
to be open, so they're doing exactly the right thing.

237
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,000
They're taking the iPodot org directory, I'm sure they're going to be taking podcast.net

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,120
and podcast alley, and you name it all directories that are open and available through

239
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,640
OPML or other means that the data can be accessed.

240
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,040
They're going to be sucking that in continuously, by the way.

241
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,520
It's not going to be a one-time deal.

242
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,600
And they're going to bring it all in to make, I guess, the biggest directory they can,

243
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,080
which is exactly the way OPML directories are intended to be, no one owns the top level.

244
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,800
In fact, I want to have my own personal directory, a directory that only has categories

245
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,200
that I'm interested in, and I can track that myself, and hopefully Dave Winner's OPML

246
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,320
software will facilitate for that.

247
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,400
I think it will, hopefully we'll see more of that at NomeDex.

248
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,720
He's already hinting about it on scripting.com, so I guess something's coming pretty soon.

249
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,600
I got a register and get my hands on that.

250
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,200
So the directory is going to be pretty big, it's 8,000 as we've heard, and they're all

251
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
going to be in there.

252
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,320
So I think pretty much everyone who has a podcast will be listed.

253
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,080
If not, I guarantee you, there is a way, and there will be ways for you to get listed.

254
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,520
D-listing, on the other hand, will kind of happen, I think, in the way that makes sense

255
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
to Apple.

256
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,640
I presume that the way it's going to happen, of course, if I told you what's really going

257
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,920
to happen, I have to shoot all of you, is that people can complain about a podcast or send

258
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,040
a note, and then it might be reviewed and could be removed from the Apple directory.

259
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,520
Out of course, as they're prerogative, what I hope and what I am pushing for is that

260
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,480
at the back end of the Apple directory, they will output a file that can be used by other

261
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,400
directories to suck into that directory as well, to essentially become a node in a global

262
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,920
directory structure.

263
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,400
Not quite sure if that's going to work, but I am pushing for it.

264
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,160
So we're going to list thousands of podcasts, and you'll be able to click on them, download

265
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,520
them for free, and subscribe to them right in iTunes.

266
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,720
So I'd just like to give you a quick peek of what this is going to look like.

267
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
All right.

268
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,200
So this is the point where I pull my pants down.

269
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:01,720
Let me bring up iTunes here, and I'm going to go to the podcast homepage, and this

270
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,160
is the podcast directory, and we're going to list again, thousands of podcasts.

271
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,960
Let's just go ahead and listen to one.

272
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
We can go to one here.

273
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
This is Adam Curry.

274
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,160
He's one of the inventors of podcasting, and you could listen to his episode 107.

275
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Hold on.

276
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
I have to touch myself.

277
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,120
So you could listen to an episode here, but it's much more interesting to subscribe

278
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
to the podcast.

279
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
And we've now subscribed to Adam Curry's podcast.

280
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
It's flipped us up to this podcast thing, right in the source list.

281
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
It's downloaded the most recent one if I want to download another one.

282
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
I can just push a button and go download one of the older episodes, and I can listen

283
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
to an episode.

284
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,680
The source code episode 187, something remarkable is happening here.

285
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,280
Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who managed what you can hear since radio

286
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,520
was invented.

287
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,000
It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.

288
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:11,200
All right, he's laughing because he's thinking, you've got $16 million worth of aircraft

289
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,040
strapped to your ass.

290
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I got $43 million worth of aircraft strapped to my ass.

291
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,480
Oh, let me give you another one.

292
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Adam's great.

293
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,640
Oh, I got touched by self again.

294
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,120
Yeah, that was very cool.

295
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,280
This is, this is case.

296
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:37,800
And notice by the way that what Steve calls the amateur podcast, get all the big laugh.

297
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
And then he goes into demoing some of the pro stuff.

298
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,120
Our W, this is a show called The Treatment There, a public radio station in LA, so let me

299
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,960
go ahead and subscribe to The Treatment.

300
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,040
And again, here's another one I can close this one if I want to.

301
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,240
And let's go listen to the treatment.

302
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,960
This podcast of The Treatment is a production of KCRW Santa Monica at 89.9 FM and web

303
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,520
casting at KCRW.com.

304
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,920
From KCRW in Santa Monica, this is The Treatment.

305
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,880
So you can hear a pin drop that's like crickets go on now because it's boring.

306
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Hello.

307
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Welcome to boring.

308
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
But you get the idea.

309
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,440
Really cool, summer amateur and summer pro of interesting, very interesting.

310
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,320
What's amateur on what's pro and does it really matter anymore?

311
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,600
More I want to just highlight and but I think what basically what I just, the message

312
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:30,080
I just got subliminally, it's subliminally, subliminally is amateur, fun, cool, like it,

313
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
pro.

314
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,000
We're going to do one ourselves because we have new music Tuesdays when we put new music

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
on the iTunes music store.

316
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
So we decided to do a podcast.

317
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
This is just a test.

318
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Mm-hmm.

319
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,960
But you can, is it pro or amateur?

320
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Subscribe to that and, you know, get to, so what's really cool about what you showed

321
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,240
here is something that I saw as well.

322
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,600
I guess I can talk about now.

323
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,440
Art work changes too.

324
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,720
Basically, yeah, with this new set up that I, that iTunes will be using.

325
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,760
Go to different chapters of this thing.

326
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,560
You'll be able to synchronize the track of artwork and the artwork is hot, clickable.

327
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,560
It's linkable to any kind of URL to another podcast, oh man, how fucking cool is that

328
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
going to be?

329
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,120
If I roll out a promo for a podcast, you'll see the artwork for that promo and you can

330
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,920
click on a link and that link will either, I guess I could do multiple links, excuse me,

331
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,080
I get so excited since I was acting up.

332
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,880
Cool links, one could be to listen to that podcast or one could be to automatically subscribe

333
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
you to that podcast.

334
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,800
I think about what this is going to do for sound-seeing tours.

335
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,240
God, this is going to be so cool.

336
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,200
I think you can actually, the artwork could also be a quick time movie.

337
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Imagine the shit we can do.

338
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,440
I haven't seen the whole SDK, the software developers kit yet, but I will.

339
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,560
But I think there's going to be a lot of really cool stuff possible with this new combination

340
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
of iTunes.

341
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:07,240
Sorry, it's rolling through the chapters, very, very simple.

342
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:14,240
And we think it's going to basically take podcasting mainstream or anyone can do it and

343
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,000
really easy to find these podcasts, really easy to listen to.

344
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,400
Right, so that has been the entire mission that I've been on for a year, taking it mainstream.

345
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Now that may seem like a nasty word, taking it mainstream, because we speak of mainstream

346
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,120
media, but I think really this is going to open up a universe of people who will be able

347
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,040
to listen to our shows, who will be able to enjoy it, who will be able to laugh at the

348
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,800
amateurs and fall asleep during the pro stuff.

349
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
It's going to be fantastic.

350
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Sorry about this.

351
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,040
I think it's going to be one more way to sell iPods, and there you go.

352
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,840
Digital music community are really at the forefront of this stuff, bringing the innovation

353
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
into the marketplace.

354
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,560
Okay, no, that was kind of the thank you.

355
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
That was nice.

356
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,200
The innovation into the marketplace, and I personally want to thank all of the developers

357
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,880
once again, everybody who's been working so incredibly hard to get to this point.

358
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,360
And there's so much more we can do.

359
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,680
In fact, I'm looking out west, looking way, way, way out west up to the northwest.

360
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm, wait a minute, can we do some, uh, one of you can, uh, hello, hello, redmond,

361
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,440
redmondy, read me, redmond, come in redmond, redmond, we are waiting for your podcast

362
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
functionality.

363
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Where are you?

364
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Hey Adam, and all the daily source code listeners, this is Tracy from the vegan cooking

365
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,720
school podcast, where we introduce listeners to a vegan lifestyle and had a prepared vegan

366
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
dishes.

367
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,720
You don't have to be a vegan to listen to this so though, but you do have to love delicious

368
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,520
new trishes meals.

369
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,600
So listen to us, download us at vegancookingschool.com.

370
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Thanks Adam, bye.

371
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,960
The motitudes went forth and cast their pods in the direction of all who would listen

372
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,560
and casting their pods in this manner, they were henceforth known as podcasters.

373
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:24,840
This is Chad, and this is Erica, and we're getting married, and it hasn't been

374
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
easy.

375
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,960
Airlines strikes, hotel plumbing problems, we've changed the date twice, and all of

376
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,280
us in the span of 21 days.

377
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Join us for our countdown to chaos, as we plan the happiest day of our life.

378
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
And we live to talk about it.

379
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Here we have had to face so far.

380
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Hey, stick around, something else could possibly go wrong.

381
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Yeah, dot org slash wedding cast, that's www.weaca.org slash wedding cast.

382
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,280
And crap, I think four boards have been pulled up to the front of the house.

383
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Oh man, you know I'm going to subscribe to that, when that's going to be great to follow

384
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Chad and Erica on their on the way to wedded bliss, that'll be cool, it's the wedding

385
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
cast.

386
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Of course, all of the URLs, the places to subscribe to these podcasts can all be found

387
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,280
in the show notes for today's podcast.

388
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,280
We still have some great pod safe music tune on the way, a little bit too much reverb

389
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,000
down, and just tone that down.

390
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,680
We've got, oh, a hit test, young pull, that's been added again, and shoot, man, I got

391
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,280
so many promos didn't play any yesterday, got to catch up.

392
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,480
Hello, ham, which a towel wrought the first five minutes with which a towel, and I'm here

393
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,280
to tell you about the podcast, 4-1-1 podcast.

394
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Now, Rob, he interviews other podcasters to find out what they've learned about doing a

395
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,280
podcast, and it's been described as, he inside the actor's studio.

396
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
He's having this for podcasts.

397
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,280
His past guests include Alan Curry, he's the pod father, Senator John Edwards, C.C.

398
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Chapman, P.K. and J, B.B.B. and he asked Chris Rockwell, and yours truly, which is

399
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
the towel wrought the first.

400
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
That's just naming a few of them.

401
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Now, if you want to learn more about podcasters and your podcasters, then you go

He's just so precious.

406
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
podcasting.

407
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
He's Adam Curry.

408
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,280
Hey, Adam, it's Mike from Weird News of the World podcast.

409
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,280
We're available at Weird News of the World.

410
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
We've got Vlogspot.com.

411
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Each week, my buddy, Jim and my other buddy, Jim and I.

412
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,280
We need and discuss some of your weird news stories from around the world.

413
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
We also have some pod save music.

414
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,280
And, you know, we try and put in a little bit of trivia in there.

415
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
So, please come out and check out our website again.

416
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,280
It's, you know, weird news of the world.

417
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Vlogspot.com.

418
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,280
And, hey, Adam, we're interested in testing cast blasters.

419
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
So, let us know when it's ready, okay?

420
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Thanks.

421
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Right on Jim, Mike.

422
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Most definitely cast blaster is on its way to a public data release.

423
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,280
I've had, well, as you know, I've had my, my minor issues with the, with the craplet,

424
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
getting that to work perfectly.

425
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Of course, I had the cheapest piece of shit out there.

426
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
But it looks like we're very, very close.

427
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,280
We're going to get the website up and rolling.

428
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,280
We're working on the, well, I call it the front-to-back process,

429
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,280
which means you record and you hit save and all the rest is taken care of.

430
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Your RSS feed, your show blog, everything is all done.

431
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Your file is placed on an FTP server.

432
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
It's going to be a lot of fun.

433
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
So, stay tuned for that.

434
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,280
That's coming up either the end of this week or the beginning of next week.

435
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,280
We'll have everything ready to roll for the, for the big public data.

436
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
By the way, all the promos you hear on today's source code have also been played.

437
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,280
And we'll be replayed on the pod show on serious satellite.

438
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,280
And thanks to PW Fenton for, for all the tireless hours he's putting in,

439
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,280
sifting through all of the promos, making sure they're cleaned up, making sure they're,

440
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,280
they're ready to be put into, into the pod show.

441
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,280
And of course, you know, he's basically helping me out now with the source code.

442
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Because, yeah, I just, I'm exposed all this stuff.

443
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
And I've got someone helping me on finding the promos.

444
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
I really appreciate it.

445
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,280
And I put out a call, I said, please, let's have shorter pod cast some longer promos.

446
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Particularly for the pod show, that's great.

447
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Because it gives people the opportunity to, you know, listen,

448
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,280
make a decision about, hey, that sounds kind of interesting.

449
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,280
And then rolling off and basically subscribing or auditioning to it on the website

450
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,280
and then subscribing to it, or, you know, however else you want to get them.

451
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Soon that'll be made easy, of course, in iTunes.

452
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,280
And the longer promos, you know, so shorter pod casting, that's just necessary.

453
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
We already have 8,000 according to Apple.

454
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,280
And I think we will have 80,000 by this time next year.

455
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,280
So you have to find ways to, to get your audience.

456
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,280
No matter who it is, you have to, you know, if you, even if you're just doing a wedding

457
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
cast, you can have to find that wedding audience.

458
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,280
So promos are a great way to do it.

459
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,280
I love the example of which a Todd doing the promo for pod cast four on one.

460
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
So this, like, two promos on one.

461
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
You guys are really getting good.

462
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
I don't think we can call you amateurs anymore.

463
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Since the creepy sleepy show began pod casting, public opinion has been bitterly divided.

464
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,280
So we decided to take it to the people to find out their reactions.

465
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Rolling off the blunt.

466
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,280
Yeah.

467
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Sir, what are your opinions on the creepy sleepy show pod cast?

468
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I just, in a nutshell, think it's a bad idea to promote something that I think is not good for society and the public.

469
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Sir, the market research on the creepy sleepy show has to this point Ben.

470
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,280
In conclusive, what are your opinions?

471
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Well, I think the medical center of research has been done to show that it is less offensive than alcohol.

472
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Whereas alcohol is legalized.

473
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
No.

474
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Market research, not medical research.

475
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Ma'am, do you think the creepy sleepy show is actually bad for people?

476
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,280
It's not as dangerous as stuff like cigarettes and stuff like that.

477
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,280
You get high off of the creepy sleepy show.

478
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Are you sure you're not talking about something else?

479
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Yes, I may have smoke weed.

480
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Like, ma'am, some people have equated downloading internet content and podcasts like the creepy sleepy show to piracy.

481
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
I think that's the issue.

482
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:44,280
I think the issue is a lot of people use it a lot of people find it enjoyable and they've been forced into being criminals and it's ridiculous.

483
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Ma'am, I'm not sure.

484
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Are you talking about the legalistic implications of downloading internet content like the creepy sleepy show or pod?

485
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Oh, yes, I smoke marijuana.

486
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Maybe two or three times a week.

487
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
What?

488
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,280
We're talking about pod casting, not marijuana.

489
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Ma'am, how do you feel about the social implications of the creepy sleepy show pod cast being able to reach a worldwide audience?

490
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,280
I think it's a bad issue when someone's on the ticket.

491
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
The little one says, you know, coming up.

492
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,280
But in other words, as a one for dad, they're not that think it's okay.

493
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Have you tried to download the creepy sleepy show pod cast?

494
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
Do you think it's habit forming?

495
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
That's right.

496
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
But I'm not saying that made it so bad.

497
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Try it.

498
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Wait.

499
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Are you talking about weed too?

500
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Sir, you've indicated that you really enjoy the creepy sleepy show.

501
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Can you tell us what the creepy sleepy show has done for you?

502
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
I'm smoking grass now.

503
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
I guess we're about five years or so.

504
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Really?

505
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
I think it's helping me more than anything.

506
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
I really become creative when I get high.

507
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,280
Sir, we're talking about the creepy sleepy show.

508
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Not marijuana.

509
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Do you have any comments about our show?

510
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
So I'm in a music a lot.

511
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,280
So I can really get into a more run and firm stone.

512
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
And I really don't think that it's hurt me.

513
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
In a way, at least nine physical symptoms.

514
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
I can't find it hard to breathe or anything.

515
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
I don't think it's hurt my memory.

516
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Do I have to tell you I'm subscribed to this podcast?

517
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Well, yeah, I'd say yeah.

518
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I'll leave you either.

519
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
The creepy sleepy show.

520
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
Pod cast for potheads.

521
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,280
No, I mean, it's not weed.

522
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,280
We're broadcasting all's live.

523
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Adam Curry.

524
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Why are we even filming this?

525
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Playback.

526
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,280
And action.

527
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Our airways are under attack.

528
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Who will save us from the lane DJs and crappy music of conventional radio?

529
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
I'll save your body.

530
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
It's part-tastic to the rescue.

531
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Cut.

532
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Cut.

533
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Can we cut Sean?

535
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Could you come here?

536
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
What?

537
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Sean the line is I'll save you.

538
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Not I'll save you.

539
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I said, shave, you're filthy bastard.

540
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Well, is there any way we could just get you to do it one more time?

541
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Yeah, with what money?

542
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
You only paid me for 60 seconds.

543
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Yeah, I know that's kind of all we could afford.

544
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,280
But I was just hoping maybe one more time is like a favor to us.

545
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,280
I'll do you the favor of not ripping your new actual.

546
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
How about that?

547
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Just get me my job.

548
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Okay, so that didn't quite work out as planned,

549
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
but please listen to our podcast.

550
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Anyway, it's called Pop 4 and we'll be talking about TV music movies.

551
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Everything in the pop culture as well as cooking, technology,

552
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,280
all kinds of random ship that we come up with.

553
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
And we think we're going to have a good time.

554
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Listen to it.

555
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
We hope to have me even better time making it.

556
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
You can visit us at www.pop4.net.

557
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,280
P-O-K-W-H-O-R-E.net for the podcast feed, the blog,

558
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,280
and info about what we're going to be doing.

559
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Hope to see you soon.

560
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Right on.

561
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Back to you, Adam.

562
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Thank you very much.

563
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Okay, Pop 4.net.

564
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Oh, man, I love this stuff.

565
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Oh, man.

566
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
I think the amateurs have it.

567
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Amateurs for pros, niddles.

568
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Patricia just walked in and she came back from the gym.

569
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
And guess what?

570
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
We're now signed up as a couple.

571
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Well, after I post the show and the show notes,

572
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
I'm off to the gym.

573
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Okay, Pod Safe Music Time.

574
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Let me see.

575
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Are you going to love this one?

576
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
By the way, this is the point in the show where I would say

577
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
if you're offended by strong mature language,

578
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I really want to tune out.

579
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
But then again, why the heck are you listening to this podcast

580
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
in the first place, huh?

581
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Amateur Transplants.

582
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Just talk about the Northern Birds.

583
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Spot Safe.

584
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Is that okay?

585
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
And my name is Stephen Business.

586
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Where amateurs plans?

587
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
This is a public service announcement for women.

588
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,280
If you go to Baltimore,

589
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,280
if you go to Manchester or Crue,

590
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
you cause a risk or a bribe,

591
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,280
your cost comes for Bradford Barnsley too.

592
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Or Grimsley,

593
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Listen up to what we have to say.

594
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,280
Northern Birds are lazy ugly horses,

595
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,280
smell of burgers.

596
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
So don't have too much to drink,

597
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
or you might fuck one,

598
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,280
and end up getting aches.

599
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
There's nothing fun

600
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
to be found of the M1.

601
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Northern Birds are lower claws,

602
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,280
slacks who take it up the hours.

603
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,280
There in the sack,

604
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,280
after one side there and black.

605
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,280
But they're fucking awful rise,

606
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,280
and you'll take won't such the sights.

607
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,

608
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:08,280
more than men's da-da-da-da-da.

609
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,280
If you really have to go up north,

610
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,280
then follow our advice,

611
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,280
fight away the women.

612
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Or you'll find yourself with cubicle eyes,

613
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,280
and her knees,

614
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,280
you're much better staying in the south,

615
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Northern Birds are desperately hippos,

616
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
dressed in burberry,

617
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,280
with a peanut for a brain,

618
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:56,280
and an accent that makes you want to die.

619
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Now you've been warned,

620
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,280
there won't physically deform,

621
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Northern Birds are all obese,

622
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,280
and they're riddled with disease,

623
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
try to escape.

624
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Northern sex is worse and worse.

625
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Stay down south,

626
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,280
and mark my worst,

627
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,280
still well clear of Northern Birds.

628
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,280
And this concludes our social studies as a class for today.

629
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Regarding UK socio-economics.

630
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Oh man, that's horrible.

631
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Now before you go start writing the emails,

632
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,280
of course, it's only partially pod safe.

633
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
As long as you're paying ASCAP and BMI fees,

634
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
which you can legally do now,

635
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,280
this is very much the way cover will cover,

636
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,280
cover,

637
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
the very much the way cover will work,

638
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,280
it's Brian Abbott from Colorado.

639
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
As long as you have the permission

640
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
of the owner of the master of that song,

641
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
in this case,

642
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I have the permission to play the song.

643
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
You can play any hit record,

644
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
basically, as long as it's a cover,

645
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
as long as it's done by someone else,

646
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
it gives you the rights to play it.

647
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
You still have to pay for the rights

648
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,280
to the composer of the music and or the lyrics.

649
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,280
So that is another route around that you might want to be thinking about.

650
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
There's a karaoke cast somewhere, isn't that?

651
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
I saw that.

652
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
I think I'm subscribed to that.

653
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Thank you very much, guys.

654
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Amateur Transplants, Northern Birds.

655
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Lovely.

656
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Pod safe, but not Chelsea.

657
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,280
He's back.

658
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
He's back.

659
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
He's back.

660
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
He's back.

661
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
He's back.

662
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
He's back.

663
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
He's back.

664
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Hey, Adam.

665
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
This is hit test number 41.

666
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Recorded with a cast blaster, better 14.

667
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
All right.

668
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Again, three intros and three answers.

669
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Sounds great.

670
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
This is intro number one.

671
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Oh yeah.

672
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
That song makes you happy.

673
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,280
That would be Rolling Stones between a rock and a hard path.

674
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
This is intro number two.

675
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
That's my music.

676
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Okay.

677
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I know this one too.

678
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,280
That's shines sweet freedom by Michael McDonald.

679
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,280
And the final one for today is number three.

680
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
I know I'm going to say, oh yeah, when I hear it.

681
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
I don't know that one.

682
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,280
And your time is up in this is answer number one.

683
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
The Rolling Stones.

684
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,280
This is between a rock and a hard place.

685
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Yeah.

686
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
I'm going to go straight.

687
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,280
We're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

688
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
And a hard place.

689
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,280
The Rolling Stones answer number one in today's hit test.

690
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
And this is answer number two.

691
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
From the movie running scared.

692
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,280
This is Michael McDonald's and sweet freedom.

693
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
You are the magic.

694
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
You are the magic.

695
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
You are the magic.

696
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
You are the magic.

697
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
You are the magic.

698
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
You are the magic.

699
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
You are the magic.

700
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Now what was number three, y'all.

701
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Sweet freedom Michael McDonald's answer number two in today's hit test.

702
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
And this is the third and final answer.

703
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,280
It's a dance classic from Cheryl Lynn.

704
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,280
This is shake it up to us.

705
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Yeah, I told you to go, oh yeah.

706
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Hmm, remember that?

707
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Where were your young friends?

708
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
I've been known to shake it up.

709
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Cheryl Lynn, answer number three in today's hit test.

710
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Well, that's it.

711
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,280
By the way, like you with the crapless, I have the same problems with the low volume output of my notes.

712
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,280
So I think I will be looking for a headphone amplifier.

713
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
There you go.

714
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,280
I've noticed there are USB versions, but also external versions with power adapters.

715
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
So I don't know which ones right.

716
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,280
So if there are people that have experienced with these kinds of amplifiers,

717
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
please let me know.

718
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,280

719
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,280

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Well, then, that's it for hit test number 41.

723
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
See you next time.

724
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
Bye-bye.

725
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
All right, y'all.

726
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
Thank you very much.

727
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Sound good, though.

728
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
It sounded much better than my crap.

729
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Thank you young palette for the hit test right here on your daily source curve.

730
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,280
And that's it for today.

731
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
What'd we do?

732
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Oh, man.

733
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
43 or 44 minutes.

734
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Whoop.

735
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
Long one.

736
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
All righty.

737
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280

As long as you don't mind me slicing and dicing and put it up into the source curve.

743
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,280
It's potsafe and potshow.com mashup at potshow.com.

744
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,280
And for everything else, submit at potshow.com.

www.curry.com.

750
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,280
I'm out of steam.

751
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
There's been a long show.

752
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
I got to get off to the gym.

753
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Okay, lots of exciting stuff coming in the next couple of weeks.

754
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Beyond the lookout for the grand premiere of the potsafe music network.

755
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
I know I've been talking about it.

756
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
CC Chapman's working on that.

757
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
We got Chris Rockwell working on that.

758
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,280
It's a lot of cool stuff coming down the pike.

759
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,280
Great place for not just people who have potsafe music.

760
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,280
They want to share, but are placed for potcasters to go and get potsafe music

761
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,280
and find out about it.

762
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,280
Find out what's being played, what's hot.

763
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Yes.

764
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,280
It's just like those big guys, the pros.

765
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,280
But the amateur's still got it, I think.

766
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Alrighty, I'll be back tomorrow for the Hum Day edition of the Daily Source Code.

767
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,280
Thank you very much for listening.

768
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
Stay subscribed.

769
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,280
And I'll see you later.

770
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Bye-bye.

771
