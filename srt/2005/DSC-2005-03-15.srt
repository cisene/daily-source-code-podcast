1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Transmitters, we don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Everybody?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's Tuesday.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The power of New York.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The power of New York.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The power of New York.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The power of New York.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The power of New York.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The power of New York.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The power of New York.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The power of New York.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The power of New York.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The power of New York.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The power of New York.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The power of New York.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The power of New York.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The power ofNew York.

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The power of New York.

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The power of New York.

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The power of New York.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The power of New York.

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The power of New York.

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The power of New York!

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The power of New York.

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The power of New York.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The power of New York.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The power of New York.

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The power of New York.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The power of New York.

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The power of New York.

35
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You know always for emergency work and one of those guys

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
like just leads it until the very end.

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's like it's okay that big crater in my jaw.

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We'll deal with that another time.

39
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So anyway, so now that we're kind of settled in

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and Patricia found a good dentist, it was time

41
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to start cleaning stuff.

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So yesterday, we kind of decided on...

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Patricia has a movie star smile, by the way.

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you've never seen her, Google Patricia Pi,

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
P-A-A-Y, and you'll see more than just a beautiful smile.

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Actually, depending on the results,

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you return from Google.

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it's all about symmetry and she's...

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She really deals with technicians and stuff

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
when it comes to her mouth.

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And so she's doing the same with me,

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
which is actually kind of cool because,

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you know, I'll have one of those million dollar smiles.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm already, you know, like 250,000, I guess.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I'm working my way up the chain.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So it's the daily source code for the next 40 minutes to give her take.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will be talking about stuff going on in podcasting.

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Of course, oh, by the way, I was going to say hit test.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I see that Michael Butler is online.

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So why don't we see if we can get a hold of him,

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
because I still have hit test number 22,

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
which I decided I'd do with him together,

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
which was a hit test.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've always had guitar solos.

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's just see if I can reach him.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It says Skype says that he's online.

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So let's see if we can get him on the wireless.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's see, it should be two...

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, man, it's really early in California.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like seven o'clock or something like that.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, maybe the computer is just on.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright, well, he'll see that I call.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hopefully he'll get to us if he is indeed awake.

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, stuff to talk about today.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, this is something I've been holding on to for a couple of men.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's might be even a couple of weeks.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
By DJ Rico, R-I-K-O.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Something called Whistler's Delight.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
22 tracks in this...

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's kind of a combination mash up mix.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It stands in a class by its own.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Seven minutes of Whistling mash up madness.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to give you some of the songs included in this.

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And you'll catch on pretty quickly when you hear the song.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Peter Gabriel, Bangles, walk like an Egyptian.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sweet George Brown, Centerfold.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You recognize some songs with Whistling in it.

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Bobby McFarron, don't worry.

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Be happy.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Actually, too bad.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I hate that song.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Otis Redding sitting on the dock of the bay.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Roger Miller.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's all in this song.

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's seven minutes so you can skip through it.

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But I guarantee you want to check it out.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Whistler's Delight.

Very huge riding there.

441
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The whisklers . The light .

442
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The full version DJ Rico .

443
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The daily source code .

444
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,840
interest after hearing it for the second time, but it's certainly something different.

445
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,440
I discovered something really interesting while that was playing. I had this hum in my microphone,

446
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,880
and of course I have all those great stuff right, and I've got all the right cables and all

447
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
the right gear, and all of a sudden this hum appears, and I thought it was something in the

448
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,440
mic cable or something with an insert cable, but I've discovered at least how to produce it

449
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
and how to get rid of it and now I have to figure out what it is. The microphone is now

450
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:19,840
directed pointed directly towards my mouth, and it's completely level. Now if I tilt the microphone

451
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,320
up and I'll turn up the mic here for a second, so maybe you'll realize that files out there

452
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,440
can help me. Listen to the, as I tilt it more towards the ceiling, the microphone, you'll hear how

453
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,040
the hum appears. Listen, see now it's pointed up, you can hear the hum, and now

454
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,840
I turn it down and the hum disappears. So what the hell is that all about?

455
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Can somebody please tell me? I was looking at the newspapers this morning. The UK is a real

456
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,280
big newspaper country. I really love all the, all the different newspapers you can pick up. It's

457
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,440
kind of like New York, you know, only instead of every corner where you combine newspapers,

458
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
you combine every shop, every gas station, everyone is selling papers, and there's all kinds

459
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,000
of different papers. And first of all, it's cool to see John Ren, a chairman of OmniCom

460
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,840
in the financial time, like almost the entire page. John is someone who made an investment through

461
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:26,960
OmniCom in our first company, which was Think New Ideas, and actually met him while I was

462
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,000
in New York, saw him again. What was in New York was the couple, wasn't that? Was it two weeks back,

463
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,400
three weeks back? And he totally, of course, understood podcasting was completely into it. And it was

464
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,760
very interesting article about how, you know, what the strategy is, and you know, basically OmniCom

465
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,920
has been secretly or secretly, quietly reorganizing, so they can really bring all of these combined

466
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,480
services under one roof to each client, you know, so that you have your television commercial

467
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,640
making, you have your planning, your media planning, where you're going to buy the commercials,

468
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:12,240
then you have your direct marketing, and what was the fourth one? Counting your money, I think,

469
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,160
was the fourth one. It was really interesting to see a big strategy change there for OmniCom.

470
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,000
And I think it's the right one because, you know, everyone knows that television advertising,

471
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,120
and certainly also radio advertising is not, you know, not as effective or cost effective as it

472
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,120
once was. So, big changes, and it's good to see the big big guns in there, working on it.

473
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,680
In the, in the times, so that's the London Times, there's this whole article, well, the headline

474
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:52,960
is Vatican plots against a Vinci code. And apparently, the Vatican is worried that people will start

475
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,360
to believe the blatant lies that are in the Vinci code. I got to tell you, I thought that

476
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,200
Vinci code was pretty damn convincing. In fact, I didn't read the book, I listened to it on

477
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,480
as an audio book, and it was really good. I recommend it. You can catch at audible.com. That's

478
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,400
where I buy my audio books. And I don't think I have it here. I would certainly let you hear a

479
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,440
piece of it, but they have, you know, good actors, good voices, good reading. But the Vatican is

480
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,400
really freaked out about this. And there's like, you know, there's 18 million copies in circulation,

481
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,080
44 languages, and just two years. And they're really going to do something about it. Not quite

482
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:42,800
sure what they're going to do. But already, books have come out like the Vinci Hokes and the truth

483
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,560
and fiction in the Vinci code. So interesting. I wonder if that stuff is in the US papers.

484
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,560
And I think it's already starting what I pretty much predicted would happen. We're going to see

485
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,480
the mainstream media now turning on the Michael Jackson's hand. And I've maintained that I cannot

486
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,600
believe that he's guilty of any of these charges. And I just don't see, I hear a lot of talk,

487
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,720
but I don't see a lot of evidence. I do see Michael Jackson getting slaughtered every single day

488
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,600
in the press, just everywhere. And it really is, even just the little things, you say, you know,

489
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:25,520
wacko jacko ha ha, boy, we didn't have a cute headline. I should hurt. So now it appears.

490
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,280
And this was, of course, page 33. It's not, it's no longer front page news. But of course,

491
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,960
it's the time. So I don't know if the time's actually writing anything front page about Michael Jackson.

492
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,480
But now it's turning out that none of these witnesses are credible. They're saying, oh yeah,

493
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,520
I lied at that point. No, I was lying there as well. You know, just completely no credibility.

494
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,200
Told us, Dean, Michael Jackson did not molest me. It's just, you know, the defensive, of course,

495
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,400
is tearing these kids to bits, which is also fucked up. You know, how can, how can all this happen?

496
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,760
It just seems so incredibly, you know, no matter what happens, Michael Jackson has damaged beyond

497
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,680
repair, as well, all the people involved in this, in this case. And God forbid, it turns out to be true.

498
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,560
Well, then, of course, I'll have to eat my words. But man, I got to tell you, I've met this guy

499
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,800
and I'll stand by my statement. I think he's asexual before he's anything else.

500
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,520
Yes, today, I talked about the mashups that I thought that they were kind of like, you know,

501
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,520
just stuff on the move and transition. And of course, Pimp Daddy said, got back to me on my comments.

502
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,320
I'm just trying to open it my outline here. Your comment about mashups of temporary is completely wrong,

503
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,720
Mr. Curry. It's the same with everything that's new and in reach for everybody. There's a lot of bullshit in the

504
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,320
beginning and really quality will survive. I'll never forget the feeling when I heard Beyonce versus Michael Jackson,

505
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,720
crazy in love and thriller, just you fork. If you don't know that one, here it is. So basically,

506
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,760
the Pimp Daddy is going to convince us that it is true that even if you go back to a mashup,

507
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,000
that, you know, you'll get the feeling just like you heard that song for the first time.

508
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,960
So let's all do the experiment together with thriller in love. Oh, man, that was like

509
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:27,520
not queued up. Very professional. Oh, yeah, I can see it. I'm really feeling good.

510
00:17:46,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

511
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,560
The fans became big enough, they like it's easy to see

515
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,860
Yes sir, I'm calm and you're the calm, my texture is the best bro

516
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,860
She's chillin' up, I've been chillin' up, I've been chillin' up, I've been chillin' up, I've got the name

517
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,860
Oh, I've been realin' to keep my words

518
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,860
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

519
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

520
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

521
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

522
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

523
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

524
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
I love you, raise your eyes

525
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,860
I love you, raise your eyes

526
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,060
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

527
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,160
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

528
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,360
Raise your eyes, I love you, raise your eyes

529
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,960
I love you, raise your eyes

530
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,160
You're on your left, you're on your right

531
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,560
You're on his right, and he's on his right

532
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,360
He's all dizzy, but I'm coming through the baby

533
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm dizzy, or I'll go

534
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Once he treat me,iegate, think it's your point

535
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,760
Young, then hurry

536
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,760
The darkness all across the land

537
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,760
A midnight hour is close ahead

538
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Creatures crawling south of the land

539
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,760
The terrorize all in the world

540
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,760
And who's ever shall we find

541
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Without the souls all getting down

542
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
My stand and face the harems of hell

543
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,760
And rock inside a corpse and shell

544
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Yes, some place to lay down

545
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I'll spread away

546
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Shoot me out

547
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Leave me alone

548
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Young

549
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
The foundest guarantee in the air

550
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,760
The funker 40,000 years

551
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,760
And grills and grills for every team

552
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
A clown's in need to see your doom

553
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
And though you found to stay alive

554
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Your body starts to shiver

555
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
For your own mortal can resist

556
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
The pain in your heart

557
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
And thus you're in love

558
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
What do you think of it?

559
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Hello?

560
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Oh, Patricia was standing right behind me

561
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
I had the speakers on for, she must have left

562
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
What do you think of that?

563
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
The mash-up

564
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
The mash-up

565
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
The what that I just played

566
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I turned around and I said, what did you think of that and you were gone

567
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Oh, I'm sorry

568
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Did you hear it?

569
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Okay, never mind

570
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I'll play later for you

571
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I was too sure

572
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Okay, I'm sorry

573
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Get off my show now

574
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Yeah

575
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Michael Jackson with

576
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
It's a crazy in love

577
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
What's my Beyonce?

578
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh, great

579
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
How's it?

580
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
How's it?

581
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Thank you

582
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll check your number in a second

583
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
Okay

584
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Oh, man

585
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Why don't we just try Michael Butler quickly

586
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
One more time

587
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
And then I'll move on with

588
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Some updates

589
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
See, what is that?

590
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
I'm like, now the phone is going like goodness

591
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
It's just a busy fucking day today

592
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Isn't it?

593
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
You can hear it vibrating

594
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
So we've got one incoming, one outbound

595
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,760
I don't think we're going to get a hold of Michael today

596
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Okay

597
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Anyway, got a lot of responses regarding podshow.com

598
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
A lot of people wondering

599
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
You know, what's going to happen

600
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Anticipating

601
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm hoping as I said to be able to make one or two announcements this week

602
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
But we're really going to be starting

603
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,760
First off with as I discussed in my previous podcast

604
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,760
With an investment in

605
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
In the content

606
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
In talent, really

607
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,760
And talent is not just people making podcasts

608
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
They're all the forms of talent who were out there in podcast

609
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
In the podcast community

610
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
We've also been talking to for a while

611
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
So that's where our first investment is going to go into

612
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Because we have a lot of

613
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Really interesting opportunities that

614
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
These first investments will be working with

615
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
You know, basically they can make money

616
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Doing what they already do

617
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
So these are highly motivated people who

618
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Already have built up an audience

619
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,760
And what's great about it is after our first phase

620
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
When we start working with

621
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
With our first talents

622
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Oh, that sounds like the internet that I would say

623
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
Our first talents

624
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
That's my Dutch coming through

625
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
You know, then you'll be able to join if you're interested

626
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,760
And again, this is what we're doing is commercial podcasting

627
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
You know, there's clearly a market for this

628
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
And anyone who wants to participate wants to make money

629
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Can make money

630
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
You know, that's the entire point

631
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
And you'll be able to participate with

632
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Success of some of these podcasters that we're working with

633
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
In the first stages

634
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,760
To be able to be a part of their success and to contribute to it

635
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
And believe me, the way it's going to work

636
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
The more you contribute, the more you can make

637
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
So it's very simple

638
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
And again, there's nothing that has to be done with

639
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Someone said, so what are you going to do about

640
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Advertisements? Well, you know, you tell me what's going to work

641
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
That's really the big question

642
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I believe what Howard Stern has done for years

643
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Just think if you've ever heard Howard Stern is

644
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Snapple commercials, I mean, that's an excellent way of

645
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Advertising in a podcast

646
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,760
But you may opt for some other way to do it

647
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,760
It's I think that we're going to be okay with that

648
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
And, you know, Bill boarding this program brought to you by

649
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Or this program was brought to you by that old works

650
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
You know, not everything has to change

651
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Not all the models are completely wrong

652
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,760
But you know, if you want to transport them over to this new world

653
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
But a lot of it is going to work

654
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
And we've got it teed up ready to go

655
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,760
So, you know, that's the first phase of what you're going to see

656
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,760
And at the same time, we want to enable

657
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Podcasting for much larger audience both on the creation side

658
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,760
But also on the listening side, that has to become easier

659
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,760
We want to introduce more audiences to podcasting

660
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,760
People who don't necessarily have an MP3 player

661
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
So there's all kinds of ways to do that

662
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
And that is the kind of stuff that you're going to be seeing

663
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Coming out in the next couple of weeks

664
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,760
As we start to unravel and unveil some of some of the plans

665
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm really, really, really, really excited about it

666
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Almost excited, by the way, as this email that came in

667
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Because, you know, I thought I had

668
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Really come up with the perfect idea of using two dishwashers

669
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Now, we already discussed that two dishwashers in your house

670
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Is a great idea because you basically just take the clean ones

671
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Out of one dishwasher when the dirty you put them back

672
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Into the dirty dishwasher and run the cycle

673
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,760
And you always have, you know, clean place at your disposal

674
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,760
And you don't have to keep taking them, you know, putting them into the

675
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Into the cupboards and taking them out is just one to the other

676
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
And then I thought that that was going to be it

677
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,760
Then John Hartnub sends me an email and says

678
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,760
The two dishwasher plan was not new to me

679
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,760
But as anyone described you, the logical extension of this plan

680
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Simple, you buy two houses next to each other with identical furnishings

681
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Live in one house until it's no longer habitable

682
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Then simply move next door while you're living in house number two

683
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Getting industrial cleaners to clean the dirty house

684
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,760
And have it ready for when you're ready to swap houses again

685
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,760
You know, when I'm rolling in all the hundreds of millions of

686
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Dollars from podshow.com, that's for all guests

687
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,760
That's for all guests

688
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Time for Adam Curry to take the Hiptus

689
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
With John Poelet

690
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Hi Adam, this is another hit this

691
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Just three simple in-throws and three answers

692
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
You know how it all works

693
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
I think we can handle this intro number one

694
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
One more time

695
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,760
One more time

696
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Let's clean all things

697
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
And this is number two

698
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,760
One more time

699
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
I want to say

700
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Sheera and the black devotion with Spacer

701
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Can I have that for five out?

702
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
And this is number three

703
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Oh no, it's not like that's the West Band or something

704
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,760
It sounds really cheese like a DX7

705
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
And these are the answer to answer number one

706
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Okay

707
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
It's strong with y'all from try

708
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Okay, scare me down with that

709
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Where the hell you're going now

710
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Where the hell you're going now

711
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Where the hell you're going now

712
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Come in

713
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
And answer number two

714
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Sheera and the black devotion

715
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,760
The song is titled Spacer

716
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
He's a ladies man

717
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Always with little kisses

718
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Got that one right in that

719
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
And answer number three

720
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,760
It's the time excursion for

721
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Oh, of course

722
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
This is rumours right

723
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm sure

724
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
I'll do it because you started

725
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Started by the jealous people

726
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,760
And they're in mess in something they had

727
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Somebody else is holding me

728
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Look at all these rumours

729
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
It's right on the every day

730
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
I just need some time

731
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Some time to get away

732
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
From all these rumours

733
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Yeah

734
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
And so number three

735
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
In today's hit test rumours

736
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760

Right on young, thank you very much

748
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Excellent

749
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,760
And I'm still waiting for a Michael Butler to

750
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Wake up

751
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Oh, second, what is this?

752
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
I thought I heard a Skype call

753
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Oh, it's not it's Ron Bloom

754
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
All right, let's talk to him

755
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Hey, Ron, you're on the daily source code

756
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Well, good morning at him

757
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Good morning, daily source code

758
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Listener

759
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
What are you? What time is it there in Miami?

760
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Miami is a

761
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Quarter past nine

762
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
We had a big emergency here in the city this morning

763
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Oh, what happened?

764
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Yeah, it was quite a big deal

765
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
A couple of us had to go outside

766
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
And determine whether it was necessary

767
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
To where longs leave shirts

768
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Ha ha ha ha ha

769
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Oh, man

770
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
You got the light

771
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
You got the light

772
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
It's a beauty step in the temperature

773
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Climate and we are indeed in

774
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
Short sleeve shirts

775
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
Oh, well hate you

776
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
We're in longs leave shirts here as well

777
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
All of those people who are listening from the

778
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Colden societies of the world

779
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah

780
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Back to visit

781
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
So what's up for today

782
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Buddy, what are we going to be doing

783
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Today we have a lot to do

784
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
We are kind of deluge with people

785
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
wondering about pod show

786
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
And how they can participate

787
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,760
and hopefully they can help make it better

788
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
So we're kind of getting into phase

789
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,960
of responding to the first group of people, you know, we have our little secret target group

790
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,800
that we're trying to kind of get involved first and then we have sort of our open target group.

791
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,800
You see audience how this ties in exactly with what I just said. Of course it does,

792
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,960
what the hell did you say? Something like that. It sounds really good only. Yeah,

793
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,160
keep going. I like it. You know, something else I was thinking about after listening to your

794
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,120
show yesterday was, you know, how important the directory, the personality of the

795
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,320
directory is, I've been looking around as everyone else has sort of these automated things

796
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,200
and just so excited to get ready to get to know our sort of our node managers and all these

797
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,120
people that are really, they're hidden superstars of content as the content makers and producers

798
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,720
start to proliferate the content editors, if you will, are really going to be the hidden superstars

799
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,920
of the genre and the secret producers who produce other talents. Right. Right.

800
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,640
Two groups very much like what happened that the good times in music and radio is when you

801
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,160
had great, you know, used to say in music business, what makes a great producer and they used

802
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,560
to say a great band. So by matching these great editors and producers to great talent,

803
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,320
I think we're going to see a whole new generation of fantastic podcasts. Poetry, man. That's just poetry.

804
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,400
Poetry and motion.

805
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:11,320
Slow motion. All right, I'm telling you. All right. I'm going to wind up the show. I'll

806
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,760
call you back later. All right. Thanks for putting me on. We're waiting for your first podcast,

807
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,720
you know. Well, I'm making a mission to update my weblog. So that that I did last night.

808
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,280
Really? Okay. What's the, what's the, what's the URL? Yeah, you're a genius. Oh, I'll

809
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:35,560
put a link to it. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. All right. All right. All right. I'll talk to you later.

810
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,200
Nice talk. All right. Take care. All right. And that's it for the daily source code, everybody.

811
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,960
Comments. Atomacteria.com will leave them on the weblog where you can find the show notes for today's

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:59,480
program. That's www.curry.com or we can go get the feed. It's daily source code.com.

813

814
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:17,880
Ron Skyping me. All right, everybody. Let's see, Friday going to London will definitely take

815
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:25,160
the eye river for that. Doing two interviews. One with a, a Dutch serious news program.

816
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,720
And the other one with BBC's Click Online. So I might as well do some sound seeing from the road.

817
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,760
Take everybody. Talk to you tomorrow. Bye. Bye.
