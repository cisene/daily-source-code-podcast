1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Daily source code, two, two, two, two,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
two thousand five transmitters.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We don't need no stinkin' transmitters.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Get ready for the generation of rockin' roll.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Fantastic! It's Adam Curry.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And it is Wednesday, officially,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
it's the second of February.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The power of New York, New York, New York.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Of course, yes, they are. I thought it was Wednesday, right?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, everybody, how you doing? Welcome to the hum day edition

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of the Daily Source Code.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, coming to you from the Curry Cottage, I'm alone once again.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No camera crews, no journalists, no damn, no nothing.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just you and me, I pod listener.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's your source code.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The power of New York, New York, New York, New York.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's the second of February, 2005,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
on the show today, some pod safe music.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Update of the Blue Man group.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Got some promos, including some of some pod safe music.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Talk about some technical things.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Like pod cast production consoles.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
An idea for a reality television show you can steal from me.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, and we have some trivia, yeah, that's right.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I missed it yesterday somehow, but Young Plet got a new trivia test

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
in there, so stay tuned for that.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All that and more, in the next 40 minutes on your Daily Source Code.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The power of New York, New York, New York, New York, New York.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Got a second, just take a stick here at the coffee.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hmm.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Actually, it wasn't completely prepared as I wanted to be.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Normally, I got my smoke here as well, but on the second, I made it.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I could just grab that for a moment, don't go away.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Actually, you can come up with me now.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Carry the mic.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You know what?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I needed a pair of wireless headphones.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's the last step of the podcast equipment that I'm looking for.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And he's a pair of wireless headphones.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're going to pair those send hisers.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Although, I think they're on IR and not on just a regular radio frequency

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
because I've got the wireless mics.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Actually, this is not the wireless mic.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's my sure mic, but I've got a really long cable.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So I can walk all over the place, but then I can't hear the music.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't hear the mix or I actually need like a.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, maybe I just make my, my, my power book portable.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Maybe I had some kind of straps like later hosin.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Suspenders.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I go walk around with it.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So I'll have the microphone and the headphones with me at all times.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey, it could happen.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So for the past, what is it now?

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is it almost two weeks that we've been playing different versions of you don't own me?

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let me see what we've had so far.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We've had the bitties, of course, list of these bitties.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We've had Leslie Gore.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We've had Rasputin out.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yesterday, we had a shoot.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What was the name of that?

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I should get yesterday's show notes up here.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hold on a second.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I haven't had them close by.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's 120 in the afternoon, by the way.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Just so you know, it doesn't really matter because you may be listening to this in the morning.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You may be listening to this in the afternoon or in the evening.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me see.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, here it is.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You don't owe me.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, there was by.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, clouds, no me.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And Michael Butler.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We all know and love him from the Rock and World Geek Show.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It sent me, and actually it's kind of cool because it's cool when you see a familiar name

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
show up in the in the Gmail account that I'm using for MP3 files.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's MP3 feedback at gmail.com.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Michael Butler from the Rock and World Geek Show sent me a Joan jet in the black hearts version, which is kick ass.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You don't owe me on the source code.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't owe me.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not just one of your many toys.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You don't owe me.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't say I can't go with other goals.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And go tell me what you want.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't tell me what you say.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And please, what I don't want with you.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't want me on this way.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't owe me.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't try to change me in any way.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You don't owe me.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't tell me damn cause I'll never stay.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000

Don't tell me what you want.

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just say you can't go with other goals.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And go tell me what you want.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000

Don't tell me what you want.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I remember the big San Francisco earthquake earthquake.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right here at that birds singing outside.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
See what God is playing outside.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's very day when the earthquake took place.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Patricia was actually doing some backing vocals on Johnny's album.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Was that an emergency moment on the wall here?

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Or was it up your alley?

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Which wasn't an huge success,

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,800
thing. Well, that's relative, right? I have a platinum album on the wall for a million

157
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:49,480
sold. I guess it was pretty good. But so Steve said that you know everything's going great

158
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,880
with him and it was fun to talk to Steve because as we found out he is actually doing some

159
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,800
consulting now for a serious satellite radio and so of course I got to dig in and ask him

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,240
some questions. Some of which I can't talk about because I promised I wouldn't because you know

161
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,120
hey he has some kind of confidentiality confidentiality going on there. But I can't tell you

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,560
have you talked to Stern because he certainly went back in the day when I was at MTV he would

163
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,440
talk to Howard Stern a frequently. He says yeah I want him two times but he mainly talks with Gary

164
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,720
Delabate. Better known as it. Baba Bowie. And I said oh man we need to get Stern in on this podcast

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,880
and he said now he'll never do it because he just won't give it away for free. I think the words

166
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,080
were he's a commercial fucker. I can't blame him I guess. But something interesting Steve

167
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,720
did tell me because we were talking about well first I said hey dude did you put that deal together

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,800
with Nina Blackwood Allen Hunter and Mark Goodman on like the 70s and 80s. Now the 80s channel

169
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,440
on serious and he said no actually that that deal had already been put to bed before he got there

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,400
but I said yeah so what are their channels or are expected he says well no channels because

171
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:07,160
basically we're out of bandwidth. I was like whoa that's interesting. In fact it's gotten so here's

172
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,000
how it works the government has apparently allocated by the FCC then has allocated x amount of

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,120
spectrum there's that word which means you know frequencies in the air that you can't see touch

174
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,080
taste or feel or hear for that reason not without a receiver and they yeah that's like bandwidth

175
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,640
it's like you know so you have x number of megabits per second to use in fact I think it is

176
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:37,640
measured in megabits per second satellite bandwidth. Excuse me and they filled it up so they

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,120
had really they don't have any more channels left in fact to make more room the all talk channels

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,600
are now being broadcast in mono so even though it's really cool and they have quite a future ahead

179
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,200
of them it's interesting because they can't really add more channels whereas in podcasting hey

180
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,080
we don't need those stinking trans meters. So that's good to talk this Steve and look forward to

181
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,040
hooking up with him in New York hopefully I'll see him because I'm trying to get to New York around

182
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:14,680
the 16th or at least for the for the Bitties cast launch on the 16th in in Wave I Yorker and

183
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,400
oh yeah one other thing Steve said he was doing or he had he had done some some work at Virgin

184
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,080
Records and of course then then you say oh so what talent were you working with he said oh

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,840
Courtney love I said oh dude that's a podcast he said you bitch yeah so he's gonna tell us all about

186
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,720
the nightmares he had with Courtney love if I get a hold of him in New York in the next couple of

187
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,320
played the blue man group a couple days for you with that awesome version of I feel love

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,600
got an email about that from Sebastian Adam greetings for Germany let me tell you about the podcast

189
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,160
but wow what do you say here um okay it was on the 31st right you played a track from the blue man group

190
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,400
with vocals from Venus hum that track is actually from the complex rock tour live

191
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,840
it's a DVD he provides a URL so you can get that link from the show notes for today an awesome DVD

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,320
music on it is awesome it's not the normal show or the program that you see in Las Vegas but

193
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,760
it's a special rock tour which the blue man group did and it apparently well the theater program kicks

194
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,400
ass but he says that the DVD is something you have to see the the rock show was perhaps even a

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,240
little bit better so I guess we still need to go to Vegas and check that out because man that has that

196
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:41,320
track kick but that's where I belong hold on let me hear that okay okay

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,160
tape for all that and only all high where we go all the world why well oh dude start over making

198
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:59,160
sure the net never gets predictable it's a modify it was a sound you tried out the new

199
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,800
MSN search pretty interesting something really irritating that I found about the MSN search is

200
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,040
when you when you live in a like in any country it basically searches under your country first

201
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,840
which because Dave Warner said that he was the number one Dave on on the new search and had the

202
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,800
number one RSS result and I and I clicked on the links that he provided and I got whole different

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,720
results like whoa but then I noticed that no matter what I did I tried forcing the dot com you know

204
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,000
as search dot MSN dot com and it kept going to dot code dot UK and yeah you can change it to

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,400
the location to be the United States but I really want to be able to search the whole internet or

206
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:51,320
all the internet as our president would say and I finally got a tip from Simon Simon's bait

207
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:59,240
spiked something like that Simon who gave me the URL which you need to use it's well it's in the

208
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,120
show notes search dot MSN dot com then it's like slash question mark no reader it equals one

209
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,720
you just have to copy that from the show notes but essentially what it does is it lets you search

210
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,840
the whole internet at the same time it sets your cookie so the next time you go to search dot

211
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,800
MSN dot com it won't just redirect you to your own country version so that's something that I

212
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,360
consider a bug really I mean why what I only I like the idea that you can say search locally

213
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,440
because that is a button on the MSN search page but the default search should be the entire

214
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,120
internet I mean there's there's absolutely no reason why I should whether default should go to the

215
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,680
country that you're in so that's a solid guess hey I'm just a quick dot here I know

216
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:52,040
one of your shows you were talking about having mp3 devices kind of like Linux on the iPod

217
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,240
just have it display your show notes and one of the things I just wanted to make a comment what some

218
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:05,640
newer mp3 players out of the box automatically support the displaying of song lyrics and those are

219
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,680
just notes encoded with a timestamp and well it's not exactly the kind of thing you're looking for

220
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,520
it might be a good first step to putting show notes that synchronize with the mp3 playback at a certain

221
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,720
time you can have the show notes appear on the display of the mp3 device and I'll include a copy

222
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,160
of that so you can see what the format of that is like but it's just an interesting side development

223
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,600
just something I noticed some of the new portable mp3 players that are coming out in the market

224
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,400
take care love the show yeah dude thank you very much I think this is actually really exciting I

225
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,400
for the past couple of weeks I don't know if anyone noticed that at all but if you look at the

226
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,320
daily source code file if you look at the ID3 tags I have been pasting the show notes into the

227
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,000
lyrics field so of course that's not doing anything because apparently there's some special type

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,520
of encoding that you need to use for the lyrics file but if I understand this correctly then there are

229
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:10,120
some mp3 players that understand this particular file format and I don't know if it has to be

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,120
encoded in the ID3 tags or if it's a separate file that needs to be picked up but apparently there's

231
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,360
some kind of synchronizing that you can do so that if you say okay I want this particular lyric

232
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,200
to show up at this particular time code that it will show up in the display of the mp3 player so

233
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,760
this could be really interesting the email that that he sent me was so long I didn't post that

234
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,840
into the show notes I'm looking for links looking looking for pointers looking for people who are

235
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,560
experimenting with this because it's could be extremely cool and the question of course is does

236
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,280
this work with the iPod does it work with the iRiver I mean I know nothing about this this is

237
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,960
pretty new to me so let's work on this and see if we can figure out what what these lyrics are

238
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:01,080
if we can use lyrics or use show notes in lieu of lyrics in our podcast very cool appreciate the

239
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:09,880
feedback promise that update you on my progress with windows as I of course installed that for

240
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,760
Christina downstairs so yesterday and by the way I love the fact that that I've installed windows

241
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,320
for her because I'm pretty much the and I'm sure most people know this is like you know if if you

242
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,120
know anything about computers and the increments then you pretty much become the default go to

243
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,320
guy for your friends and family and whenever the computer's not working you know which can range from

244
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:38,600
it's not plugged into something very complex you get the call right and sometimes it's sometimes

245
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,200
it's like trying to help the flight attendant land the 747 from the control tower especially if

246
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,560
you're helping people troubleshoot over the phone and I told Christina I said look the support I

247
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,160
give you on fixing your computer issues is going to be less because I don't know very much about

248
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,000
windows and quite honestly a lot of windows shit is mystery to me so she had a problem she has a

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,520
vanilla site the land of the young and the hopeless dot com which is her good Charlotte

250
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:17,240
vanilla site and vanilla site of course is it's a great weblog tool only it does want to see

251
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,680
the refer coming from your browser and I've seen this error before and I thought it was usually

252
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,400
something that had to be fixed inside vanilla itself when it says who couldn't find a refer or

253
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,280
couldn't match the refer whatever it is so we can't post or we can't edit this particular page

254
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,240
that you requested so I'm like oh man it's of course she comes to me and she says oh it's not working

255
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,800
can't update and so the first thing I say is well it's windows so you know there you go I don't know

256
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,200
if I can help you but it's pretty proud of myself because I figured it out first I copied and pasted

257
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,560
the actual error message into Google I should try pasting it into MSN search actually see what comes

258
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,680
up there and of course it turns out or one of the one of the results that I got was from a

259
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,480
usual and hosted site that says well basically your browser is not passing off the refer information

260
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,320
and it had a link down there to something called norton internet security which I had seen

261
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,440
automatically installed when I when I installed the whole computer for her and indeed there is a

262
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,920
security setting it's very down pretty deep it was very confusing to find but there's a browser

263
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,480
security setting which doesn't really tell you what it does or doesn't send but apparently it's

264
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,240
not going to be sending the refer so I unselected that and lo and behold it started working so

265
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,040
well very cool I got to tell you man windows it's still a deep fucking hole

266
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,600
I had on my name's christian stout and I just want to leave you a comment on your

267
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,440
two most recent podcasts good to hear that you moved over to the windows world it's nice to

268
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:57,640
see a hardcore Mac fan enjoy the the the thrills of windows of course yes indeed christian thrilling

269
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,320
it is we all know that the Mac was built on better architecture really we want to tell people

270
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,240
that will be about the hard drive you might want to actually go into system tools oh this is a

271
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,200
me talking about the the windows hard drive making such a freaking ride to start programs accessories

272
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,760
and bring up the disc defragment her and run that it might quiet it down a little bit

273
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,080
also I'd go to windows update dot microsoft dot com yeah i did that do the update if you haven't

274
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,880
now it it it it came through automatically you know get these pop up saying you have to download

275
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,920
18 megabytes of stuff to update so make sure you turn on your automatic update yeah it's a

276
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,120
you know I didn't hear about the section of your podcast where it was skipping but I do I did catch

277
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,920
the comment about from the person about running off the dual hard drives okay just to make clear

278
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:51,560
now this is going back to the Mac where I was having problems playing back huge AIFF files

279
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,880
and recording a new one at the same time on the same disc suggestion came in to record the podcast

280
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,120
on an external drive for instance fire wire and use everything else off of the internal drive

281
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,240
that could work um you probably don't have to if you've got a powerful enough system but you need

282
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,520
to consider how hard drives work and that when you're reading a file it's in one location when

283
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,120
you're writing it it's in another location even though drive spin fast and access time is pretty fast

284
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,680
nowadays you're still having to look at how big your files were and you're probably moving

285
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,840
working that little hard drive you know head really hard bouncing all over the places it's trying

286
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,080
to do two things it wants right you probably you could maybe fix some things by increasing your ram

287
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,920
I'm not sure what your broadcasting off of but it would not hurt to double that if it's only

288
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,760
like a gaker so that would definitely give you more available ram to pull in files as well as store

289
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,280
your files before you even write them. Additionally you could probably go into the program you're

290
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,800
using and bump up the ram that it uses so I'll try that or you could just I don't think

291
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,160
that actually works can you do that on OS OS X now on OS 10 sorry is that possible keep the files

292
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,640
smaller and not try to read and by the way I like saying OS X lots of people send me comments and

293
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,840
say it's OS 10 not OS X OS 9 was the operating system before but it's OS X it's easier it's nicer

294
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:24,360
sexier OS X and a 600 meg file lastly in the mind the magazines I was reading I get a bunch

295
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,760
every week you know information overload sucks anyways it's called TV technology this is the February

296
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,560
second issue in 2005 and on page 28 of Frank Beach and talks about podcasting and you know you're

297
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,040
in the news everywhere and I didn't know if you knew about this one but there might be some of your

298
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,680
listeners that read this magazine and if they don't they might want to pick it up it talks about

299
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,320
everything we've called heard about as well as the video feature possible of this and who knows

300
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,400
where else casting might go anyway I enjoy your podcast and just want to let you know now that you are

301
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,040
in the windows world I definitely asked that you give my podcast to listen it's something I added to

302
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,880
a website I've been running for a little bit that deals with the home network hopefully one day soon

303
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,280
I'll get my Mac many and I'll be able to start supporting Macs but it talks about everything

304
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,240
that's going to deal with your home network and environment and how to keep yourself secure

305
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,280
manage it etc it's called home network help dot info all right and I would really like you to

306
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,600
give it a listen and give me some of your great feedback I will do thank you very much Chris and

307
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,880
appreciate the technical info there I understood just about every single bit of it a little bit

308
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,240
of confusion there because I'm still recording the podcast on the on the Mac side but I'm

309
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,200
exploring windows exploring when you hear me talk about buying a windows laptop that's when you

310
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:55,880
really got to get worried oh yes hello Adam Curry hello and the listeners of the daily source

311
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,440
code hello this is Michael Randall here from Cambridge podcast Cambridge podcast dot log spot dot

312
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,960
com you know it was only last week I was sitting in the drawing room and wondering is there a

313
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,800
way to help music in this university town this historic little aisle of ours and I think there is

314
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,320
I think there is now with the Cambridge podcast our aim is to play the best and independent music

315
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,360
that hasn't been heard before that hasn't been given a chance to be played and I think we've done

316
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,560
and if you want to support us why not come on down hey haha yes I thought say at Cambridge podcast

317
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,880
dot log spot dot com but not always this is eccentric most of the time we just play some

318
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,440
darn good tunes and I hope you enjoy the show and at Cambridge podcast I don't miss a little

319
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,640
shoot thank you very much so this is the podcast that is doing a podcast about local bands

320
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,560
local to the school in this case Cambridge University and in their show notes they provide not only

321
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,840
links to the songs but also where the bands are performing in the neighborhood so it's a very

322
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,960
geographic community based type of podcast and send me a couple samples this is one of my

323
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:11,400
liked bad well ash it's take as heard on the Cambridge podcast and today on the daily source code

324
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:38,360
the last time that I can switch my mind to you always put a scene of my high you

325
00:25:51,560 --> 00:26:09,560
the bottom of my brain it is burning from what am I just know the trees this year my

326
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:20,120
I run a lot that I must not see and I just want to take take it home I want to drag it home

327
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:49,400
and when was that time I tell you and when was the last time that I can I touch my

328
00:26:49,400 --> 00:27:02,680
mind for you always but I can't see enough behind you

329
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:14,600
but once you're my brain it is burning from what am I just know what am I just not

330
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:28,760
I wish you for this time but I just don't wish for me and I just want to take take take it home

331
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:48,680
bad well ash take on your daily source code once again that came from the

332
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:58,360
Cambridge podcast let me see oh yeah he's what I want to talk about audio hijack pro if you're

333
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,520
a Mac user and you're in the podcast that you've probably noticed me talking about this before

334
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,200
this is the program that I actually use to record my podcast and I think we've talked about

335
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:15,320
the setup a couple times before what the way I'm using audio hijack pro by the way is not exactly

336
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,120
the way the makers of the program intended it and I've been you know trying to get some attention

337
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,920
for a long time actually had an email conversation a couple months ago with one of the guys

338
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,640
from audio hijack pro it's only four guys I think and I saw blog post yesterday which I pointed

339
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,560
to from curry dot com where Quentin one of the founders says hey you know what do we need to do

340
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:44,920
to make this software better for podcasts and just looking at you know what they really intend

341
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,320
they're software to do I can kind of understand what the confusion is coming from because what

342
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:56,920
their marketing audio hijack pro mainly for is that you can record audio from any application which is

343
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,400
of course where the name comes from audio hijack pro and you can also set them up on timers

344
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:11,480
so you could basically say please start up my real player and fire up a URL which could be an

345
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:18,920
NPR program if you will and record that either you know this day or every every time weekdays

346
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,240
and you can set all these recording schedules up is pretty sophisticated and of course that is very

347
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,320
much like an iPodder only it's a functionality of an iPodder but not really doing it the same way

348
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:39,080
nor is it actually grabbing MP3 files oh not just got a Skype request from Michael Butler of course

349
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:48,040
approve you dude you crazy there you go you know so but that would be like kind of like an iPodder

350
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:54,520
for existing existing radio streams or if there's some other application you wanted to hijack the

351
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:01,800
audio from at a set time the way I've been using it is is almost backwards what I've been doing is

352
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:09,000
I've been hijacking my audio input and running that through all their great filters and plug-in

353
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,480
et cetera and adding to that just basic you know sound out from from my Mac there's a couple of

354
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,200
reasons and it's it's actually two technical to go into in a verbal explanation I think a couple

355
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,400
of reasons why it's not really easy to use and a couple why it is very easy to use but I man I'm

356
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,280
really looking forward to a dialogue with these guys and I don't know maybe we have to just draw

357
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,480
diagrams and stuff to explain what we need but essentially they've got all the bits in there you know

358
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,960
what records that does your ID three tags you can plug in audio the only thing that's a problem

359
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,120
is well actually I'm using it backwards let me let me try and explain so typically let's say you play

360
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,280
everything like your sweepers and your jingles and if you play any other audio except a microphone

361
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,120
then you let's say I use quick time to play that so you would hijack quick time right and then

362
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:08,360
this is voiceover plug-in which actually lets you add and add in a microphone that's why it's

363
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,400
called voiceover and it can even do what they call auto ducking so if you start to talk it'll

364
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,480
bring down the music automatically if you stop talking to bring it up again automatically

365
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,600
I've tried this several times and it really works very well except it doesn't work

366
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,680
and the program will not hijack audio if there's not an actual audio stream coming out of

367
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:37,400
the application you've hijacked so let me try and explain so if I'm hijacking quick time it will

368
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,040
it will only actually record if there's audio coming out of quick time I've tried this before and the

369
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,960
solution that came up with was to have like a really long track running on a loop that had just a

370
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,560
little bit of noise barely audible but just enough to kick audio hijack pro into record mode

371
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:04,520
so actually that work pretty well but you know if actually every single time the loop would restart

372
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:10,520
then the recording would just stop for like a miller second and it would throw off the latency

373
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:18,040
and it'd become really complicated oh it's actually a phone call I gotta take tell you what

374
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:25,560
hold on a sec how much do you hate that huh sorry that was the bank I just got yeah you

375
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,080
don't want to hear my conversation well you do want to hear my kind of conversation with the bank

376
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,680
probably but you're not gunna okay that's just the way it is uh let's see we're back at audio hijack

377
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,560
pro I don't know where the where the hell I was I guess I kind of explained it but anyway

378
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,400
I think there's a big disconnect between what the podcasters are looking for at least the

379
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,480
ones that are using a Macintosh and what audio hijack pro is doing because they are almost an

380
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,520
iPod or client as I explained where really we want to use their stuff as a production console so

381
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,800
I'm going to keep working on that and it's just a we need a better way to describe it and I don't know

382
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,880
if I can do that in in written words and maybe someone can help out let's see if we can get together

383
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,400
with these guys quite and certainly seems to to be interested in getting stuff going and I love

384
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,800
this company I love their products so let's see if we can work something out just a quick thing I

385
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:26,520
want to mention I noticed this the other day I'm a I'm a horrible typist and I wonder I know

386
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:34,440
in the states usually typing lessons are a part of grade school I don't know if it's extra

387
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:46,120
curricular activity or and what have you but I never had typing lessons I'd just kind of taught

388
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,600
myself then I type with I don't know one just maybe five fingers four and a half fingers something

389
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,640
like that but I have to look at the keyboard so I'm I guess I'm not I can't blind type and I was

390
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,000
wondering if anyone else you know has this and if there's a way to transition off of looking

391
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,400
I mean I can do it if I type I pretty much know where all the keys are and I do pretty well I still

392
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:16,520
have to glance down but you know I am just not a blind typist and if you have any is there of course

393
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:22,760
that you know that can unlearn all these horrible you know typing methods that I have which of course

394
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,320
are you know the shit it's no good let's see if if we can if we can improve that and let me

395
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,560
know what kind of type you are you like a hunt and you know peck and peck and hit type of person

396
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,200
or are you a complete blind typist you know I don't necessarily want to go through some computer

397
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,760
program that's going to take me back to square one is there a shortcut to get from pecking

398
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,200
at the keyboard but using you know really being able to to go pretty quickly it's just that I

399
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,200
can't look at the screen at the same time anyway you get the idea so let me know what you find

400
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,400
out okay

401
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,800
huh I'm y'all pull it here with yet another hit test it's good time so I could not reach

402
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,440
just making another one for you know it works your tracks lined up for you and here is number one

that's the song you got to play in the car when you're sleeping

424

cool very very cool thank you you and I love your hit test and I think

453
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,520
actually um did I miss one yesterday or did I play it

454
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,600
or let me see I have a hit test number two I thought I played this one maybe I

455
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,360
didn't let's if if I played this one well let's see what it is let me

456
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,760
let me just

457
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,520
one girl in casting with Adam

458
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,280
hey Adam this is a young boy with this week's hit test again three

fit club here in the UK which is a weight loss reality show

464
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,560
it's really quite good actually um uh it's just one of those shows that's kind of

465
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,360
addictive to watch and you know they go through uh exercise and eating but

466
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,680
also um there's some psychological aspects to it and there's some

467
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,360
regression uh hypnotic therapy whatever and I was

468
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,000
watching it last night and I said the Patricia said you know what's coming next

469
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,200
what is unavoidable uh it's going to be the celebrity stop smoking show

470
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,640
and I think it actually would be a very good reality based show I mean we say

471
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,920
reality but of course television has no right anymore to the use of word

472
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,080
reality um but I think it would be cool imagine having you know a couple of

473
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,400
celebs and you follow them around and you know of course you want to try and

474
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,080
catch them sneak into smoke and you got to have all kinds of test built in you know

475
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,520
where I also get a pop quiz and we have to smell your breath and

476
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,240
I don't know if there's other ways to check if someone's been smoking you know

477
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,680
nicotine check basically but that could be really cool just to watch how people

478
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,240
go fucking crazy when they can't smoke so it's a free idea go ahead use it

479
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,080
abuse it it's about to happen and besides uh it probably being something

480
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,640
a lot of people would watch um uh you could probably get it subsidized by the

481
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,600
government uh just a thought finally for today's source code is we're just a little bit

482
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,640
over a 40 40 minute mark I'm gonna play one more song for you um I was introduced to

483
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,960
a group called Clare Fader and the Vaude villains by uh Leon from the from the

484
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,160
the city's bitties um and I've been listening to a couple of their tunes of course the site

486
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,120

487
