1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Delta Sierra Charlie, 236

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
There are no secrets!

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,600
Holy information you don't yet have!

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,200
And I'm Korean!

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,600
With $16 million worth of airplane strapped my ass!

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,720
Transmidders?

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,440
In the next generation radio content in my ears!

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,400
We don't need no thinking, can't we?

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
I like to think I'm flying into the future!

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,480
Fantastic!

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,920
It's a battle curry!

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
And coming to you from New York, it's the daily source code for September 6!

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,120
I am, uh, well, first of all apologies. The show is late.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,040
Uh, that has a number of reasons.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,520
Uh, I really had planned on doing it last night.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,880
Uh, mainly because the upload here at the wonderful Essex house sucks so bad at swallows!

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,200
A little ode to Christine for that one.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,360
Yeah, I've got like a perfect mega bit download speed, but for some reason, uh, well,

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,160
I guess most people only need to download really, uh, in hotel configurations.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
So for some reason, the upload speed, I'm getting about, you know, like,

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,160
analog modem speeds.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,200
I wanted to have it uploaded during the night. So it's, uh, that was yesterday.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,480
It doesn't seem like the, uh, connectivity has gotten any better.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,120
So I guess this will be the daily source code for Tuesday, and for Wednesday,

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,360
depending on what part of the globe you reside.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,200
I could tell you, I'm so happy.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,280
I brought the Yamaha Professional Audio Working Station AW-16G and it's performing

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,000
Just it's fantastic. It's really outstanding. I've done let's see one, two, three, four

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,440
days worth of serious satellite radio recordings. Did I'm all here in my room? I've got

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,920
the new microphone with me. Everything, you know, not Godhood is gone well and arrived

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,480
perfectly because it was just packed in the suitcase wrapped in a in a dog blanket, which

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:19,960
is great protection. I'll tell you about what's been going on today and what I've

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,960
been up to, but I have to say it's very, I find it very hard to get into a really upbeat

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,600
and happy mood with everything that's going on with the Gulf Coast and Hurricane Katrina.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,200
And even Agro 1 is affected. Check out his mashup to race funds for Katrina relief.

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:57,840
Just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:22,520
And just don't know, just don't know, just don't know.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't

just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't know, just don't...

43
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,740
I wanna be with you, believe in me

44
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,260
Can you run away on the sixth night?

45
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,620
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

46
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,180
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

47
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,180
I wanna be with you, I wanna be with you

48
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,140
I wanna be with you, believe in me

49
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,580
Can you run away on the sixth night?

50
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,780
I wanna be with you, I wanna be you

51
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,100
The only one that I brighter

52
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,500
I wanna survive right

53
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,140
Oh, I am

54
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,520
I wanna be with you, yeah

55
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,500
I wanna be with you

56
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,900
For my own sake, for my sake

57
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,420
Boil fire

58
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:36,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

59
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,160
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

60
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:59,800
Well it's a bundley clear that Agro 1 is affected as well.

61
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,800
In the ID3 tags of this mashup to raise funds for Katrina Relief, it even says that and

62
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,800
also begs you to visit www.redcross.org.

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,520
Actually I'm glad that I have a little break here because I want to start up the file transfer

64
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,640
P-dub is in Tampa, Florida and he's waiting for some more pod show stuff to come his way

65
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,240
so he can complete the production of that and I'm really if you listen he can probably

66
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,640
hear my G4 hole and I'll put the mic next to it.

67
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,800
That is the unmistakable sound of the fan in high gear because it's doing a lot of work.

68
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,320
I just want to maybe I should tell you a little bit about this while I'm doing this

69
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,840
transfer the setup that I've got running here.

70
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm very pleased with myself because exactly what I wanted.

71
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,120
I wanted to just be able to kind of unplug, like 8 or 10 plugs really and just throw this

72
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,840
thing in my suitcase and take along my power book which I do anyway.

73
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,600
This is actually a pretty long migration path because I had a pretty static setup at the

74
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,360
cottage and that means that I had an external drive with all my promos and mashups and

75
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,960
pod safe music which by the way is a mirror of everything that Tepito has in Tampa.

76
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,920
Until this point because we are in the process of hiring someone for this job he's taking

77
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,720
all the submissions categorizing them putting them into our database and then he's compiling

78
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,240
the shows.

79
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I had a mirror of that on a relatively big external hard drive with an external power

80
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
supply.

81
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,040
The first thing that has a copied everything over to that fire light 100 gigabyte drive

82
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,320
that I got at the Apple Store which is no bigger than shit man.

83
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,040
It's smaller than my phone really and it packs 100 gigs and so first I made a copy of that

84
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,920
then I had to adjust our database so the database was aware of the new location of the

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,040
files so I did all of that hold on I'm just dropping this into the appropriate folder here.

86
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,080
Let me say with the upload speed is as a Julia okay so I have my FTP program open I use

87
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,800
transmit by the way on on the Mac I really like it so now it's just sitting here saying

88
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:24,240
idle it's not even putting it I connected to the server okay I drag the two folders over

89
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
and okay we'll see if that kicks in in a second.

90
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:38,600
Then on the hardware side I have everything running through an M box interface so I can also

91
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,840
hook up the workstation to control MIDI slider faders on my second machine at home.

92
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:53,280
So basically now what I've done is I've just using analog inputs and outputs for the

93
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,320
G4 using the speaker output and the line input and those are coming out of the mixer.

94
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,080
There's one other piece of gear that I use at home which you may be able to tell the

95
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,960
difference I can definitely tell the difference it's the stereo valve processor and I route

96
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,280
that you know route the signal through that back into the mixer before it goes into the

97
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,440
into the actual recording and so I've just patched those two with two little short those two

98
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,560
channels to each other with two short patch cables and then in the workstation itself I set up

99
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,640
a compressor limiter and I'm pretty happy with the outcome now at the hell so it looks

100
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,240
what let me just see what happened here okay did it disconnect is that what happened oh man

101
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,720
my Mac is freaking out you know when you deal with really big files okay here we go connecting

102
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,440
so that worked that worked okay it's definitely connecting now let me just drag one foot maybe

103
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,960
doesn't like me dragging two folders over okay creating a new folder oh there we go okay

104
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,600
what's the upload speed this'll kill you so far we've transferred 32 kilobytes

105
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:11,720
oh it's a whopping 2.2 oh it's gone up to six almost it's stupid 7.3 kilob is a kilobit

106
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:19,960
I wonder it's a capital b's it would be kilobytes hmm I don't know who the hell knows it's slow

107
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,760
it's I'm moving very fast at all okay so anyway so I got everything set up here in the hotel room

108
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,280
as I said I got a nice one of the dogs blankets I used that to to wrap up the the workstation

109
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,240
put my diddy bag is that what you call it by the way your your toiletry bag I call the diddy bag

110
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,560
and that kind of you know I was used as a spacer so this so the mixer board was was pretty much safe

111
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,080
very very very pleased with how things go I you know maybe it was just and by the way the

112
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,120
flight once again I you got a love you got a love uh virgin and you know I pay a regular full

113
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,160
price for flying I'm getting things for free but it's it's such a it's such a groovy service it really

114
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,560
is and this time around I got a letter from Sir Richard Branson stuck in in one of the

115
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,040
inflight magazines I guess they do that once every so full trips and he so of course everyone

116
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,960
up her class got the letter but it was it was you know high quality bomb paper and it said

117
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,680
Sir Richard Branson and so I hope you're enjoying your flight and you know just drop me an email

118
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,360
give it give out his email address and he said I will personally respond to it so I'm gonna send him

119
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,840
an email and tell him how much I love the service and and I'll think if there's any improvements

120
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:45,640
I'll send that along to him so got in last night wasn't very hungry of course time differences

121
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,560
have me a little bit messed up cut some serious shows actually prep the show for today and and

122
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,640
I was like you know then I just got all wobbly I saw like the David Letterman's monologue and I

123
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,360
knew that I got an email from from Cindy from the Kenan Squip show she said that she actually invited

124
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,280
me to dinner but I would I even got you to late to have the dinner she said that Aaron from

125
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,920
Parkney of Bitterman's circle was in town because Weezer was performing on Letterman and they're

126
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,040
gonna have a late dinner and so I didn't even I didn't get to have dinner didn't even get to see Weezer

127
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,800
so and in this morning I got it bright and early work time presentation I had a couple meetings today

128
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,880
the most important one was at four o'clock it's all advertising agencies and they're all over the

129
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,440
stuff and they're coming in and and the consistently what I've heard this is this is I'm really

130
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,560
loving this news what I've heard consistently from the advertising community in New York and we're

131
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,560
up and down Madison Avenue and of course you know we were there 11 years ago when we were

132
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,760
hawking this thing called what was it oh yeah the internet that's right so we've got a lot of

133
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:04,360
friendly faces this time around um the consistently they're saying um our advertisers the you know

134
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,960
the clients of these agencies our advertisers and I think that the agencies also mean themselves

135
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,840

cotton nice fade cotton does the kind of theme song podcast which is not always that regular

160
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,360
but sometimes she has it hits it once a week every single week usually on sunday saturday

161
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,680
as a sunday's over the weekend I love putting that that podcast on you know sometimes last

162
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,960
about an hour and it's a great music and it's all in a certain theme and she is an English teacher

163
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,120
I believe in the Netherlands and you know I was listening and you know despite the the somber tone

164
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,920
of the message that she was sending she's got a real sexy voice so being here in the states of

165
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:26,040
course inundated with media about hurricane Katrina I love to turn on the TV and see what what I'm

166
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:35,480
not missing when it comes to the way the media well just a television general and you know so

167
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,560
then they're all on the same trip of this couple that the god married and one of the

168
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,560
one of the evacuees shelters then it's just you know it comes in waves of what they're

169
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,800
reporting on and really the cameras can pull back wide enough to show the devastation you know

170
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,840
and if anything and there's a lot of finger pointing and blaming and you know and what should we do

171
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,800
and you know why did this go so horribly wrong and and it hit me on the plane

172
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,360
that because this is the same thing with with terrorist attacks it's the same thing with

173
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,920
airplane disasters any kind of natural disasters tsunamis you know I really have to

174
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:24,600
blame television and our hypnosis or I had not extinct because what what what happens

175
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,320
is that you discover that you know you don't have a right a god given right in whatever

176
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:37,320
country you live to be completely safe you know people always particularly in the US you know let's

177
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,520
let's sue because I got fucked you know because someone did something wrong or something went wrong

178
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,600
or wasn't explained to me properly because we're used to it you know we're used to all the

179
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,240
problems of the world being solved in 23 minutes and another seven minutes of commercials and

180
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,440
if that doesn't fix it then either judge duty or Oprah will you know this is this is what

181
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,160
is the problem we're used to this happy you know life and look at any movie once the last time

182
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,600
you saw a movie that ended you know on a downer note actually I'll take that back I saw

183
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:22,200
dissent a fine fine English production about a group of women girlfriends who go cave

184
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,160
exploring and run into all kinds of horrible things and basically they all die and and no one

185
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,400
gets out but then there's still kind of like a slight a slight you know happy note at the ending

186
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,240
and it's a very frightening movie by the way I made in silverwood so silverwood studios in the

187
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,920
UK yeah all shot on location but otherwise every single movie ends perfectly you remember

188
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,360
with 9-11 you saw what was happening to for me it was like okay you know Bruce Willis can

189
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,720
come in any minute now and save us and and that really was an automatic reaction I was waiting for

190
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,720
the scene change so I think that's a that's a big part of our problem is that we've gotten

191
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,720
very complete is it complacent maybe the right word lazy you know we're like hey you know it's

192
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,280
going to be fixed because there's always some superhero or you know some John Wayne guide that's

193
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,480
going to come in and save the day and we'll be okay and we've come to expect it but we're expecting

194
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:30,760
it not from not necessarily from our our own experience but but from television so maybe we should

195
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,440
think about that's why it's you know when you maybe that's part of what's so compelling about

196
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,880
reality television is that's that whole new experience of real life you know it's you know we

197
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,040
used to get our thrills from rollercoasters now you can get you you can get your thrills from real life

198
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,640
because it's a lot going on and what you see on television is not real life almost none of it is

199
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,480
and well yeah and again the XNTV experiment none of its real whenever there's a technical moment

200
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:05,400
a zoom a pan oh no a pan I think no a pan is okay a zoom or a because you can't do that with your

201
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,720
eyes you can pan with your eyes but you can't zoom jump cuts any kind of editing means it's not real

202
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:20,440
means you're not I just saw a date line NBC date line and Harry Connick Jr was going through

203
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,240
the streetwear's dad lives and it was caught up into a little it was really it was a beautiful piece

204
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,520
and you know he pulls a guy off his porch and and make sure he gets the safety and and he's driving

205
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,280
people to shelters but it was cut into drama you know it really was and essentially making

206
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,640
Harry Connick you know are our hero and which is fine but it's please this is not real reality is

207
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,320
the real heroes will never be seen on television because there was no one there to capture it to

208
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,840
capture those moments so let that be part of the lesson I think at least it was a lesson to me

209
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,400
and something that I've discussed with Christina and Patricia quite a bit now you know it's like hey you

210
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,920
we expect to be safe for all kinds of reasons and then you know another plane comes

211
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,440
now we haven't really spoken about it but 140 people done but 140 plus people died

212
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:22,520
it was a jacarta you know what is it well is it pilot error is it you know mechanical you know

213
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,280
what shit happens you know not every single airplane it's gonna fly forever you know

214
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,880
man what time is it it's 10 p.m. I'll display some more problems hello this is Chris Rockwell from

215
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,960
the Daily Download I'm here to ask for your assistance on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Katrina

216
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,440
we have all seen the terrible destruction that Katrina has caused hundreds of thousands of people have

217
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:58,040
been forced into homelessness thousands are feared dead and even more are dying as every day passes

218
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,960
these victims are not getting the help they need to survive and they are reliant on us

219
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,960
to help get them through this terrible event please help provide relief to these people

220
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,880
make a donation to the American Red Cross you can donate by clicking the American Red Cross logo

221
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:23,640
on this page or by calling 1-800 help them out Chris thank you Chris Chris Rockwell from the Daily

222
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:31,800
Download from his studio which is his bathroom I love it the way everyone is I mean you know

223
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:39,000
I love playing promos on this show this is what my inbox consists of it's all promos to raise awareness

224
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,720
and call out for help and donations to help the Red Cross and I'm very happy that this you know we

225
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,280
we've had lots of you know almost call them back channel conversations about you know there

226
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,600
was some thoughts about doing some kind of podathon or a telethon and and I'm not a big fan

227
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,720
of you know even when was tsunami relief I'm not a big fan of of doing that I think that's a

228
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:11,080
little bit it's passe because when we only had few media outlets and a few TV channels that we

229
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,680
didn't have the internet and news traveled much slower awareness was it was much harder to get

230
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,720
information in a timely basis it took a long time before you really knew the severity of a situation

231
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,680
or not and and telethons are very we're very important and raising awareness for that but in recent

232
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:36,440
years as you know you can get all the information very quickly and simply and you're on your own

233
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,960
and you can you know really slice and dice and make your own decisions based upon multiple just

234
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,200
thousands millions of different pieces of input to me it's almost like hey look how much money we

235
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,760
raised you know look look look what we did and I'm very happy that the Red Cross you know of course

236
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,760
the other work at the right organization to help out and in these these types of disasters

237
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:08,040
you know so there's no telethons there's no no big artists superstar gatherings because

238
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:15,240
it's unnecessary you know we can we are raising lots of money this way and I think it's probably

239
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:23,720
much more effective oh and we're talking about heroes a couple of the heroes who really helped out

240
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,040
in in the beginning in this of this horrible disaster are the ham radio operators I've received a

241
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,760
couple of emails from some of them because you know communications really got wiped out and for

242
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,480
all the the great communications that we have I mean take this podcast for instance you know I'm

243
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,000
recording this in the hotel room in New York which by the way has a partial park view if you

244
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,240
press your nose up against the glass and and look to the right you can just about sea central park

245
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,640
and it's you know it's came maybe it came automatically to your iPod if you're using iPodor

246
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:06,280
or if you're using iTunes we've got emails instant message cell phones but when it gets wiped out man

247
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,680
it's wiped out and you got it was you actually have to go back and you have to use the old school

248
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:18,280
technology which is radio radio frequency ham radio and in any disaster the ham radio operators are

249
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,440
always there they're setting up phone links and phone bridges and communication lines and open lines

250
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:31,400
and slow scan television pictures and the commend all of you you've done you've done a fantastic

251
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,840
job keep it up and you know it's kind of you know you probably left to learn more scode

252
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,480
to become a ham radio operator you got to know a lot of technology it's not you know you really

253
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,680
got to set out to do it if you want to get your license and and you've got to do it regularly

254
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:55,160
to maintain your contacts and here you go this is a great reason why and you know those are

255
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,840
networks that we often don't think about anymore and overlook but there's a lot of technology

256
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,400
going on in that space as well particularly when it comes to data communications and I don't know

257
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,640
all of it but I'm sure that mentioning this I'll get some email with some examples and I'd love

258
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,440
to hear some of the stories is to how the ham radio operators are kicked in on helping out and

259
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,440
perhaps that's a group that should be involved in conversations as we talk about you know getting

260
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:31,240
better getting better at handling disasters like this oh I got some some cool pod save music

261
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,040
which which will play in a second and also today in lieu of a hit test we've got the back tracks

262
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,480
podcast this is Andy and Matt from this skinny on sports athletes aren't the only ones that

263
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,000
can help out the people that have been devastated by hurricane Katrina and New Orleans although it's

264
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,080
great to see athletes like Kenny Smith hosting a charity game in Dion Sanders urging all athletes

265
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,680
to donate at least $1,000 to the hurricane Katrina Fund they're not the only people who can help

266
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,840
everyone can help out in every little bit counts you can head on over to redcross.org and you can

267
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,360
make your donations there to make sure that the money gets into the hands of the people who need

268
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,320
it the most while to have a link on our site at skinnyansports.com that you can follow to get to the

269
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:23,480
redcross and make a donation thanks to everyone who's helped out. Hi this is Don Misselli and

270
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,840
Drew Donk is from the Don Andrew Show Hurricane Katrina was a true tragedy and now the victims

271
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,800
need our help so many people are generously donating their hard earned money to communities they

272
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,160
may never even been to but you've got to be careful because many of these nonprofit organizations

273
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,880
are run with green in mind. So before you make that donation take a moment to look at charitynavigator.org.

274
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,680
Check their administrative costs they're pure analysis and if you simple pie charts that tell you

275
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:57,000
how they spend their donations. Make sure your donation gets into the hands of actual victims instead

276
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,160
of lining the pockets of the wealthy CEOs that are in close to a half a million dollars a year in salary.

282
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,720
something that I'd never ever listen to or select and I selected Latin and there's like pages of

283
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:51,480
Latin pod safe music. I'm totally totally amazed and I like it too. Flamenco passion makes

302
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:19,640
able to just put it in a full day then Patricia and Christina are leaving Friday after school

304
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,400
to first we're going to go to Virginia for some meetings then we're going to go or Washington i'm

305
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:39,160
sorry then we're going to Chicago then to San Francisco i'm basically in the states until almost the

306
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,360
end of the month wow so it's going to be a mega trip but i'm really excited about being in San

307
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:54,040
Francisco because we're really moving moving ahead quite nicely on really on on two tracks one

308
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,320
is for podcasters and we have a whole offering that we've been hinting about and we've been talking

309
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,240
about and we're getting very close to you know be able to make some dam announcements on that

310
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,800
as well as for the listener side which is as you know we're out to get at least a hundred million

311
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,640
listeners and that's only times time what we have today so i think that's very doable

312
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,320
and and a part of that includes we've talked about this before tools for the node manager's

313
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:30,440
really cleaning cleaning up the directory and things are moving along you know it's like so frustrating

314
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,560
from not only for myself but for a lot of people for Ron as well he's you know okay we've got the

315
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,840
funding even you know we're hiring the right people and we are one of done tomorrow dam it but of

316
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,240
course that's impossible particularly when it comes to development but we've got some great

317
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,640
great really smart people working on it and we'll be doing more job casts and and also introducing

318
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:58,440
more members of the pod show family as they join up and they'll tell you what they're working on

319
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,840
and a number of them already do their own podcast and so we should probably put together a list of

320
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:12,200
those as well because you know this is going to be a very very audible company I didn't mean

321
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,480
to come out that way we will be very vocal let's put it that way because hey we're in the podcast
